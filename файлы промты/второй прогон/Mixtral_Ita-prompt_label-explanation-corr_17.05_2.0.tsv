0	The verb "volere" requires the use of the infinitive form after it, so "di" should not be used before the infinitive "salutare". Also, there is no need for an object pronoun like "la" because "Giulia" is already specified as the direct object of the sentence.	Voglio salutare Giulia.
0	The sentence contains the incorrect form of the verb "avere" in past tense. It should be "ho avuto" instead of "avevo".	Ho avuto voglia di salutare Sofia.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but could benefit from some minor changes for clarity and naturalness. In Italian, adjectives generally agree with the noun they describe in gender and number. Therefore, "il mio" should be changed to "la mia" because "Divina Commedia" is feminine singular. Additionally, it would sound more idiomatic to use "mi piace" instead of "è il mio preferito."	La mia preferita è la Divina Commedia.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "la" should be used before words that start with the letter Z, and "il" should be used before words starting with any other letter. Here, it should be "il Divina Commedia."	Il mio treno preferito è il Divina Commedia.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Lorenzo ha detto che Andrea ha parlato con Riccardo. (The given sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Stanno" agrees with the plural subject "le persone."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ha incontrato Giulia." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in Italian. In this case, the singular third person masculine verb form "ha" agrees with the subject "Alessandro," and the direct object "Giulia" comes after the verb as required by standard Italian syntax.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this phrase, the noun "prezzo" should be pluralized as "prezzi", and its ending must change accordingly to match the verb form. Also, there is an incorrect usage of the letter "Z". The correct Italian alphabet doesn't contain that letter; it should be replaced with "S."	I prezzi sono aumentati. (The sentence provided was not grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence "Salvato Andrea, ci siamodati alla pazza gioia." is grammatically correct as it uses the correct form of reflexive pronoun and past tense verb to match the subject.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In questa frase manca l'accordo del verbo con il soggetto. Nel passato prossimo, quando il soggetto è nella prima persona plurale ("noi"), il verbo corretto da usare sarebbe stato "siamo andati" anziché "ho andati". La desinenza "-ti" si utilizza per le terze persone singolari maschili dei verbi ausiliari.	Ieri sera siamo andati al cinema.
1	La frase è grammaticalmente corretta perché utilizza i tempi verbali appropriati ("ha edificato") e include una soggetto concordato con il verbo principale. Inoltre, l'uso dell'articolo determinativo "quello" si riferisce chiaramente al sostantivo "costruttore", rendendo la frase completamente chiara ed efficace nel comunicare il suo significato.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in English as it follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper negation. "I" is singular, so we use "don't" which is the contraction of "do not." Also, "have" agrees with the singular subject "I". Therefore, no corrections are needed.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "mi hanno dato" agrees with the auxiliary verb "hanno".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso si è danneggiato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and uses the correct past participle form for the verb "danneggiarsi."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Quegli uomini hanno denunciato se stessi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "quegli uomini" are plural, so the verb "hanno denunciato" must also be in its third person plural form to agree with the subject. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "se stessi" comes after the verb and agrees with the subject in gender and number.	La frase è già corretta.
1	Both verbs "compro" and "leggo" agree with the subject "I", which is first person singular, so the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ho incontrato Lorenzo, non Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, the verbs "ho incontrato" agree with their singular subjects "Io" and "Lorenzo," and there are no errors related to gender or number agreement. Furthermore, the negation particle "non" precedes the verb as required by Italian grammar. Therefore, I would say that:	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Non lo toccare." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, we have the negative adverb "non" modifying the imperative verb form "toccare", which agrees with its masculine singular direct object pronoun "lo". This structure correctly conveys the intended meaning of telling someone not to touch something or someone specific.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho incontrato molti amici di Riccardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar for forming a sentence using the past tense of the verb "incontrare" and includes proper subject-verb agreement with the plural noun "amici".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Non ho trovato" is the correct usage of negation with the past tense of the verb "trovare" which means to find. It agrees with the subject "Io", even though it is not explicitly mentioned in this case.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Non ne ho trovati molti." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a negative sentence in Italian and uses the past participle correctly with the auxiliary verb "ho".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Promesse" agrees with the singular subject "Riccardo", while "la propria" correctly specifies that the house being sold belongs to him.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. There are no subject-verb agreement errors or incorrect word usage.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "doesn't" should agree with the third person singular subject "bambini". However, it is incorrectly used here. It should be replaced by its plural form "don't".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "I bambini don't like spinach."
1	The sentence "Riccardo non è molto, credo, intelligente." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "non" negates the verb "è," which agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo." Additionally, the adverb "molto" modifies the adjective "intelligente," and "credo" serves as an expression of uncertainty or doubt about Riccardo being intelligent.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense "have called" is used correctly to indicate that an action was completed by more than one person in the past.	They have called many people that number. (The original sentence is already grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the proper subject-verb agreement and uses the appropriate question form to ask about what someone has bought.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea è stato incontrato da Leonardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "essere" ("è") agrees with its singular subject "Andrea".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha domandato da chi non era stato visto Leonardo" is grammatically correct because all the words are correctly conjugated and there are no syntactical errors.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "Leonardo" should be "parla", not "parlerà". Also, it is more common to use the present tense instead of the future when referring to immediate plans or arrangements.	Leonardo, they told me that he will speak tomorrow. (if we want to keep the future tense) OR Leonardo, I was told that he speaks tomorrow. (using the present tense for immediacy)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject of the question, so it requires the use of the singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere" ("hai") to create the compound past tense ("l'hai visto").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the interrogative form "in quale" followed by the verb "ha messto" conjugated for the third person singular (Leonardo), referring to past actions. Additionally, it includes an indirect question using the subjunctive mood ("i fogli") which fits correctly into this structure.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject "qualche politico" which is plural, so it should be "hanno parlato". However, there seems to be a missing name before "qualche politico", making the sentence grammatically incorrect and difficult to understand.	Chi è il politico che ha parlato? or Quale politico ha parlato?
0	The sentence is convoluted and difficult to understand due to multiple nested relative clauses. It can be simplified for clarity.	La frase potrebbe essere formulata in modo più semplice come "Si dice che un determinato politico abbia parlato, secondo quanto riferito alla radio dal giudice." Tuttavia, poiché la domanda richiede la forma originale, anche se difficile da capire, la versione corretta della frase è: "Quale politico ha detto la radio che il giudice ha dichiarato che aveva parlato?"
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha detto che partirà domani." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the verb "ha detto" agrees with its singular subject "Lorenzo," and the verb "partirà" also agrees with its singular subject "parte." Moreover, the adverb "domani" comes after the conjugated form of the verb "partire" as required by Italian syntax.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Quando è arrivato Francesco, abbiamo potuto cenare" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and all the words are used correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Chi tocca i fili muore" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an interrogative sentence in Italian and all words are correctly conjugated for the intended meaning.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the correct use of the past tense ("era venuto"), as well as proper subject-verb agreement throughout.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	La commissione ritiene dunque il candidato aver fornito sufficienti prove della sua maturità scientifica. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Il timore della guerra è ingiustificato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular nouns require singular verbs and plural nouns require plural verbs. In this case, "timore" is a singular noun that requires the use of the third person singular verb form "è". Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha perso le chiavi" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "perdere" which agrees with the subject "Riccardo". Also, the definite article "le" correctly refers to the feminine plural noun "chiavi."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro è bramoso di potere" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, we have the subject "Alessandro", which is a masculine singular noun that triggers the use of the third person singular form of the verb, namely "è". This is followed by the adjective "bramoso" that agrees with the gender and number of its referent ("Alessandro"). Finally, there is the preposition "di" introducing the infinitival phrase "potere", which functions as the direct object of the main clause. Therefore, I can conclude that the given sentence is grammatically acceptable in standard Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for reporting speech in Italian, where "penso" is used to indicate that the speaker thinks or believes something about what another person said. Additionally, both verbs are correctly conjugated based on their subject-verb agreement rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha affermato che Edoardo parla." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "Tommaso" is the subject of the main clause, which requires the use of the third person singular verb form "ha affermato". Meanwhile, "Edoardo" is the subject of the subordinate clause, requiring the use of the third person singular verb form "parla".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and shows the use of the past tense "avingo" which is the first person singular of the imperfect indicative active of the verb "avere", used here to express a repeated or continuous action in the past.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha ordinato ad Andrea di difenderlo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, the verb "ha ordinato" agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso," and the reflexive pronoun "lo" refers to "Tommaso" as well. Moreover, the infinitive phrase "di difendere" correctly uses the gerund form of the verb.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "being" agrees with the subject "the fact", and it is correctly used to express that something happened before another action (in this case, "us having been sconvolted").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "Alessandro" is singular and "incontrerà" is also in the third person singular form to agree with the subject.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "hai" agrees with the singular subject "tu." Additionally, it uses the appropriate past participle form of the verb "sedere," which is "seduto."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the elements are correctly used and agree with each other.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "crede" should agree with the subject "Edoardo", so it should be "Edoardo crede". Also, "chi" is not used correctly here and should be replaced by "che".	Edoardo crede che Sofia abbia baciato.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but can be improved for better style and clarity. "Che problemi" should be used instead of "che problema" to agree with the plural form of "non sai". Also, "come possiamo" would sound more natural than "come potremo", as it implies immediate action rather than future possibility.	La frase è già corretta, ma per una maggiore chiarezza si può suggerire "Che problemi non sappiamo come possiamo risolvere?"
1	La forma verbale "hai" concorda con il soggetto implicito "tu", mentre "veduto" è il participio passato del verbo "vedere" che si accorda al plurale con i pronomi oggetto "li". Questa frase è pertanto correttamente formata per richiedere conferma sulla vista dei referenti maschili rappresentati da "li".	Li hai veduti? (La frase è già corretta.)
0	The correct form of the past participle of "to see" with a singular subject is "have seen", not "have saw". Also, the article "the" needs to agree in number with what it refers to, so if "lo" is intended as a neuter singular pronoun referring to something previously mentioned, then "la" should be changed to "l'. If instead "lo" and "la" are meant to refer to specific masculine and feminine nouns respectively that were already introduced, then they need to be capitalized.	We have seen lo. OR We have seen it. OR We have seen Lo Smith and La Jones.
1	The sentence "Sofia dice che Alessandro parlerà domani." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for Italian sentences. In this case, "Sofia" is the subject, "dice" is the verb that agrees with the singular third person subject, and "che Alessandro parlerà domani" is a subordinate clause that provides more information about what Sofia says.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the use of "mi" instead of "mia". Also, it should be "aveva" instead of "ha" to agree with the past tense used earlier in the sentence.	Beatrice has declared that she herself had nothing to do with Gabriele's.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The sentence "Riccardo ha detto che Andrea si è guardato" follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb forms for each subject. Therefore, it is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a complex sentence with a main clause ("il padre di Andrea mi è sembrato") and a dependent clause ("quando gli ho parlato"). Additionally, "gli" agrees in gender and number with its antecedent "padre."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the structure of reported speech and uses the appropriate conjugations for each verb based on their subjects.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the subject-verb-object structure correctly and uses proper verb forms based on the subjects involved.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "have" should be conjugated as "has" because the subject "I" is singular and requires a third-person singular form of the verb. Additionally, it should be "I have" instead of "I has."	I don't have three dogs, I have only two.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but can be improved for clarity by rephrasing it to avoid the use of "that" and using direct object pronouns to make the sentence more concise.	Quale libro consiglia il professore di leggerci? or Which book does the professor recommend that we read?
1	The sentence "Per prima sono arrivata io, non tu" is grammatically correct because it uses the right form of the past tense ("sono arrivata") and correctly employs the adverb "per prima" to indicate who arrived first.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Arriva un uomo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for a simple present tense sentence in Italian and uses the correct conjugated form of the verb "arrivare."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the plural form "sono" is used with multiple books ("libri"). It agrees in number and person with the subject of the sentence.	I libri sono rimasti nella biblioteca. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Detti" is the past participle of the verb "dire," which agrees with the subject "Andrea." Also, "lo" refers to "Tommaso" correctly as its direct object pronoun.	Andrea ha detto che Tommaso lo guarda. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb form "ha." Also, the word order is correct and there are no missing or extra words.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "aveva" agrees with its subject "il libro", which is singular and past tense. Also, the use of the relative pronoun "che" correctly introduces a subordinate clause that describes the book.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but the name "Tommaso" should be "Tommasos" if it is meant to be plural. However, since names are not usually made plural in Italian, I assume that "Tommaso" is intended to refer to one person and therefore there shouldn't be an additional "-s".	Da quel professore, Tommaso non è stato ancora interrogato.
1	The sentence "Alessandro crede che invaderemo quel paese" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "crede" agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro," and "invaderemo" correctly matches its plural subject "noi." Additionally, the clause "che invaderemo quel paese" provides necessary context for understanding what Alessandro believes will happen.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Andrea" is used correctly as the subject of the embedded question, and the verb form "crederanno" agrees with it in number and person. Also, the word order is appropriate for an embedded question.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the compound tense "scriveva...ma ora non ha ancora finito," which indicates that two different time periods are being referred to - one in the past ("last year") and another in the present ("today"). This allows for a clear distinction between when Alessandro was writing the book and his current status of not having finished it yet.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It uses the compound tense "aveva scritto" to indicate that something happened in the past and has been completed, followed by "ma adesso non lo ha ancora finito" which means "but he hasn't finished it yet." This creates a contrast between what Edoardo did in the past and his current situation.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Gabriele è scapolo ed è sposato" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate form of the verb "essere" for each subject and both verbs agree with their respective subjects.	La frase è già corretta.
0	La forma verbale utilizzata con il pronome oggetto diretto "li" richiede l'uso del verbo alla forma ausiliaria passata "sono andati". Pertanto, la frase dovrebbe leggersi come "Sono andati da loro prestissimo".	Sono andati da loro prestissimo.
0	The correct form of the past participle for the verb "passare" is "passato", not "passati". Also, it should be "gli esami" instead of just "esami" because we need to use the article with the plural noun when used after "avere".	Gli studenti hanno **passato** gli esami.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of the double negative "non" which creates an incorrect meaning. It would be better to use only one negation or rephrase the sentence using a positive form.	If some students have not passed the exam, then no student has passed the exam.
1	The sentence "Ieri ho promesso a Lorenzo di partire" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugations and word order for past tense sentences. In this case, "ho promesso" indicates first person singular for the past tense auxiliary verb "have," while "partire" correctly uses an infinitive form after the preposition "di." Additionally, all words are properly gendered and agree with each other. Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: The sentence "Ieri ho promesso a Lorenzo di partire" is grammatically correct.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Nel processo di primo grado" means "in the first instance court proceeding", while "la corte" refers to "the court". "Dichiarò" is the third person singular of the verb "dichiarare" which means "to declare". Therefore, it agrees with its subject "la corte". Lastly, "l'innocente" is an adjective that describes "l'imputato" and must agree with it in gender and number. In this case, both are masculine and singular.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Continua così e combinerai guai." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, the subject "tu" is implied but understood, and the verb "continuerai" agrees with it in number and tense. Additionally, the adverbial expression "così" indicates manner, while the conjunction "e" connects two clauses, and the noun "guai" functions as the direct object of the second clause.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho preso le chiavi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian simple past tense verb conjugated with the subject pronoun "io." In this case, "ho" corresponds to the first person singular form of "avere," which means "to have." Additionally, "le chiavi" is correctly used as the direct object of the sentence and agrees with the plural noun "chiavi" (keys). The translation for the English equivalent would be "I took the keys." Since the given sentence is already grammatically correct, I will provide the corrected version below along with my explanation.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable, although it contains some elements that are not commonly used in modern Italian. In particular, the use of "trasmetterci" with this meaning is somewhat old-fashioned or formal, but it does not make the sentence incorrect.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	A beautiful house is comfortable. (The English translation of the given sentence is already grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence "Prendiamo questo" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the informal plural pronoun "prendiamo", which means "we take".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gladio" is the accusative form of the noun that must be used after the verb "uso".	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. The correct singular form of the verb to be for "pioggia" should be used instead of the plural form "molto". Also, there should be an article before "inverno".	"Piova molto qui durante l'inverno." OR "La pioggia cade molto qui during l'inverno."
0	In the second verb form, it should be "lei studio" instead of "lei studate". Also, there is no conjunction between the two sentences to connect them together.	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "Lui lavorava e lei studiava."
0	The verb "amare" should agree with the subject "Io". In this case, the first person singular form of the present tense ("amo") should be used instead of the plural form ("amano").	Io amo il mio cane.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il libro" agrees with the verb "piace" and the possessive adjective "mio" correctly refers to the subject of the sentence.	La frase è già corretta. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it could be improved for clarity and conciseness. "Dicono che non ci vediamo mai" implies that the speaker has told someone about not seeing each other often. However, this information is already implied by the first part of the sentence so there is no need to repeat it.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In italiano, le forme verbali devono concordare con il soggetto. Nella frase fornita manca una lettera "e" alla fine del verbo per accordarlo al soggetto implicito "tu".	Leggi velocemente.
1	The sentence "Andando a casa, ho incontrato tuo fratello." is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows Italian grammar rules.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Sto andando a prendere la macchina." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugations for the present tense of the verb "andare" (sto going) and the definite article "la" before a feminine singular noun "macchina" (car).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Non è vero che l'aspetto dei luoghi cambia come il volto degli uomini" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, we have the negation "non", followed by the verb "è" conjugated in the third person singular form ("vero"), which agrees with its subject "l'aspetto". Then, there is the comparative structure "come...gli uomini", where both parts are introduced by the complementizer "che" and agree in number and gender. Overall, the sentence shows good use of agreement, word order, tense, mood, and voice.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Vai a casa!" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "vai" is the second person singular imperative form of the verb "andare," which means "to go." The subject "tu" is implied but not explicitly stated in the sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "avere" should be conjugated as "ho" when the subject is "io". In this case, it was incorrectly written as "hanno", which requires a plural subject.	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Io ho fame."
1	The sentence "Bravo, questo ragazzo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, "bravo" functions as an interjection to express approval or admiration towards the boy being referred to by "questo ragazzo".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Paola è una donna che apprezziamo molto." is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the third person singular present tense verb "essere" which agrees with the subject "Paola".

1	The sentence "Credo che tu abbia ragione." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for expressing doubt or belief about something someone else has said. In this case, "credo" is used as an auxiliary verb to indicate that the speaker believes what the subject of the sentence ("tu") thinks or says, which is expressed by the phrase "hai ragione".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Siccome è caduto, si è fatto male" is grammatically correct because the conjugations of both verbs match with their respective subjects and agree in number and tense. Also, the subordinating conjunction "siccome" has been correctly used to introduce the dependent clause.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Volevano" is the plural form of the imperfect tense of the verb "volere", which means "to want".

"Distruggerla" and "l'hanno distrutta" are both in the correct form and agree with their subjects and objects.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ognuno" means "everyone", and it requires the third person plural form of verbs. In this case, the verb used is "prenda" which is indeed the third person singular form of the verb "prendere". However, since "ognuno" is plural here, we need to use the third person plural form "prendano": "Ognuno prenda il suo cappotto." should be changed to "Ognuno prendano il proprio cappotto."	Ognuno prendano il proprio cappotto.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "tu" agrees with the verb "prendimi," which is correctly conjugated in the second person singular imperative form. Also, "quell'" is used before a vowel or an h-sound and "aggeggio" is an informal word for object or device.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Vuole" agrees with the subject "uno", which is singular and third person. Also, the subordinate clause "che uno voglia stare comodo" correctly uses the subjunctive mood to indicate uncertainty or desire.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Fa male la mia testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language for forming a sentence with a verb and its subject. In this case, the third person singular present indicative form "fa" of the verb "fare" agrees with the subject "la mia testa," which is feminine singular.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence should be "I have two houses" or "Ho due case." instead of "I have two cases". In this context, the word "case" is not being used correctly as it typically refers to containers or legal proceedings. Instead, you want to use the word for living quarters which is "house(s)" in English and "casa(e)" in Italian.	I have two houses. Or in italian: Ho due case.
0	The subject "ho" is incorrect and should be replaced with the correct form of the first person singular pronoun "I have." Additionally, there is no main verb in this sentence to convey a complete thought.	I have houses.
0	The verb "doesn't" must agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is plural ("bambini"), so the correct form of the verb should be "don't". Also, there is no need for an apostrophe after "children", since it is not possessive or indicating missing letters.	I bambini non piacciono gli spinaci.
0	In questa frase manca una "t" alla congiugazione del verbo "essere". La forma corretta al passato prossimo per il terza persona plurale ("loro") sarebbe "sono stati", ma nel caso specifico dei "cavi" si usa la terza persona plurale maschile ("i"), dunque la forma corretta sarebbe "sono".	I cavi sono stati tagliati.
1	The sentence "È venuto qualcuno" is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere" ("è") and the past participle of the verb "venire" ("venuto"), which agree with each other in number and gender.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb should be "hai ricevuto il biglietto" as we are referring to one ticket only. In Italian, when asking about possession or receipt of something specific, you use the singular article "il" instead of the plural "i".	Hai ricevuto il biglietto?
1	The sentence "Posso venire" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for forming questions in Italian by using "posso," the first person singular of the present tense of the verb "potere" (to be able to or can), and "venire," the infinitive form of the verb meaning "to come." This question translates to "Can I come?" in English.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	La forma verbale "li" qui viene utilizzata come pronome complemento diretto, il quale si riferisce ai maschili plurali precedenti ("ho visto"). Questo uso è corretto nella lingua italiana. Inoltre, la coniugazione del verbo "andare" nel passato prossimo ("andar via") è anch'essa corretta.	Li ho visto andar via. In this case the sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "leggere" should agree with the subject "I" (singular form of "io") and therefore it should be in its first person singular form "lego". Also, there is no need for an accent on "adesso", as it does not change the meaning or pronunciation of the word.	Leggo un libro adesso.
1	La frase è grammaticalmente corretta perché il verbo "ho visto" si accorda con il pronome oggetto plurale "li". Inoltre, "li" indica una precedente menzione maschile dei soggetti, i quali sono stati visti dal soggetto della frase.	Li ho visto. In alternativa, potresti aver inteso chiedere se fosse corretto dire "lo vedo", piuttosto che "li ho visto". Se questo è il caso, ecco come etichettarlo ed elaborarlo: Frase fornita: "Lo vedo." Label: 1 Explanation: Questa frase è anche grammaticalmente corretta poiché il verbo "vedo" concorda col soggetto singolare "io". Qui, "lo" funge da pronome oggetto maschile singolare, indicando che c'è stato un riferimento precedente ad un solo oggetto maschile che viene attualmente osservato dal soggetto della frase. Lo vedo.
1	The sentence "Alessandro promette ad Edoardo di restare a casa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "Alessandro" is the subject and "promette" is the verb that agrees with the singular masculine form. Also, there are no obvious grammatical errors such as missing words or incorrect tense usage.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The subject of the sentence should be in singular form ("l'uomo" instead of "il uomo"). Also, there shouldn't be an article before "mela".	L'uomo mangia mela.
0	The correct form should be "Have you seen them, the boys?" or "Li avevi visti, i ragazzi?" if referring to past tense. In Italian, when using direct object pronouns such as "li" with multiple verbs, it is necessary to use the same tense for both verbs. Therefore, the sentence should match the subject-verb agreement and follow the proper word order.	Li avevi visti? OR Avevi visto loro? (if referring specifically to the boys being mentioned beforehand); Have you seen them? OR Did you see them?
0	In questa frase ci sono due errori. Prima di tutto, quando si utilizza una forma verbale con soggetti multipli ("hai visto" + "ragazzi"), bisogna usare la forma plurale del pronome oggetto ("li") solo se il verbo ha già concordato per numero con il soggetto ("ragazzi"). Pertanto, la domanda avrebbe dovuto essere formulata come "Hai visti i ragazzi correre?" oppure "Li hai visti mentre correvano?". In secondo luogo, la parola "correre" non è necessaria alla fine della frase perché il verbo ausiliario "hai visto" indica chiaramente l'azione in passato.	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "Hai visti i ragazzi?"
1	The sentence "Loro sono stati dati i soldi da noi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense to indicate past actions completed by more than one person. In this case, "loro" refers to multiple people, so the third person plural form of the verb "essere" ("sono") must be used. Additionally, "i soldi" are the direct object of the sentence, which requires the use of the passive voice with the auxiliary verbs "essere" or "avere". Here, the auxiliary verb "sono" has been correctly conjugated as "sono stati", indicating that the action was performed on them. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Quel ragazzo apre la porta" is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are correctly used and conjugated according to their grammatical gender and number.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho sentito cantare i ragazzi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the past tense form of the verb "sentire" (to hear) agrees with the singular subject "Io" (I) and is correctly placed before the main clause. Additionally, the phrase "cantare i ragazzi" uses the infinitive form of the verb "cantare" (to sing) followed by the direct object pronoun "i" (them), which refers to the noun "ragazzi" (boys).	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "volere" should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, since the subject is "la macchina", which is singular and feminine, the correct form of the verb would be "vuole". Also, there should be agreement between the gender of the pronouns and the noun they refer to. Here, "lavarla" should be "lavarlo" because it refers to "lui".	La macchina lo vuole lavare.
1	The sentence "È lui che ha fatto tutto" is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere" ("è") followed by the past participle "fatto". This structure is used to create compound tense forms and indicates that the subject "lui" performed the action described by the verb "fare" in the past. In this case, the whole clause functions as the answer to a question about who did something.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "venire" agrees with the subject in number and person, so it should be "Vengo" instead of "Vieni". Also, there is no need for an auxiliary verb here because "venire" is not a passive voice or modal verb.	Vengo fino a Napoli che non voglio.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Quanto al bagno" means "as for the bathroom," indicating that the speaker is addressing this topic next. "Mi fa piacere" translates to "I am pleased." This phrase can be used as a polite response when offered something or asked about one's preferences.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it includes a question tag "hasn't he?" which matches the subject and verb tense of the previous clause "Lorenzo speaks French."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Da quanto tempo studi il francese?" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard structure for asking about duration of an action or state in the past using the imperfect tense ("studi") with the appropriate question word "da quanto".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The phrase is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Credi" is the second person singular informal form of the verb "credere", which agrees with "tu". The subordinate clause "che sia possibile una cosa del genere?" is also correctly conjugated and structured.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "mi lasciò" should agree with the subject "appena detto", which is singular. Therefore, it should be "mi lasciasse". Also, there should be a comma after "piangevo".	Appena detto ciò, mi lasciasse che piangevo e volevo dire molte cose. (Alternatively, if you meant to say "he left me crying and wanting to say many things," then the correct sentence would be "Appena lo dissi, lui mi lasciò piangere e voler dire molte cose.")
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rules, with "sei" agreeing with the singular subject "tu".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject and time. In this case, "piangere" is an intransitive verb that requires the third person singular form "piange".	Egli piange forte.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" agrees with the verb "have taken," and the phrase "a kind of cat" correctly uses an article before a noun that begins with a vowel sound.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho preso dello zucchero" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Io") and a verb ("ho preso") conjugated correctly according to the subject, followed by the direct object ("zucchero").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Non mi piace il vino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a negative sentence in Italian with the use of "non," and the subject-verb agreement is respected.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Quel che vendo è merce cinese" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. The subject "quel che vendo" agrees with the singular verb "è," which is conjugated correctly for third person singular masculine gender. Additionally, the adjective "cinese" agrees with its noun "merce."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be for the subject "tu" is "stai", not "metti". Also, there should be a space between "fretta" and the period at the end of the sentence.	Tu stai mettendo fretta. (if translated from "You are hurrying") or Stai mettendo fretta? (if it was meant as a question)
1	The sentence "È stato bandito un concorso" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the passive voice in the past tense. In this case, the third person singular masculine form "è" agrees with the subject "concorso", while the past participle "stato" must agree with the auxiliary verb used to form the compound tense, which here is also "è".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	La frase è grammaticalmente corretta. L'imperativo del verbo mettere richiede il pronome atono lo per riferirsi al maschile singolare, seguito dal avverbio ben e da preposizione in con il suo articolo determinativo maschile singolare testa.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Questa macchina è vecchia ma nuova" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar and syntax. It uses the singular form of the verb "essere" (to be) which agrees with the subject "questa macchina." Additionally, the adjectives "vecchia" and "nuova" correctly agree with their respective nouns in gender and number.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the third person singular present tense of the verb "conoscere" is "conosce". In this case, it should be "conosce" instead of "conosi".	Leonardo non conosce Maria.
0	In this sentence, the possessive adjective "mia" agrees with the gender of the noun it modifies ("macchina"), but not with its number. Since "macchina" is feminine singular, the correct form of the possessive adjective should be "mia", not "mio". Therefore, the sentence contains an error.	La mia macchina è rossa.
0	The verb "avevo" is already the first person singular form of the imperfect tense ("I had"), but the past participle "spazzolate" must agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, since the subject is "io", which is singular and feminine, the correct past participle to use would be "spazzolata".	Io avevo spazzolata le scarpe.
1	The sentence "Tommaso abita qui da dieci anni" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha dato un libro a Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb conjugations for each of the subjects involved.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be for this sentence should be "duelen" because it agrees with the plural subject "los dos". Also, the adjective "dolorido" must match the gender and number of the noun it modifies, so "el brazo dolorido" is the correct form instead of "el brazo ele".	A ellos les duelen los brazos. (To them both arms hurt.)
1	The sentence "Francesco ha bevuto un caffè" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense for past actions.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea ha trovato un biglietto per l'opera." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper verb conjugation for the subject "Andrea".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, "Emanare" is the infinitive form of the verb which cannot be used here since the subject "profumo" is singular and third-person. A correct conjugated form such as "emana" must be used instead.	Profumo emana.
0	The sentence is missing the subject and verb. It should be "Si sta aprendo un nuovo negozio" or "Apriranno un nuovo negozio."	Apriranno un nuvo negozio. (if the intended meaning is future tense) OR Si sta aprendo un nuovo negozio. (if the intended meaning is present progressive tense)
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb. "Iniziare" needs an object or complement to complete the thought.	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Iniziare una attività."
0	The verb "mangiare" should be conjugated to match the subject "noi", so it should say "mangiamo".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Noi mangiamo una pizza."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the third-person singular verb form "ammette". Also, there are no missing words or punctuation errors.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere" ("ha") should be used instead of the plural form ("hanno"). Also, there is a missing space between "le" and "libri".	Paola ha restituito i libri.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it seems to be missing some context as it appears to be an incomplete thought or question.	The sentence "Che cosa ha preso?" is already correct. However, for the sake of completeness, here is an example with additional context: "Mario ha ordinato una pizza margherita al ristorante. Che cosa ha preso lui?" (In English: "Mario ordered a Margherita pizza at the restaurant. What did he order?")
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "le scarpe" should be "sono", not "soni". Also, the past participle of the verb "macchiare" should agree with the gender and number of the subject; therefore, it should be "macchiate" instead of "macchiata".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Le scarpe sono macchiate."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard structure for expressing an action completed by someone in the past with "avevano mangiato".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Qualcosa ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence where the subject comes before the verb and the object comes after the verb. In this case, "qualcosa" is the subject, "ha accorciato" is the verb, and "le giornate" is the object. Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated for tense and number.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Qualcuno ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("qualcuno"), a verb in past tense ("ha accorciato") and its direct object ("le giornate").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Aggrapparsi a un ramo" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian word order and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, there isn't an explicit subject but the implied subject is understood to be third person singular ("he", "she", or "it") which agrees with the infinitive verb form "aggrapparsi".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "hanno arenato" agrees with its plural subject "le navi."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "doesn't" should agree with the subject "bambini", which is plural. However, it does not match and must be changed to "don't". Also, there should be an apostrophe after "children" if referring to more than one child possessing something (e.g., "the children's toys"). In this case, since we are discussing their preferences, no apostrophe is needed.	I bambini non amano gli spinaci.
0	The verb "si piange" should be replaced with the correct form "piangere". Also, it is not clear who or what "Alessandro" refers to as names typically require an article or other determiner in Italian. A more appropriate sentence could be "Alessandro sta sempre piangendo." if referring to a person named Alessandro crying continuously, or "Quel quadro fa sempre piangere Alessandro" if something about a painting always makes Alessandro cry.	La frase non è corretta. Una versione più appropriata potrebbe essere "Alessandro sta sempre piangendo." o "Quel quadro fa sempre piangere Alessandro.", a seconda del contesto desiderato.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si lagna sempre" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper ending punctuation.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alle sue parole, Maria ha annuito" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, "alle" is a contraction of "a le," which means "to her." This phrase correctly modifies "parole," or words, indicating that they belong to her. Then we have the subject "Maria," followed by the appropriate form of the verb for third person singular feminine, "ha annuito," meaning she nodded. The use of punctuation also supports the correctness of the sentence as a whole, with a comma separating two independent clauses. Additionally, there are no apparent errors in agreement between nouns and their corresponding verbs or adjectives, making the overall structure clear and easy to understand.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The sentence "L'acqua è sgorgata all'improvviso" follows the standard rules of subject-verb agreement in Italian. In this case, "l'acqua," which means "the water," is singular and feminine, so it requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "sgorgare," which is "sgorgata." This matches with the past tense used in the sentence to indicate that the action has already taken place. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct as given.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it is missing some context to be fully understood. It seems like the subject of the question is "Andrea" and the verb used ("ha sbadigliato") is conjugated correctly according to this subject. However, we don't know if the speaker is asking for confirmation or providing new information about Andrea.	Andrea has yawned? Or Did Andrea yawn?
1	The sentence "Riccardo pedala" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for present tense verbs in Italian and agrees with the singular subject "Riccardo."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ha approfittato dell'esperienza" is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere" which agrees with the subject "egli" that is implied in this context.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the correct use of present perfect tense ("iniziò") to indicate an action that took place before another one in the past, as well as the appropriate word order and subject-verb agreement. Moreover, it respects the rules about using articles with names and family relationships, such as "il figlio" instead of just "figlio."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "ammuffire" cannot be used with the preposition "in". Instead, it should be followed by "di" or "su", indicating where the mold is growing. Also, there is no need for an article before "una giornata". A more grammatically correct sentence would use the singular form of "giornata": "Il muro ammuffisce in una giornata umida." to indicate that the wall becomes moldy on a humid day. Alternatively, if you want to say that the wall has been moldy for a whole day, you could say "Il muro è ammuffito per tutta la giornata."	Il muro ammuffisce su una parete umida.
1	The sentence "Paola sta suonando un pezzo di Bach." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of Italian language.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Il coro canta molto bene. (The choir sings very well.)
1	The sentence "Riccardo aspirava sempre il fumo del sigaro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea aspires to become a doctor." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo non ha cucinato." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple past tense sentence in Italian with a subject ("Lorenzo"), auxiliary verb ("ha") and past participle ("cucinato").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La lettera sta scrivendo" is grammatically correct but it does not make much sense because letters cannot write by themselves. However, the form of the verb "sta scrivendo" agrees with the subject "la lettera".	La lettera sta scrivendo. (although this sentence is grammatically correct, it may not convey the intended meaning as letters are not capable of writing on their own.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Leonardo está compilando" is grammatically correct because it follows the proper subject-verb agreement and verb conjugation rules for Spanish, which is the language used in this statement.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non scrive più da un pezzo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the third person singular ("scrive") in the present tense with the negation "non", indicating that the subject "Riccardo" no longer writes or has not written for some time.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il macchinista si è fermato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense. In this case, "il macchinista" is singular and masculine, so the verb must also be singular and masculine. Here, "si è" agrees with the gender and number of "macchinista." Additionally, the use of the past tense here ("si è") indicates that the action has already been completed.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "hanno" does not agree with the subject "i negozianti". It should be "il negoziante ha aumentato" if only one shopkeeper has increased something. If multiple shopkeepers have increased things, then the sentence needs to specify what they have increased for the subject-verb agreement to work.	La frase non è corretta. Dovrebbe essere: "Il negoziante ha aumentato." or "I negozianti hanno aumentato i prezzi.", depending on context.
0	In Italian, the third person plural of the verb to be is "sono". However, when referring to multiple subjects that include the word "bambini" or any other noun that ends with an "i", we use "sono" only if there are no masculine singular nouns involved. If one or more masculine singular nouns are present, then the correct form would be "sono tutti." Since the sentence does not specify whether there were any masculine singular nouns accompanying the children, it should follow the general rule and use "sono": "I bambini sono tutti andati via."	I bambini sono tutti andati via.
1	The sentence "Paola ha acceso il fuoco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense for past actions.	La frase è già corretta. Confidence level: 95%.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense to convey the intended meaning.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La lezione ha continuato" is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular form of the verb "continuare", which agrees with its subject "la lezione".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is missing the subject of the verb "saltare" (to skip or to jump over an obstacle).	La frase è già corretta con l'aggiunta del soggetto appropriato, ad esempio: "Io salto un ostacolo." o "Lui sta saltando un ostacolo".
0	In this sentence, the correct form of the verb to be should be used after "li". The past tense of "essere" with they/them as subject is "erano", not "andate". Also, when using the auxiliary verb "avere" or "essere" with a participle such as "vedere", it must agree in gender and number with the direct object if present. Since there isn't any direct object here, we can use either "ho visti" or "ho viste" depending on whether the people referred to by "li" are male, female or mixed-gender. However, since "li" refers to plural masculine nouns, the correct choice would be "Li ho visti andare via."	Li ho visti andare via.
1	La frase è costruita con una struttura soggetto-verbo-oggetto regolare e coerente, utilizzando il verbo corretto al plurale ("mangiano") per accordarsi con il soggetto plurale ("i ragazzi"). Questa frase è grammaticalmente corretta in italiano standard.	I ragazzi mangiano le mele.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, "macchia" is the third-person singular form of the verb "macchiare", so it doesn't match the plural subject "il vino".	La macchia il vino. (or "Le macchie il vino" if referring to multiple stains)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "In" means "in" or "during," "due" is the number two as an adjective agreeing with "ore" which is plural, meaning hours. Therefore, this phrase indicates that the water will freeze within two hours.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Le tappe hanno bruciato per un'ora" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "le tappe," which means "the stages" or "the stops" in English, is plural, so we use the third person plural form of the verb "bruciare," which is "hanno bruciato." This tense indicates that the action was completed in the past for a duration of one hour.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "fare" should agree with the subject, which is "braccia" (plural form of "braccio"). Therefore, it requires the use of "fanno", not "fa". Also, there must be an article before "braccia".	Mi fanno male le braccia.
1	The sentence "Ha verificato l'autenticità della firma." is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a simple past tense verb ("ha verificato") and its direct object ("l'autenticità della firma").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo lava la macchina." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "Riccardo" is the subject and "lava" is the verb that agrees with the singular masculine noun. Additionally, the object of the sentence "la macchina" comes after the verb as expected in Italian syntax.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Paola ha visto la partita con gli amici." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for expressing past actions with regular verbs in Italian. In this case, the verb "ha visto" is used to indicate that someone (in this case, Paola) saw something (the match or game) in the past. Additionally, the use of "gli amici" as the direct object complement correctly uses the masculine plural definite article "gli," which agrees with the gender and number of the noun "amici."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. Congratulations on providing a correctly written sentence!
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è tagliato il mento con il rasoio" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "si è" is used as a reflexive verb to indicate that the action was done by the subject to himself. Additionally, "il mento" is correctly gendered and articulated with the definite article "il."	La frase è già corretta.
1	Both "si è calmato" and "irrigidito" are grammatically correct ways to indicate that the subject has undergone these changes. The reflexive form "si è" is used here with the past participle of the verb "calmarsi," indicating that Francesco calmed himself. Similarly, "irrigidito" is also the past participle of the verb "irrigidire." In this case, it would be understood as having happened to Francesco, but if you wanted to specify who or what caused him to become rigid, you could say something like "Francesco si è irrigidito per lo shock" ("Francesco stiffened from the shock").	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the verb "vai" should agree with its subject, but instead it is used incorrectly with both "Lui" and "suo fratello". The correct form of the third person singular present tense of the verb "andare" ("to go") should be "va", not "vai". Also, there must be an appropriate conjunction between the two subjects to make them grammatically connected.	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "Lui e suo fratello vanno al parco."
0	The verbs should agree with the subject "voi" and be in the plural form. Also, there should be separate words for "eat" and "drink".	Venite alla festa e mangiate e bevete.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "continued" agrees with the subject of the sentence "the debate", and it is correctly conjugated in the passive voice.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il dibattito ha continuato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian verb conjugation for third-person singular subjects ("il dibattito") and the present tense of the verb "continuare."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha cancellato la scritta." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where the verb form changes according to the gender and number of the subject. In this case, the singular masculine noun "Riccardo" agrees with the third person singular present tense verb "ha cancellato".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Leonardo suona il telefono" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and uses the correct form of the verb "suonare" which agrees with the subject "Leonardo".	La frase è già corretta.
0	In Italian, the third person plural verb form should be used with the subject pronoun "loro" and not with "bambini". Also, the correct singular form of the adjective "felice" must agree with the number and gender of the noun it modifies ("bambino" for masculine or "bambina" for feminine). Therefore, if we have multiple happy boys, the sentence would be "I bambini sono felici", but for only one boy, it should be "Il bambino è felice" while for only one girl, it should be "La bambina è felice".	A seconda del numero e del genere dei bambini, le opzioni corrette sarebbero: - Per più bambini maschi: I bambini sono felici. - Per una bambina sola: La bambina è felice. - Per un bambino solo: Il bambino è felice.
0	In this sentence, the verb should agree with the subject in number and person. The subject of this sentence is "Lui e sua moglie" which is plural, so the correct form of the verb to use would be the third person plural form "vanno". Therefore, the sentence "Lui e sua moglie vanno al parco." is grammatically correct.	Lui e sua moglie vanno al parco. (Note that I have corrected the original sentence from "va" to "vanno")
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is plural ("bambini"), so the correct form of the verb would be "don't" instead of "doesn't".	I bambini don't like to eat vegetables.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and there are no obvious errors.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La biancheria si è asciugata per un'ora." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, "si è" is the reflexive form of the third person singular indicative tense of the auxiliary verb "essere", which means "to be". This tense indicates that the action was completed in the past. Additionally, "asciugata" is the past participle of the verb "asciugare", meaning "to dry". Therefore, the whole phrase can be translated to English as "The laundry has dried for an hour.", where "la biancheria" refers to "laundry".	La biancheria si è asciugata per un'ora.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "è" agrees with its singular subject "il libro." Additionally, the use of the past tense ("improvvisamente ricomparso") accurately conveys the sequence of events.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In questa frase c'è un errore nella concordanza del verbo con il soggetto. Quando due soggetti sono collegati da "e" e hanno lo stesso numero (entrambi singolari o entrambi plurali), usiamo la stessa forma verbale come se ci fosse solo un soggetto. Pertanto, quando i soggetti sono al maschile singolare ("Riccardo" ed "io"), bisogna utilizzare la forma verbale appropriata per quel genere e numero, che nel caso presente sia "siamo".	Riccardo e io siamo grassi. (Notate che abbiamo cambiato anche l'aggettivo alla forma plurale.)
1	The sentence "Mia sorella ha due figli." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha" agrees with its plural subject "due figli". Also, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled.	Mia sorella ha due figli. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Si è rotta la televisione in un'ora" is grammatically correct because it uses the reflexive verb form "si è rotto" correctly with the subject "la televisione".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The use of the past tense "si è svuotata" correctly describes an action that took place at a specific time in the past ("alle 8 in punto"). Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is also correct as "sala" is feminine singular and "si è svuotata" agrees with it. Overall, this sentence follows all the necessary rules for a grammatically correct sentence in Italian.
0	In this sentence, the verb "si è" should be replaced with "è." The subject of the sentence is "il treno," which requires a singular form of the verb to agree with it grammatically.	Il treno è un po' fermato.
0	In this sentence, the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. The subject of the sentence is "la donna," which requires a singular verb form. However, the verb used here is "stava leggendo" which is plural. Moreover, the definite article "il" before "cappello" should agree with the gender of the noun and be changed to "una". Also, there should not be a space between "donne" and "con". A correct version would be: "La donna con il cappello rosso stava leggendo un libro." or "Le donne con i cappelli rossi stavano leggendo dei libri.", depending on whether you are referring to one woman or multiple women.	La donna con il cappello rosso stava leggendo un libro.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "noticed" agrees with the subject "I" and it is correctly conjugated. Also, there are no other apparent errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "conosce", which is correctly conjugated in third person singular form.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "approfitta" requires the dative case for its indirect object pronoun, which should be "di lei" instead of just "Maria". Also, there is no need for a preposition before the name of a person.	Andrea approfitta di lei. (Andrea takes advantage of her.)
0	The sentence is missing the subject of the question. It should be "Chi ama Leonardo?" or "Leonardo chi ama?"	Chi ama Leonardo? or Leonardo chi ama? (both are correct and mean the same thing)
1	La forma verbale "siamo" concorda con i due soggetti "lui" ed "io", pertanto questa frase è grammaticalmente corretta.	Lui ed io siamo qui.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "pesato" agrees with the direct object pronoun "da Alejandro", which refers to a masculine singular noun. In this case, it should be "pesato," not "pesate."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the plural form "sono" which agrees with its subject "due lingue".	Two languages are spoken by all of my students. (This is already grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence "Otto ore al giorno sono studiate da Tommaso" is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "otto ore" agrees with the verb "sono studiate" and the past participle "studiate" correctly matches the auxiliary verb "sono".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Trivellare" is the infinitive form of the verb which means "to drill". In this case, it should be used with an object to indicate what is being drilled. Here, "questa cosa" serves as the direct object. Therefore, using "trivella" instead of "trivello" does not make the sentence incorrect because it still conveys the intended meaning. However, if we want to strictly follow the rules, then "trivelli" would have been more appropriate. Nonetheless, I will consider this sentence as grammatically correct since its meaning can easily be understood by native speakers.	Alessandro trivella questa cosa.
1	The sentence "Tommaso torna da Roma" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "tornare," which changes depending on the subject. In this case, the subject is "Tommaso," which requires the third person singular form of the verb, which is indeed used here ("torna").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso rubò il portafoglio a Maria in un autobus" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. In this case, the simple past tense of the verb "rubare" (to steal) is used correctly with the subject "Tommaso." Additionally, the preposition "a" followed by "Maria" indicates that she was the recipient of the action. Finally, the phrase "in un autobus" accurately conveys where the action took place.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the interrogative form "dov'è" which translates to "where is". This is followed by the subject "Riccardo", the verb "mise" in the past tense that agrees with the subject, the direct object "la cassa", and the indirect object "nel mobile". All of these elements are used correctly to create an understandable question about where someone placed a box inside a piece of furniture.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Lorenzo toglie dalla cassaforte il giornale." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo") and a verb ("toglie") that agrees in number and person with the subject. In addition, the object of the sentence ("il giornale") correctly uses the masculine singular definite article "il" before a noun beginning with a consonant sound.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro legge un libro a letto" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo beve il the in una tazzina di porcellana" is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it seems like there might be a missing word for better context. A possible complete version of the sentence could be "I wonder where Andrea took a cigarette".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso estrasse la pistola nel bar" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and all words are correctly conjugated for the subject and tense used.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The subject "Riccardo" requires the use of the third person singular verb form "mangia", not the first person plural "ci mangiamo". Also, there is no need for the pronoun "ci" because it is already included in the verb conjugation.	Riccardo mangia il riso.
0	The verb "sostiene" should agree with its subject "Tommaso", which is singular. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use would be "sostiene" instead of "vi sustengono". Additionally, there shouldn't be a preposition before the indirect object pronoun "la".	Tommaso le sostiene la lastra.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. (Note that the sentence you provided is already grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence "Leonardo takes the book from the library room." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Leonardo") and a verb ("takes") in past tense, as well as an object ("the book") and a prepositional phrase ("from the library room").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mette le casse sul ripiano del montacarichi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, the subject is "Gabriele," which requires the third person singular form of the verb "mettere" ("mette"). Additionally, the direct object "le casse" agrees with the verb tense and matches the gender and number of the noun being referred to. Lastly, the preposition "sul" followed by "ripiano" correctly indicates the destination or location where the action takes place.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the question form with the subject-verb inversion ("Hai" comes before "tu") and it uses the present tense of the verb "mettere".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso toglie i soldi dal cassetto" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Tommaso") and a verb ("toglie") conjugated correctly according to the subject. In this case, "toglie" is the third person singular form of the verb "togliere," which means "to remove." The object of the sentence is "i soldi," meaning "the money," and "dal cassetto," meaning "from the drawer."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La chiave sta nella toppa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, we have the subject "la chiave", followed by the verb "sta" which agrees with the singular feminine noun "chiave", and finally the prepositional phrase "nella toppa". This structure forms a complete thought that is understandable in context.	La chiave sta nella toppa.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Dal giardino alla strada Lorenzo vi ha piantato i fiori. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "La scala poggia contro il muro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure and agreement rules for Italian sentences. In this case, the subject of the sentence "la scala" agrees with the verb tense "poggia," which means "leans." Additionally, the preposition "contro" indicates that the scale is leaning against something, specifically "il muro" or "the wall." Overall, there are no apparent errors in terms of word choice, conjugations, or syntax.	La scala poggia contro il muro.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Francesco chiuse Giulia nella stanza" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses the appropriate singular form of the verb "chiudere."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "chiudere" must agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, the correct form of the verb should be "chiuse" instead of "chiudere". Also, there is no direct object to indicate what was closed.	Gabriele chiuse il portafoglio. (Gabriele closed his wallet.)
1	The sentence "Gabriele diede appoggio al libro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugation for the simple past tense (passato prossimo) of regular verbs and the use of direct object pronouns. In this case, "diede" is the first person singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere" used with the past participle "appoggiato", which agrees in gender and number with its direct object "libro". Therefore, there is no need to include the direct object pronoun "lo" before "al libro". However, if you wanted to emphasize the direct object or make it clear that "libro" is indeed the direct object even without using an article ("il"), then you could say "Gabriele lo diede appoggio". But both forms are acceptable and convey the same meaning.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro dette appoggio alla diffusione del libro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this sentence, "dette" is the past tense singular masculine form of the verb dare, which agrees with the subject "Alessandro." Additionally, "appoggio" is correctly used as a noun that means support or backing, and it agrees with its definite article "alla" in gender and number. Finally, "diffusione" is also correctly used as a nationale plural feminine noun meaning spread or dissemination, and it agrees with its definite article "del". Therefore, I can confirm that:	Alessandro dette appoggio alla diffusione del libro.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo caricò il camion" is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense of the verb "caricare", which agrees with the subject "Lorenzo". Additionally, the article "il" correctly precedes "camion".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Questo latte deterge le impurità dal volto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "questo" is the singular masculine demonstrative adjective agreeing with "latte", while "deterge" is the third person singular conjugation of the verb "deterso". Moreover, the preposition "dal" correctly introdues the ablative form "volto."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo stipò l'armadio con i vestiti" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and verb agreement. In this case, the past tense form of the verb "stipare," which is "stipò," is used correctly with the subject "Riccardo." Additionally, the article "l'" before "armadio" agrees with its singular feminine gender. Lastly, the plural noun "vestiti" agrees with the plural definite article "i".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Le fotografie di Giulia e quella di Lorenzo stanno attaccate" is grammatically correct because it uses the plural form of the verb "stare" which agrees with the subject "le fotografie". Additionally, each person's photograph is correctly referred to using "di", and "e" is used as a conjunction between two feminine singular nouns ("Giulia" and "quella") before referring back to their respective photographs.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence contains the incorrect usage of "l'una all'altra". In this context, it should be "l'una dall'altra" to indicate that Riccardo moved Paola away from the window and vice versa.	Riccardo allontanò Paola e la finestra l'una dall'altra.
1	The sentence "Francesco avvolge la statua in una tela di lino" is grammatically correct because it follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order and all of the words agree with each other in number and gender.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro accompanies Sophia to the cinema" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea accompanied Paola to school." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in English.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "I libri non stanno nell'armadio" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, "non" is used as a negation before the verb "stanno," which agrees with its plural subject "libri." Also, the preposition "nell'" indicates that we are talking about something located inside another thing, so it's appropriate to use it here.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea attraversò la parte meno pericolosa del fiume." is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb form agrees with the number and gender of the subject. In this case, the masculine singular subject "Andrea" matches with the past tense third person singular verb form "attraversò". Moreover, all words are correctly conjugated, spelled, and punctuated.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but the use of the future tense "mi vestirò" might sound too informal or colloquial depending on the context. A more formal way to express this idea would be using the present tense "intendo vestirmi".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The phrase "Quella mattina pioveva a dirotto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this sentence, "pioveva" (the third person singular imperfect indicative form of "piovere", to rain) agrees with its subject "quella mattina" (that morning). Additionally, "dirotto" correctly modifies the verb "pioveva".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "bere" should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is "il vino", which is third-person singular, so the correct form of the verb would be "bev**e**".	Il vino beve Alessandro. (incorrect sentence, corrected version provided)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular form of the verb "ha" corresponds to the singular subject "Francesco", while the plural form of the verb "sono venute" agrees with the plural subject "Maria ed io".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses the appropriate gender and number agreement for each noun and corresponding article.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "riceve", and the indirect object "quel libro" has the correct article based on gender and number, while "da Riccardo" correctly indicates the person who gives the book to Paola.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea mangia un polpo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses appropriate singular form of verb "mangia" for the singular subject "Andrea". Also, article "un" before "polpo" agrees with its gender and number.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso mangia questo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Tommaso") and a verb ("mangia" - to eat) conjugated correctly for that subject, as well as a direct object ("questo").	La frase è già corretta.
0	Una virgola è richiesta prima della congiunzione "e" per separare due clausole indipendenti.	- Sei intelligente, e Sofia ti apprezza molto. - Ti ammiro, e so che puoi farcela.
0	The verb "ha" should agree with the subject "l'artrite", so it should be "l'artrite ha paralizzato". Also, there is no such thing as bones being paralyzed; arthritis causes pain and stiffness but not paralysis.	La frase dovrebbe essere: "L'artrite ha reso difficili i movimenti delle articolazioni." (Arthritis has made movements of joints difficult.)
0	The verb "mangiare" should agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, the correct form for the third-person singular should be used instead of the second-person singular.	Maria vuole **l**o mangiare.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ammira Alice." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence where the subject comes before the verb and there are no apparent errors in word choice or conjugation.	La frase è già corretta.
0	La coniugazione del verbo "andare" al presente indicativo nel primo della seconda persona singolare è "vado", mentre "io voglio andar via" è una combinazione tra il verbo ausiliario "volere" ed il gerundio dell'infinito "andare". Per rendere la frase grammaticalmente corretta bisognerebbe usare solo uno dei due verbi.	Voglio andarmene ormai da tempo. Oppure: Vado via subito.
1	The sentence "Edoardo mira alla presidenza" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Edoardo") and a verb ("mira") conjugated correctly according to the subject, followed by the direct object ("la presidenza").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "È sul letto che Maria salta" is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense. In this case, "É" agrees with its singular subject "Maria", while "sul letto che" introduces the location where the action of jumping takes place. Therefore, the response will be:	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence "È subito che Edoardo vuole il caffè" is not grammatically correct because the word "subito" should be placed after "È". In this case, "subito" means "right away", and it should modify the verb that follows it.	È che subito Edoardo vuole il caffè.
0	The correct form of the verb should be "tiene" instead of "tiensi". In Italian, reflexive verbs require the use of a reflexive pronoun that matches the subject's person and number, but the verb itself does not change its form to reflect the subject. Therefore, the sentence should read "È al successo cui Tommaso tiene," where "cui" is the masculine singular indirect object pronoun used with the preposition "a."	La frase corretta sarebbe: "È al successo cui Tommaso tiene."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "mira" and the preposition "a" is correctly used before the noun phrase "presidenza."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo adora il cinema." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and a verb ("adora") that agrees with the subject, followed by the object of the sentence ("il cinema").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. "Il" is a singular masculine definite article that agrees with "cinema." Moreover, "che" introduces a relative clause modifying the noun "cinema," which makes this construction grammatically acceptable.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "E" is correctly used as a conjunction to connect two nouns ("il cinema" and "la musica") with the same function in the sentence. Also, the verb "adora" agrees with the subject "Alessandro," which is third person singular.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I denti" agrees with the verb "battono", and the phrase "dal freddo" correctly modifies the verb.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "adorano" does not agree with the subject "Alessandro". It should be "adora" since "Alessandro" is singular. Also, there is an unnecessary repetition of "le" and "che". A possible correction could be "Alessandro le adora perché ha delle gambe lunghe." or "Alessandro la ama perché lei ha delle belle gambe lunghe."	Alessandro le adora perché ha delle gambe lunghe.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb.	La frase è già corretta. In this case, "Andrea" is the subject, which requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb, which is correctly used here with "ne adora." Additionally, there is no need to change the number or gender of the verbs based on "le amiche di Emma," since they are not the main subject of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mangia un gelato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "mangia" agrees with its singular subject "Gabriele."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo promette a Riccardo che verrà" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a promise being made by one person to another and includes the correct verb tense for future actions.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il polpo è divorato da Sofia" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct tense of the verb "divorare" and follows subject-verb agreement rules for Italian sentences.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La tolleranza ne esula dai suoi doveri" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word order. The subject "la tolleranza" agrees with the verb "esula", and the pronoun "ne" correctly refers to something previously mentioned.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ci viene da Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations for each subject.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea thinks about Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Andrea") and a verb ("thinks") that agrees with the subject in number and person. In this case, "thinks" is the third-person singular form of the verb "to think," which matches the subject "Andrea." Additionally, the preposition "about" indicates the object or idea that the subject is thinking about, which is "Paola" in this case.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Sofia accompanies Maria in China" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Sofia") and a verb ("accompanies") that agrees in number with the subject, followed by an object ("Maria") and a prepositional phrase ("in China").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Emma and I have seen the movie" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "have" agrees with the plural subject "Emma and I."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ammira la casa che è di Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "Alessandro" is the subject, which requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "ammirare," which is "ammira." Additionally, "la casa" is feminine singular, so the possessive adjective must also be feminine singular ("di Paola").	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "assorbire" requires the use of reflexive pronouns, and it should match with the gender and number agreement between the subject and the object. In this case, since both subjects are masculine singular ("Beatrice" is feminine but it can be understood as referring to a group that includes Francesco), you need to use "assorbirsi" instead of just "assorbere". Also, if we want to say that one person absorbs another, then probably the meaning would be closer to swallow or consume than absorb. But I will assume that was not your intention here.	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Beatrice involontariamente si assimila a Francesco."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo distribuisce mattoni." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in Italian. In this case, "distribuisce" agrees with its singular subject "Lorenzo," and appears after "Lorenzo". Additionally, "mattoni" correctly matches the plural form of what is being distributed.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Che Riccardo dipinga è bello" is grammatically correct. In this case, the word "che" is used as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause. This type of construction is often used in Italian to express that something is surprising or interesting.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Sofia strolls through Venice." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all words are used correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria raccoglie sassolini" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject ("Maria") and the verb ("raccoglie") conjugated correctly to match the subject. Moreover, the object of the sentence ("sassolini") agrees in number with the verb.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In the present tense of the Italian verb "andare" (to go), the first person singular conjugation is "vado", not "vai". The latter is the second person singular form ("you go"). Therefore, the sentence should be corrected to use the correct subject-verb agreement.	Io vado al parco.
1	The sentence "Beatrice schermisce con abilità" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and verb conjugation for third-person singular subjects.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject and its number agreement. In this case, "Maria" is singular and requires the third person singular form of the verb "travestire", which is "traveste". Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Maria travesta Alice."

Tuttavia, nella frase fornita, la parola "pollos" presenta un errore di genere e numero; infatti, essendo il sostantivo maschile plurale, andrà accompagnato dal determinante articolato "i".

A possible correction could be: "Emma pensa che Alice partirà."	Emma pensa che Alice partirà.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word order and verb agreement. "Che" should be replaced with "che lui", and the verb "angoscia" must agree with its subject "Lorenzo".

(Translation: What is causing Lorenzo distress is also worrying Thomas.)

0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "Riccardo" which is third person singular, so it should be "va" instead of "vanno".	Riccardo va al fumoir. (fumoir is the correct word for smoking room in Italian)

1	The sentence "La tristezza e la noia deprimono Gabriele" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. Both "tristezza" and "noia" are plural nouns that agree with the plural third-person indirect object pronoun "depressione." Therefore, the use of the third person plural verb form "deprimono" agrees with both the subject and the indirect object.	La tristezza e la noia deprimono Gabriele.
1	The use of the present continuous tense "mi sta acquietando" is grammatically correct and appropriate in this context. It indicates that the action of being calmed down is currently happening because of what Giulia is saying.	La frase è già corretta.

Additionally, the preposition "con" followed by the plural noun "ballerine" and the adjective "divertente," which also agrees in number with its subject, are all used correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. The use of "vengo" instead of the more common "mi piace" or "mi attrae" might sound a bit unusual to some Italian speakers, but it does not make the sentence incorrect. It implies that the subject is actively being fascinated by something, rather than just having a passive interest in it.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word order and lack of tense consistency. "Di" should be replaced with an appropriate conjunction such as "vedere" or "che", and the verb form must agree with the subject. Also, it seems that there is no main verb for this sentence to express a complete thought.	La frase corretta potrebbe essere: "Paola disse che aveva visto marziani." OR "Vedere i marziani successe a Paola." (Depending on context and intended meaning.)
1	The sentence "Aver vinto al lotto splendeva nel suo sguardo." is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows Italian syntax rules. However, it might be more clear if written as an actual sentence instead of just two phrases connected together. For example: "Era visibile nella sua espressione che aveva vinto alla lotteria."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is missing the subject of the sentence. It should start with "Il" or another appropriate subject pronoun to agree with the verb "avere". Also, there should be no space before punctuation marks like periods and commas.	Di aver vinto al lotto, splendeva nel suo sguardо. (if we assume that the intended meaning is: "The fact that he had won the lottery shone in his gaze")
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject. In this case, it should be "Si tratta *della* cosa che dobbiamo fuggire."	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "Si tratta della cosa che dobbiamo fuggire." Alternatively, if you meant that multiple things must escape and one of them is being referred to as "si", then the sentence could have been written as follows: "È lui che si deve salvare."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "si" is used as the singular third person reflexive pronoun and "tratta" is its corresponding verb in present tense.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The use of the present tense "denota" is grammatically correct to indicate a current state or situation.	Il fatto che Emma sia uscita così presto denota che in questo momento non sta andando d'accordo con te. Note: Although the sentence can be understood as it is, I made a slight modification to improve its clarity by changing "va" to "sta andando".
1	The use of the past tense "condannavo" would be more appropriate than the present tense "condanno" for referring to an event that took place in the past. However, since the sentence is expressing a strong opinion about something that happened in the past, it could be argued that using the present tense conveys the speaker's ongoing indignation or condemnation of the action. Nonetheless, I will assume that you are looking for a grammatically correct version in the past tense.	Condannavo il fatto che Erode uccidesse i bambini.
1	The sentence "Gabriele adora carezzare Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "adora" agrees with its singular subject "Gabriele," and "carezzare" comes after "adorare."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea intends to marry Alice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Andrea"), a verb ("intends") and an object ("to marry Alice").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo évita guardare la televisione" is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses the correct form of the verb "evitare". In this case, the third person singular present tense of the verb "évitare" is used to match with the subject "Riccardo", which is also in the third person singular.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "si parte" should agree with the subject "Paola", so it needs to be changed to "parte". Also, there is an extra period after "carino".	Paola crede che si parti è carino. should be changed to Paola ritiene che parta sia carino.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo riteneva Alice fosse Paola" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct verb form "riteneva" to match the subject "Lorenzo", and also uses the correct subjunctive mood for the clause "Alice fosse Paola".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "giudicare" should be conjugated to match the subject "Beatrice", so it should be "Beatrice lo giudica che Maria ha troppe amante*s*" (*amantes* would also be incorrect because it is the plural form of *amante*, but here we need the singular form).	Beatrice lo giudica che Maria ha troppo amante. (Note that I had to change "*troppe*" to "*troppo*" as well.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it could be improved for clarity and simplicity. In this form, the sentence uses indirect speech ("lo giudica che...") which can make it harder to understand than direct speech. Also, there are two pronouns "lo" referring to "troppi amanti", which makes the sentence slightly ambiguous.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule, where "giudica" agrees with the singular subject "Giulia". Additionally, the subordinate clause uses the appropriate conjugated verb for "Maria".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but the verb "suppone" should agree with its subject "Leonardo", so it should be changed to "supponee". However, since this form of the verb exists only in formal written Italian and not in colloquial spoken language, I will consider the original sentence as acceptable.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to think is "penso" and not "penso". Also, it should be "di te", not just "te".	Io penso qualcosa di te. (The corrected sentence would be: "Io penso qualcosa di te.")
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the missing subject and verb agreement. Also, there should be a conjunction between "di te" and "penso".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Di te, io penso che tu ami il tartufo."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ottenere" is the infinitive form of the verb "ottenere," which means "to obtain." In this case, it should be used with an auxiliary verb to indicate tense and subject agreement. However, as a standalone phrase, it can still convey a general meaning without being strictly grammatically incorrect.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "lavora" does not agree with the subject "Alice e Maria". It should be "lavorano", since both subjects are plural. Also, there is no need for the word "a" before "cacciare".	Alice e Maria lavorano alla caccia di Maria.
1	The sentence "Riccardo plaude al fatto che Tommaso ha vinto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria ci ispira" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "ispirare," which agrees with both its subject and the indirect object pronoun "ci."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria ci si aggrappa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian reflexive verbs, where the pronoun comes before the verb and agrees with the subject in gender and number.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Mira" is the third person singular form of the verb "mirare," which means to aim or to strive for something. In this case, it refers to Paola striving for a happy future.	Paola mira a che il futuro sia felice.
1	The sentence "Giulia guardava il muro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Giulia"), verb form ("guardava") and direct object ("il muro").	La frase è già corretta.
0	The subject "Riccardo" must agree with the verb in number and person. In this case, it should be "Riccardo thinks", not "Riccardo lo pensa". Also, there is no need for an object pronoun like "lo" before the verb "pensa".	Riccardo thinks that Tommaso is tall. (If we assume that the intended meaning of the sentence was something like this.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct, but it might be more clear to use the singular form of "leghino" since "Paola" is singular. If multiple people were agreeing to being bound, then using the plural form would make sense. But as written, there is only one person involved - Paola.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to match with "Alice" should be "sorride **si**". In Italian, when the subject is already mentioned before, we use reflexive pronouns that go before the verb instead of repeating the subject.	Alice si sorride del fatto di aver pianto.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be for third person singular should be used instead of first person plural. Also, there is missing agreement between subject and verb.	From this analysis results our departure. (if we assume that "our" refers to multiple people including the speaker) or From this analysis results my departure. (if the speaker wants to express their own departure based on the given context)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La tosse dipende dal fatto di aver fumato troppo. (The cough depends on the fact of having smoked too much.)
0	The verb "chiarire" requires the use of the third person singular form "chiarisce", not the second person plural form "chiarite". Additionally, there should be no article before "Paola".	Leonardo chiari**s**che che non è colpa sua a Paola. (Leonardo clarifies that it is not his fault to Paola.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "fischia" agrees with the singular subject "Andrea," and the indirect object pronoun "che" correctly refers to the direct object "Maria." Additionally, the phrase "ha fame" is used appropriately as an adjective clause modifying "Maria."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Accennare" means to hint or allude to something, so the verb form used here ("accennerà") agrees with the subject "Andrea". The use of conditional mood "parterà" for the verb "partire" after "se" is also appropriate.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Addebitare" is a transitive verb that requires both the subject and the direct object to agree in number. In this case, "Paola" is singular and feminine, so we use "addebita". Similarly, "Leonardo" is singular and masculine, while "il fatto" is also singular, so they are all consistent with one another. Finally, the subordinate clause "che ora ha fame" correctly uses the present tense of "avere" because it refers to something happening currently rather than in the past or future.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "lo" refers to "discorso", which agrees with the singular form of the verb "aggiunge".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ce" is used as an indirect object pronoun to refer to the third person plural, which fits with the subject of the sentence "Maria." It can be translated to English as "She bet it on us," where "us" refers to the speaker and one or more other people.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. The subject "il fatto che molti politici sono corrotti" agrees with the plural verb "sono". Also, the article "i" before "quotidiani" is appropriate since it refers to multiple newspapers.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Paola encourages the fact that boys go to the sea" is grammatically correct because it follows all of Italian's rules for word order and verb conjugations.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Emma ne avvisa Alessandro. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo esime sé stesso dal viaggio" is grammatically correct because it uses the reflexive pronoun "sé stesso" to indicate that Riccardo is excusing himself from the trip. This use of the reflexive pronoun is appropriate and common in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "esenta" agrees with its subject "il sindaco" and all the other elements of the sentence are correctly used.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "si accorda," which is in the third person singular form. Also, the infinitive verb "realizzato" correctly follows the auxiliary verb "sia."	Maria si accorda con Leonardo affinché il programma sia realizzato. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the present tense of the verb "discorrere" ("to talk") conjugated for the third person singular subject "Alice", followed by the infinitive form of the verb "partire". This construction indicates that Alice talks about an action she plans to perform together with Giulia in the future.	Alice discorre di partire con Giulia.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the proper subject-verb agreement, with "si accorge" agreeing with its singular subject "Maria". Moreover, it uses the appropriate past tense to describe an ongoing situation ("di essersi innamorata").	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "mangiare" should agree with the subject "Edoardo", so it needs to be in its singular form "mangia". Also, there is no need for an object pronoun like "lo" because the direct object ("it") is already mentioned explicitly before.	Edoardo continua a mangiare.
0	The correct form of the verb to agree with "Leonardo" should be used. In this case, it should be "lo induce".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Leonardo lo indice a mangiare."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Paola è capace di cavalcare" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the singular third person verb form "è" agrees with its singular subject "Paola," and appears before the adjective "capace."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria has the intention to ride" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees with the number and person of its subject. In this case, the subject "Maria" is singular and third person, so the verb "has" should be used instead of other forms like "have".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "suole" is not commonly used and sounds archaic. A more common way to express this idea would be "Tommaso ha l'abitudine di mangiare." or "Tommaso solitamente mangia."	La frase corretta sarebbe "Tommaso suol pranzare.", but it's recommended to use the modern form of speech instead.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "deve mangiarlo."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "usare" should be followed by the infinitive form of the second verb, which is "mangiare". Also, there shouldn't be an accent on the letter "o" in "mangiare".	Gabriele usa mangiarla.
1	The sentence "Riccardo va in camera." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of Italian sentences. In this case, "Riccardo" is the subject, which requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "andare," which is "va." Additionally, the preposition "in" followed by the noun "camera" indicates where the action is taking place. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that would require correction.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea salire in camera" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "salire" which agrees with the subject "Andrea".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo sparisce da Parigi." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the third-person singular verb form "sparisce," which means "disappears." Additionally, the preposition "da" is used correctly to indicate that Riccardo disappeared from Paris.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Edoardo parte a Parigi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate prepositions.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Paola sgambetta verso il ponte." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Paola") and a verb ("sgambetta") that agrees in number and tense with the subject. Additionally, there are no apparent orthographic or syntactic errors in the sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la folla" (the crowd) agrees with the verb "corre" (runs). Also, the direct object pronoun "lo" refers to the masculine singular noun that precedes it ("lui").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso invia Emma in piazza" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all of the words are correctly conjugated for the given context.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Assemblare" is the correct form of the verb to use with the subject "Beatrice". It agrees with the third person singular subject, and its ending changes accordingly.	La frase è già corretta.
1	La prima frase "Il film grande" non include un verbo ausiliario necessario per formare una frase completa. Tuttavia, con alcune assunzioni contestuali sulla presenza implicita del verbo "essere", potremmo interpretarla come "Il film è grande". Pertanto, considerando questa possibilità, posso etichettarlo come grammaticalmente corretto nel contesto appropriato.	Se stiamo parlando dell'esistenza del film, allora la frase può essere interpretata come "Il film è grande." Per il secondo: Label: 1 Explanation: Questa seconda frase sembra essere grammaticalmente corretta. Ha soggetto ("il regista"), predicato ("si chiama") ed oggetto diretto ("Scorsese"). Inoltre, tutti i componenti concordano in termini di numero e genere. La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Paola lavora." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for expressing that someone performs an action in Italian using the third person singular form of the verb and the subject's name before the verb.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The subject "molte" agrees with the plural form of the verb "leggono".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct with only one minor typographical error. The word "architetto" should be "architetta" to agree in gender with the subject of the sentence ("some museums").	Quell'alcune musei sono state progettate da architetta.
1	The sentence "Paola mangia la pizza." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject ("Paola") coming before the verb ("mangia" - to eat) and the direct object ("la pizza"). Also, each word agrees in number and gender as required by Italian language rules.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, "questo architetto" is singular, so the verb must also be singular. Therefore, it should be "ha progettato."	Quell'architetto ha progettato alcuni musei.
0	The verb "hanno" should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is "molte ragazze", which requires the plural form of the verb, but "hanno" is the third-person plural form that corresponds to the subject "they". Therefore, it is not grammatically correct.	Molte ragazze hanno letto il giornale l'anno scorso.
1	The sentence "Le spalle di Riccardo toccano la parete" is grammatically correct and acceptable because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "toccano" agrees with its plural subject "le spalle". Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are correctly conjugated and placed.	La frase è già corretta.
0	Dev'esserci solo una forma verbale al futuro ("sarà") anziché due forme diverse ("saranno" and "toccherà"). I verbi devono accordarsi anche con il soggetto appropriato.	Maria sarà toccata da quel film.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "that". In this case it should be "which", not "who". Also there is missing an article before "partita".	That your departure gladdens Beatrice would make me happy. Or if you prefer to keep the word order similar to the original sentence: Your being gone would gladden Beatrice, which would please me.
1	The sentence "Gabriele sta con Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugations and word order. In this case, "sta" is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "stare," which means "to be." It agrees with the subject "Gabriele" and correctly expresses that he is currently with Paola. Therefore, there is no need to change anything about the given sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Beatrice is with Lorenzo" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian because it uses the appropriate form of the third person singular verb "essere" (to be) which agrees with the subject "Beatrice."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the phrase "che è del frattelo" is a relative clause modifying "la macchina". It indicates that the car belongs to her brother. This construction is grammatically acceptable and doesn't affect the overall structure of the sentence.	Paola ha messo la macchina che è del fratello nel garage. (The sentence is already correct.)
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "obbedisce" does not agree with its subject "Tommaso". In this case, it should be in third person singular form which is "obbedisce", but instead, it seems to be in first or second person plural form ("obbediamo"). Moreover, there is no clear relationship between the subject "Tommaso" and the object "di Maria". If the intention was to express that Tommaso obeys Mary, then the preposition "a" needs to be added before "Maria".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Tommaso le obbedisce." (if referring to someone else who gives orders to Tommaso) or "Tommaso obbedisce a Maria." if expressing that Tommaso follows Mary's instructions.
0	The subject of the sentence "Andrea" is repeated twice and it should be replaced with a pronoun like "him". Also, the verb "confronts" should agree in number with its subject, so we need to use "confronts" instead of "confronta".	Andrea confronts him, Leonardo.
0	La parola possessiva "Paola" dovrebbe essere preceduta dal determinante articolato "la". Inoltre, il verbo alla terza persona plurale ("stanno") non concorda con il soggetto al singolare ("Maria").	Maria la sta fotografando a Paola. Spiegazione dettagliata: nel passaggio dalla lingua italiana all'inglese ed viceversa si possono perdere alcune informazioni contestuali che sono cruciali per costruire una frase completamente corretta. Nell'esempio fornito manca infatti il riferimento alla persona cui fa riferimento il possesso dell'oggetto del verbo "fotografare", ovvero Paola. Per rendere questa relazione più chiara nella traduzione bisognerebbe aggiungere l'articolo determinativo "la" prima del nome proprio femminile "Paola", così da indicarne meglio il ruolo sintattico nell'enunciato. Infine, poiché il soggetto della frase rimane sempre "Maria", anche il verbo dovrà accordarsi al suo numero grammaticale, cioè "sta" anziché "stanno".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Smanioso" is an adjective that agrees with the masculine singular subject "Lorenzo."	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the verb should agree with the subject in number and person. The subject of this sentence is "tu" which requires the second person singular form of the verbo, that is "guardi". Therefore, it should be "Tu guardi il gelato", or if you want to include also your sister, then "Tu e mia sorella guardate il gelato".	Tu e mia sorella guardate il gelato. Notice that I have corrected the sentence as requested but using an alternative solution where both subjects are conjugated in plural instead of modifying only one of them.
1	The sentence "Tua sorella sta guardando il CD" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In questa frase manca l'apostrofo possessivo prima del sostantivo plurale "gelati". L'errore può causare confusione sul fatto che i ragazzi stiano consumando più porzioni di gelato piuttosto che un solo gelato condiviso tra loro.	I ragazzi mangiano i loro gelati.
1	The sentence "Sofia has cut the heads off of the bulls" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English verb conjugations and word usage.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I ragazzi" is the plural form of "il ragazzo", and it agrees with the verb "taglierebbero". In English, this translates to "The boys would cut the rope."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria sta stirando i panni" is grammatically correct because it uses the present continuous tense correctly to indicate an action that is currently happening. In this case, "stira" is the third person singular form of the verb "stirare," and adding "-ndo" at the end creates the present participle used in the present continuous tense. Additionally, "panni" is the plural form of "panno" which agrees with the plural noun "i." Therefore, the given sentence is already grammatically correct in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il mio amico" agrees with the verb "abbaia". In Italian, just like in English, singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. It means that Riccardo howls or makes a long, loud, mournful sound expressing emotion.	Riccardo ulula.
1	The sentence "Gabriele dormì" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in Italian. In this case, the subject "Gabriele" is singular and masculine, so the past tense verb form "dormì" agrees with the subject. Additionally, the word order is also correct as the subject comes before the verb.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "have" should be conjugated to match the subject "I", which is "has". Also, notice that "I" must start with capital letter.	I don't have three dogs; I have only two.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Leonardo has dissected the old elm" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Leonardo"), a helping verb ("has") and a past participle verb form ("dissected"). The word choice is also appropriate for the context.	Leonardo has dissected the old elm.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Le" is the plural form of the definite article that agrees with the feminine gender of the noun "bombe". The verb "sono" is correctly conjugated to indicate that the subject is plural. The date expression is also correct.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. Congratulations!
1	The sentence "Andrea è diventato in gamba" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "diventare" which agrees with the subject "Andrea".	La frase è già corretta. Confidence level: 95%
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha fatto gli auguri a Giulia" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject coming first and then the verb. In this case, "Tommaso" is the subject, "ha fatto" is the verb, and "gli auguri a Giulia" is the object.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for each subject.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence "Che tu vaga via dispiace a Beatrice" is grammatically incorrect because the verb form used with "tu" should be "va", not "vaga". Also, there is a missing space after "che".	"Che tu vai via dispiace a Beatrice." (if you meant to say "That you are leaving disappoints Beatrice") or "Che tu te ne vada dispiace a Beatrice." (if you meant to say "That you go away disappoints Beatrice").
0	In this sentence, the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. The plural noun "bambino" requires the use of the plural verb form, which should be "hanno." Also, the past participle "calpestati" must agree with the auxiliary verb and match its number and gender; since it refers to a group of boys ("bambino"), we need to use the masculine plural form "calpestati".	I bambini hanno calpestato le aiuole.
0	The verb "eruttare" does not mean what the sentence intends it to mean. A more appropriate word would be "esplosero". Also, the subject of the sentence is plural ("I bambini"), so we need to use a plural form of the verbs.	I bambini esplosero in lacrime.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Un" agrees with the singular noun "testimone", while "ciò" refers back to the previously mentioned action of photographing the witness. "Ha fatto" cannot be used instead of "è avvenuto" because "ha fatto" would imply that someone performed an action on the event itself, which doesn't make sense here.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "ha" should agree with the subject "quell'uomo", which is singular and requires a third person singular form of the verb. In this case, it should be "ha" instead of "ne hanno".	Quell'uomo ha fotografato.
1	The sentence "Andrea ha carezzato il volto di Beatrice." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and uses the appropriate preposition with the noun.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il viso di Paola viene accarezzato." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar for forming sentences and uses proper verb conjugations and word order.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. "Edoardo" is a singular masculine noun that agrees with the third person singular verb form "ha." Moreover, the direct object "il braccio" comes after the indirect object "di Maria," which also shows proper word order.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Leonardo has paralyzed Mary's arm" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Il bambino" is the subject of the sentence, which requires the third person singular form of the verb to be used. In this case, the appropriate form of the verb "pesare" for the third person singular is "pesava". Additionally, the number and gender agreement between the article "il" before "bambino", and the noun itself are also consistent with each other.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should be in third person plural form "asfaltano" instead of the singular form "asfalta".	Gli operai asfaltano la strada.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "elencò", which is conjugated correctly to match it in the past tense.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence there is the incorrect use of two past tense verbs "ha meso" instead of "ha messo". Also, it uses the English conjunction "and" instead of the Italian one "e". The correct usage of reflexive pronouns should also be applied ("ci" instead of "e").	Alice si è messa i vestiti nell'armadio.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ciò" is used correctly as a singular gender-neutral third person pronoun meaning "this" or "that", referring back to the previously mentioned event of Maria taking off her clothes.

The phrase "suo rappresentante" correctly indicates possession using the possessive adjective "suo".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Sofia delegates Maria as her representative." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Sofia"), verb ("delegates") and object ("Maria"). Moreover, the use of possessive determiner "her" before noun "representative" indicates that Maria is being appointed by Sofia herself.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence contains an incorrect use of the verb "abitare". It should be followed by the preposition "in" and then the location. Also, there is no need for a comma before "e ciò succede a Roma", as it does not introduce a new independent clause.	Lorenzo abita a Roma, e ciò succede anche a Roma.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	Riccardo has eaten the pizza and that happened at the restaurant. (This is just to confirm that the corrected sentence matches what was intended by the original.)

1	The sentence "Le bombe piovevano su di noi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, the third person plural form of the imperfect tense of the verb "piovere," which is "piovevano," has been used correctly to agree with its subject "le bombe." Additionally, the preposition "su" followed by the pronoun "di noi" indicates where the bombs were falling. Therefore, there are no apparent errors in the given sentence that would warrant changing or rephrasing it.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "I matrimoni misti funzionano in modo perfetto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, the subject is "I matrimoni misti," which is plural, so the verb must also be in its third person plural form, "funzionano." This agreement between the subject and verb is necessary for proper grammar in Italian. Additionally, the word order is appropriate, with the subject coming before the verb and the adverbial phrase "in modo perfetto" providing additional information about how the marriages function. Overall, there are no errors or inconsistencies that would make this sentence unacceptable in standard Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard structure of a declarative statement with a subject ("la tua idea") and a predicate ("equivale alla mia").

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to match with the subject "Alice" and "Maria" should be "badano".

Alice e Maria si prendono cura l'una dell'altra.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Dubitare" can be used with both singular and plural subjects, followed by the conjugated form of "essere", which in this case is "di".	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Che Giulia sia sempre in viaggio piace ad Andrea." is grammatically correct because it uses the subjunctive mood to express uncertainty or possibility in Italian language.

This subordinate clause contains another future tense verb that refers to the president as the subject. Overall, this sentence follows all the rules of agreement between subjects and verbs, and uses appropriate word order for expressing ideas clearly.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "partire" should be conjugated to match the subject "Alessandro and Paola." In this case, it would be "partiamo," not "si parta." Also, there is an unnecessary "che" before "si parta."	Alessandro invita Paola a partire insieme.

1	The sentence "La partenza apporta un beneficio a tutti" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, "la partenza," which means "the departure," functions as the subject; "apporta," which means "brings," serves as the verb in third person singular form, agreeing with the number and gender of its subject; and "un beneficio a tutti," meaning "a benefit to all," acts as the direct object complement. All elements are arranged according to standard word order, making the whole phrase syntactically sound. Final answer: Label: 1 Explanation: The given sentence is grammatically correct.	La partenza apporta un beneficio a tutti.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence, which is followed by the verb "si lamenta". Then there are two objects - "del mare" (complimentary object indicating what he is complaining about) and "con Paola" (indicating with whom he is doing this action). All nouns have appropriate articles and adjectives agree with them in gender and number. Therefore, I can conclude that this phrase is grammatically correct.	Alessandro si lamenta del mare sporco con Paola.

1	The sentence "Andrea lascia a Leonardo pieni poteri" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows standard Italian syntax rules.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should agree with its subject in number and person, so it is necessary to use "do" instead of "does" because the subject "ragazzi" is plural.	I ragazzi non **d**anno fastidio al cibo. (The corrected sentence has been bolded.)
0	The phrase contains a slang expression that is not grammatically correct and may be considered offensive or vulgar by some people. It would be better to use a more polite and formal way of expressing frustration or annoyance.	La frase non è corretta. Si potrebbe dire "Mi dà fastidio" oppure "Non mi piace".
1	The sentence "Alice si è attaccata a un capello" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this sentence, "si è" is the auxiliary verb used to form the reflexive past tense, while "attaccata" is the past participle that agrees with the feminine gender and singular number of the subject "Alice." Moreover, the preposition "a" followed by the definite article "un" indicates that the noun "capello" refers to a specific hair. Therefore, there are no errors or improvements needed for this sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria ha piantato Riccardo in asso" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb conjugation for the given subject.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Sofia and Riccardo speak the same language." is grammatically correct because it follows the English syntax rules for forming sentences. It has a subject ("Sofia and Riccardo") and a predicate ("speak the same language"). Moreover, both subjects are plural nouns that agree with the verb "speak" which is also in its plural form.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct phrase should be "Avere coraggio" instead of "Avere fegato". In Italian, the word for liver is not used to express bravery or courage.	Avere coraggio.
0	The verb "avere" should be used with the third person singular subject pronoun "esso", not the first person plural subject pronoun "noi". Also, there is no need for an object pronoun like "le" because the sentence does not include a direct or indirect object.	Egli ha le paturnie. (or simply "Ha le paturnie.")
0	The correct phrase should be "Avere qualcosa sulle scatole" which means to get on someone's nerves. The current form is not grammatically correct and does not make sense in Italian.	La frase corretta sarebbe "Lei ha qualcosa sulle scatole."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a subject and verb. It seems like part of a quote from Dante's Inferno, but as written, the sentence does not make sense on its own. A more complete version would be "Essere in un ventre di vacca" which means "To be inside a cow's womb." However, even with this addition, the sentence still requires additional context to fully understand its meaning.	Essere in un ventre di vacca.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo spera che possa partire presto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugation for the third person singular (Riccardo) and the imperfect subjunctive mood ("possa") which expresses doubt or uncertainty about a future event.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "Beatrice". In this case, it should be in third person singular form "has", not first or third person plural form "ha".	Beatrice has an attention for Giulia. (Note: I am assuming that "an attention" is used here as a noun phrase to mean something like "special interest" or "focus on". If it isn't, then please let me know.)
1	The sentence "Alice is worried" is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular form of the verb "to be," which is "is." This matches with the subject "Alice," which is also third person singular.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In questa frase manca il verbo ausiliare necessario per formare il tempo passato conosciuto come "passato prossimo" in italiano. Quando si usano i pronomi oggetto ("lo", "la", "li", "le") prima del verbo, è richiesto un auxiliary verb (essere/avere) per concordare con il soggetto ed esprimere il tempo corretto. Nel caso specifico di "li", che indica più di uno maschile, l'auxiliary verb appropriato sarebbe stato "hanno". Tuttavia, poiché qui stiamo utilizzando il verbo "vedere" al posto di "giocare", dobbiamo seguire le regole dei tempi composti italiani. Pertanto, il verbo ausiliare da utilizzare sarà "essere". La forma corretta della frase sarebbe stata: "Li ho visti giocare nel parco."	Li ho visti giocare nel parco.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I two children" agrees with the verb "vogliono" and the plural form of the noun "soldatini" is used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "obbedisce" agrees with the subject "Edoardo", which is singular and masculine.	La frase è già corretta. Confidence: 95%
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, since the subject is "Edoardo", which is singular and third person, the correct form of the verb to be is "va". Therefore, it should say "Edoardo ci va" instead of "Edoardo ci vanno".	La frase corretta è: "Edoardo ci va."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense of the auxiliary verb "andare" which is "andrà". This indicates that the action will take place after buying the swimsuit.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The subject of the sentence "Beatrice" requires a third person singular verb form like "scappa". The current form is missing an ending to agree with the subject.	Beatrice scappa a comprare. (The phrase should be "Beatrice escapes to buy." in English.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for each subject ("Leonardo" takes "mette", while "libri" takes "che").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Edoardo mette i libri sugli scaffali." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject coming before the verb and the object following the verb. In this case, the subject is "Edoardo," the verb is "mette" and the direct object is "i libri". Additionally, the preposition "sugli" correctly indicates that the books are being placed on top of something, which is clarified by the noun phrase "gli scaffali", meaning bookcases or shelves.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Andrea mangia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an Italian sentence with a singular subject and verb. In this case, "Andrea" is the subject and "mangia," which means "eats," is the verb. Since "Andrea" is a third-person singular noun, we use the corresponding form of the verb, which is "mangia."	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Leonardo legg**eva** su el sofá" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "leggere" for third person singular in past tense ("leggeva") and correctly indicates the location with "su".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rules where "il consenso" which is plural in form matches with its singular verb "è". Moreover, there is an appropriate use of article "della" before "gente", showing possession and specifying that it refers to people as a group. Also, "dal suo talento" correctly indicates that "consensus" originated from his/her talent.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Francesco" is the subject of the sentence, followed by the verb "guarda" in third person singular present tense, indicating that he is watching something or someone. The infinitive phrase "che tutto proceda per il meglately" functions as the direct object of the sentence, expressing what Francesco is watching. This structure is common in Italian to convey actions being done with intention.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Si" is used here as an impersonal reflexive pronoun to indicate that the subject of the embedded clause is not explicitly mentioned.

0	The verb "hanno" should agree with the plural subject "tutti." In this case, it would be more grammatically correct to say "Hanno tutti dato l'allarme?" instead of "Hanno messo tutti in allarme?" which changes the meaning of the sentence to "Did they set off all the alarms?" rather than "Did everyone give the alarm?"	Hanno tutti dato l'allarme?
0	The subject "gli" requires the third person singular form of the verb, which is "monta". In this case, it should be "gli monta" instead of "gli mount".	La monta il sangue alla testa molto facilmente.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Gabriele has made Lorenzo write a letter to Riccardo.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the past participle "broken" must agree with the direct object "il vetro." Also, there should be only one subject for the verb "ha fatto." A corrected version of this sentence would require two separate sentences or joining them using appropriate conjunctions and making sure that verbs are consistent with their subjects.	Il vento ha rotto il vetro. Oppure: Il vento ha fatto sì che il vetro si rompesse da parte di Andrea.
0	The correct form should be "The colonel has commanded the ship" or "Il colonnello ha comandato la nave". In English, we use "has made" to indicate that someone created something, not when they were in charge of it. Similarly, in Italian, "ha fatto" is used for making rather than commanding.	The colonel has commanded the ship. (In Italian): Il colonnello ha comandato la nave.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo si è fatto rompere la vetrata." is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian because it follows the standard structure for passive voice with the auxiliary verb "essere" conjugated correctly according to the subject "Lorenzo".

Therefore, I would rate this sentence as:	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the use of "io" as a subject pronoun is redundant because it is already understood from the verb form that follows ("sono andato"). Therefore, we can remove it to make the sentence grammatically correct.	Sono andato al negozio ieri. (Note: The asterisk (*) before the sentence indicates that it is not grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "l'auto" agrees with the verb "ha schiacciato" in number and tense. Also, the article "l'acceleratore" correctly matches the gender of "l'auto."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of "colpire" (to hit) is "ha colpito". Also, "l'acceleratore" is correctly used with an article before it since it is a specific part of a car.	Il colpo ha schiacciato l'acceleratore. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha rotto il fidanzamento." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "doesn't" should agree with the subject "bambini", which is plural; however, it does not match the third person singular form of the verb "like". Instead, we need to use "don't" as the correct negating auxiliary verb that agrees with the plural noun "bambini". Additionally, there needs to be an apostrophe after "children" indicating possession if this phrase wants to convey that the children own something called spinach. However, given the context provided I assume the intended meaning was just expressing dislikeness and thus no possessive relation exists between the kids and the spinaches. So, let me reformulate the corrected sentence without the implied but unnecessary genitive relationship.	"I bambini non piacciono gli spinaci."
1	The sentence "Paola ha trascurato se stessa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Paola") and a verb in past tense that agrees with the subject ("ha trascurato").

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "I prati si sono rivestiti con i fiori" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this sentence, "si sono rivestiti" is the past tense third-person plural form of the reflexive verb "rivestire," which means to cover or dress oneself. This verb agrees with its subject, "i prati," which is also in the plural form. Additionally, "con i flori" is a prepositional phrase that correctly modifies the verb by indicating what has covered the meadows.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.

0	The verb "impel" does not mean to shed fur. A more appropriate word would be "shed." Additionally, the phrase should read "on," not "of."	Il gatto ha **shed** dei peli sul divano. (or, alternatively, for better fluency: Il gatto ha perso una quantità di pelo sul divano.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The sentence "L'inverno ha privato delle foglie agli alberi" has the correct word order and verb conjugation for the subject ("l'inverno") and direct object ("gli alberi").

Additionally, using the singular form "poche" instead of plural "poco" since it refers to weeks ("settimane") which are always considered as feminine plural nouns when counting them. Overall, this phrase follows standard Italian language rules.

1	The sentence "Gabriele ha proseguito la lezione per ore." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb form changes depending on the gender and number of the subject.

1	The sentence "Il lievito ha fermentato la pasta in due ore" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order.

Additionally, the preposition "di" followed by a number ("due") indicates an amount of time.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the verb "leggevo" does not agree with its subject "I". The correct form of the verb should be "legg**e**vo", since "I" is a first-person singular pronoun. Therefore, the use of the second conjugation instead of the third one leads to an incorrect sentence.	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "Leggevo un libro ieri sera."

0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this sentence, the subject is "bambini" which is plural, so the correct form of the verb to be used is "don't" instead of "doesn't". Also, "like" should be used instead of "to like".	I bambini don't like to eat vegetables.
0	In questa frase c'è uno sbaglio nell'utilizzo del verbo "començar" e nella forma del pronome personale soggetto "il". Nel catalano corretto il verbo "començar" richiede sempre la forma verbale con la desinenza "-a", indipendentemente dal numero e dal genere dell'argomento; pertanto, la forma corretta è "ha començat". Per quanto riguarda i pronomi personali soggetto, nel catalano standard moderno sono solitamente omessi quando precedono il verbo. Tuttavia, per indicare una persona maschile singolare utilizziamo normalmente "ell" anziché "el" prima dei verbi ausiliari come "haver" ("avere") e "ésser" ("essere"). Quindi, il pronome personale soggetto da usare davanti al verbo "haver" sarebbe "ell". Pertanto, la forma corretta della frase è "Ell ha començat a agitar-se".	Ell ha començat a agitar-se.
1	L'uso del pronombre personale complemento "li" con il verbo "mangiare" per riferirsi a più di una mela è corretto in Italiano. Inoltre, il numero verbale concorda correttamente con il soggetto ("hai", seconda persona singolare al presente indicativo, si accorda con "tu").	La frase è già corretta.
0	La frase contiene un errore nella concordanza del verbo con il soggetto. In particolare, si usa il verbo plurale "sono" anziché il verbo singolare "è", poiché il soggetto ("I due libri") è al plurale.	I due libri sono interessanti.
1	The sentence "Il pullover di lana si è infeltrito" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In this case, we have the singular masculine subject "il pullover" which agrees with the verb "si è infeltrito". The past participle "infeltrito" must agree in gender and number with the subject, so the use of the feminine or plural form would be incorrect. Moreover, the auxiliary verb used here ("essere") is also correctly conjugated in the third person singular for the compound tense "passato prossimo". Therefore, no corrections are needed to make the sentence grammatically correct, and I can confirm that:	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Edoardo si è fatto simile a uno scheletro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for Italian sentences.

La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La carne è diventata gustosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, "la carne," which means "the meat," is the subject, while "è diventata gustosa," meaning "has become delicious," describes what has happened to the meat. This structure is consistent with standard Italian sentence construction. Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: The sentence "La carne è diventata gustosa" is grammatically correct.	La carne è diventata gustosa.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ingarbugliata" is the past participle of the verb "ingarbugliare," which means to become tangled or complicated. It agrees with the subject "la situazione."	La situazione è diventata ingarbugliata.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The use of the past tense "si è fatta" with the feminine singular adjective "puzzolente" correctly describes that the air became smelly. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence, as there are no errors related to number or gender concordance between words. Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically correct in Italian.
1	The phrase "ingarbugliatissima" is the superlative form of the adjective "intricato", which means very tangled or complicated. It is grammatically correct and can be used to emphasize the high degree of confusion or complexity in a situation. However, it may not be commonly used due to its complex structure and strong emphasis. A more frequently used word might be "molto complicata".	La situazione diventa molto complicata.
0	In the sentence "A Riccardo, questi argomenti non l'han convinto," there is no agreement between the plural verb form "non l'han" and its singular subject "Riccardo." Also, it should be "lo hanno" instead of "l'han".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "A Riccardo, questi argomenti non lo hanno convinto."
1	The sentence "La follia spaventa Francesco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian declarative sentence with a subject ("la follia") and a verb ("spaventa").	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to use with "la ragazza" is "ha," not just "ha." In Italian, when using the third person singular, you need to add an -a or -e at the end of the verb depending on whether it ends in -o or another letter respectively. Therefore, since "innervosire" ends in "-ire", we add "-a".	La ragazza ha innervosito Andrea.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rules for compound subjects, where "hanno" agrees with the plural subject "le ragazze".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Quei fuochi hanno innervosito Edoardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "hanno innervosito" agrees with its plural subject "quei fuochi".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "fare" should be followed by an infinitive verb, but here it is followed by the past participle "calmato". Also, there are two objects of the action ("Andrea" and "quell'uomo"), so we need to use reflexive pronouns to indicate who performs the action.	Alice ha fatto calmare ad Andrea quell'uomo. Alternatively, if Alice made Andrea calm down himself, then the sentence would be: "Alice lo ha fatto calmare."
0	The correct form of the verb "preoccupare" should be used here. It is an irregular verb and its third person singular present indicative form is "fa preoccupare", not "ha fatto preoccupare". Also, there shouldn't be any comma before "dalla fidanzata".	Maria fa preoccupare Gabriele dalla fidanzata.
1	The sentence "Maria ha fatto innamorare Leonardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject ("Maria") coming before the verb ("ha fatto"). Additionally, the use of the past tense form of the verb "fare" and the verb "innamorare" are both appropriate for this context.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to agree with "Riccardo" should be used. In this case, it would be "si siede". Also, there is no need for the reflexive pronoun "si" before "seduce", as that changes the meaning of the sentence.	Riccardo si siede.
0	The correct form of the past participle for "piacere" with the auxiliary verb "essere" is "piaciuto", not "si è piaciuto". Also, there should be an object after "per".	Lorenzo ha piaciuto per questo.

Therefore, this sentence can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è agitato a quella notizia." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order.

La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo è irritato da quella notizia" is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the verb "essere" which agrees with the subject "Riccardo."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "ha," which are both singular and in third person. Additionally, the preposition "di" is used correctly to introduce the object of fear "ciò."	Maria has timor of that.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Si" can be used as an impersonal reflexive pronoun that refers to someone unspecified or unknown, which fits the context of this sentence very well. This usage is common when expressing general truths or feelings shared by people in general. In English, it would translate roughly to "one feels."	La frase è già corretta.
0	This sentence is an example of a double negative which is grammatically incorrect in standard English. "Don't" and "no" both express negativity resulting in the meaning being distorted. Instead, one should be used to maintain clarity and proper grammar.	I don't have any money.
1	The sentence "Sofia ha i nervi a fior di pelle" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha" agrees with its singular feminine subject "Sofia".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Emma is surprised" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of a verb typically ends with an -s or -es.

1	The sentence "Paola está en un estado de terror" is grammatically correct and understandable. It uses the third person singular form of the verb "estar," which agrees with the subject "Paola." The word "terror" is used as a noun to describe her state or condition.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The sentence "L'esplosione ha frantumato il vetro" has the following structure: subject ("l'esplosione"), auxiliary verb ("ha"), past participle ("frantumato") and direct object ("il vetro"). This order of words follows the standard rules for forming sentences in Italian. Additionally, all verbs are conjugated correctly based on their tense and agreement with the subject. Therefore, this sentence can be classified as grammatically correct.
0	In this sentence, the subject of the verb "disgustare" is singular ("quella pietanza"), but the plural form of the verb ("hanno") is used instead of the singular one ("ha"). This creates an agreement error between the subject and the verb.	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Quella pietanza lo ha disgustato a Francesco."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Lo" refers to the masculine singular direct object pronoun used before the verb, while "stato" is the past participle of the verb "stare." Together they form the passive construction that translates as "the state of health" being referred to. Then "di mia madre" specifies whose health status we are talking about. Finally, "mi ha preoccupato subito" means it worried me right away. Therefore, this phrase describes how the speaker was immediately concerned with their mother's health condition when mentioned. Answer:	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Il" refers to the masculine singular subject, while "fuma" agrees with it in number and gender.

Finally, "di Paola" shows possession which is appropriate here.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Beatrice ha irritato Francesco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for expressing an action performed by a subject on an object in Italian. In this case, "Beatrice" is the subject performing the action of "irritating," and "Francesco" is the direct object being irritated.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha" agrees with the singular masculine noun "arrivo." Additionally, it uses the past participle correctly to indicate that the action occurred in the past.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La reputazione di Emma si è distrutta con quello scandalo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word agreement. In this case, "reputazione" agrees with "si è," which are both singular and feminine gender. Additionally, "di Emma" correctly shows possession using the preposition "di." Lastly, "con quello scandalo" uses "quello" as an adjective to modify "scandalo" indicating that specific scandal being referred to has already been mentioned or known by context. Therefore, the sentence structure and usage of words and phrases follow standard Italian language conventions.	La reputazione di Emma si è distrutta con quello scandalo.
0	The verb "sgretolare" agrees with the singular subject "l'intonaco", so it should be "si è sgretolato". Also, there is no article before "intonaco" because it starts with a vowel sound.	L'intonaco si è sgretolato. Note that I added an accent mark to "intonaco" as well, since Italian words can change meaning based on stress and must have at least one vowel with an accent if they end in a vowel or -s.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Giulia ha spento le polemiche" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an indicative sentence in Italian with a subject ("Giulia"), verb ("ha spento") and object ("le polemiche"). In this case, "ha spento" agrees with its singular subject "Giulia".	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the verb "sono" should be changed to "ero", because it is used with the past tense of the verb "andare". The correct form for first person singular in the imperfect tense ("era") must be used instead of the present tense ("sono").	Io ero andato al negozio ieri. (I had gone to the store yesterday.)
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the reflexive verb "si è rotta" should agree with the gender and number of the subject. In this case, it should be "Gabriele si è rotto il braccio", assuming that Gabriele broke his arm.	Gabriele si è rotto il braccio.
1	The sentence "Riccardo è desideroso di partire" is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the verb "essere", which agrees with the subject "Riccardo". Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are used correctly and appropriately.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Gabriele sta alla tavola" is grammatically correct but it uses the reflexive form of the verb instead of the transitive one.

1	The sentence "Beatrice porta un piatto in tavola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Beatrice"), verb ("porta") and object ("piatto").

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Cadere" can be used both as transitive and intransitive verb. In this case it is being used in the intransitive form which means to fall down or drop to the ground suddenly. Therefore, no object needs to follow this verb.	Maria cade per terra. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Andrea has enrolled his son to dance school" is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper prepositions.	La frase è già corretta. No need for corrections.
1	The sentence "Emma ha portato il pacco a scuola." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject coming first followed by the verb and then the object.

Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: La frase "Emma ha portato il pacco a scuola." è grammaticalmente corretta perché segue la struttura standard di una frase italiana con il soggetto che viene prima del verbo e poi dell'oggetto. In questo caso, il soggetto è "Emma", il verbo è "ha portato" che concorda con il pronome femminile singolare di terza persona "Emma", e l'oggetto è "il pacco". Inoltre, tutte le parole sono correttamente coniugate per tempo, numero e genere.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Francesco sta in poltrona." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "Francesco" is the subject, which requires the third person singular form of the verb "stare," which is "sta." Additionally, "poltrona" is feminine singular, so there are no issues with agreement here either.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "essere" should agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, the correct form of the verb to use is "è". Also, there shouldn't be a preposition before the pronoun "esso/essa". A more appropriate way to express this idea would be: "La palla è finita dietro."	La palla è finita dietro.

Pertanto, la forma corretta sarebbe "il **nave** affonda" (singolare), oppure per riferirsi al plurale "(le) navi affondano". Tuttavia, nel caso specifico dell'esempio dato, "ammarò" andrebbe utilizzato come tempo passato corretto.	La nave affonda. Oppure, visto il contesto fornito nell'esempio: La nave ammarò.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "I marinai" is the plural form of "il marinaio," which means "the sailor." In this case, since there are multiple sailors, the plural form is used correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In Italian, when talking about singular nouns such as "dollaro" (dollar), the third person singular form of the verb must be used. The plural form is incorrect. Additionally, there is no agreement between the subject and the verb; both should agree in number. In this case, since "dollar" is singular, we need to use the corresponding singular form of the verb.	Il dollaro è aumentato.

There are no apparent errors or typos that would make this sentence incorrect.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it would be more natural to say "Ho perso troppo spesso il treno in questa redazione" or "È stata perduta molte volte la coincidenza in questa redazione."	È stato perso troppe volte il treno, in questa redazione. (The phrase is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Bussola" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb form "fu". The direct object is "la bussola", which also agrees with its corresponding article "la". The agent who performed the action is expressed using "da + nome proprio", which is "Gabriele". Therefore, I can say that this sentence follows all the rules for forming sentences in Italian.	La bussola fu persa da Gabriele.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Si" is used here as a reflexive pronoun that refers to the subject of the sentence, which is "Andrea". This type of construction is called "passivante", where the object of the action becomes the subject of the sentence. In this case, "si" is not the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "essere" ("to be") but rather a reflexive pronoun.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the past participle for the verb "andare" is "andati", but it should be used with an auxiliary verb such as "essere". In this case, since the subject is third person plural ("li"), the correct auxiliary verb to use is "sono". Therefore, the sentence should be "Li ho visti andare via".	Li ho visti andare via.
0	The verb "mise" is not a standard Italian word and should be replaced with the past tense of "mettere", which would be "mise" if we were following the conjugation for he/she/you(formal)/we but the subject here is "Tommaso" so it should be "mise" or "mettette".	Tommaso mise la valigia nel bagagliaio. OR Tommaso mettette la valigia nel bagagliaio.
0	The verb "dire" requires the preposition "a" before the indirect object pronouns "gli", "le", "loro". Also, when using the past tense of "dire", you need to use "disse" for he/she and "dissi" for I. In this case, it should be "Lorenzo **ne** disse **due a** Maria." instead of "Lorenzo ne disse due a Maria."	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "Lorenzo ne disse due a Maria."
1	The sentence "Beatrice prese fischi per fiaschi" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, "prese" is the past tense of the verb "prendere", which means to take or to grab, while "fischi per fiaschi" is an idiomatic expression that literally translates to "whistles for flasks" but figuratively means to mistake one thing for another or to be mistaken about something important. Overall, the sentence suggests that Beatrice made a mistake or misjudgment regarding something significant.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso butta olio sul fuoco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Tommaso") and a verb ("butta").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo tirò l'acqua al proprio mulino" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, the third person singular past tense form of the verb "tirare" (to draw or to pull) is used correctly with the subject "Riccardo." Additionally, the preposition "al" is appropriately followed by the definite article "proprio," which modifies the noun "mulino" (mill).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence, followed by the reflexive verb "si diede," which means "he gave to himself." This is an example of indirect reflexivity. The direct object pronoun "la" refers back to "zappa," which has been omitted from the sentence but understood in context. In this case, it would translate to "Alessandro gave himself the hoe."	Alessandro si diede la zappa sui piedi.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Emma ascolta un disco. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order, uses the correct verb tense (passato prossimo), and has proper agreement between subject and verb.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo fa le traduzioni dei bollettini di guerra." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and a verb ("fa") that agrees in number and person with the subject. Additionally, the object of the sentence ("le traduzioni dei bollettini di guerra") correctly uses the definite article "le" to agree with the masculine plural noun "traduzioni".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Di te" means "of you", and it can be used before a verb to indicate the subject of that verb. In this case, "ride" is the verb, and "di te" indicates who is doing the action. The word "beffarda" is an adjective describing how she laughs, and since it comes after the noun it modifies ("risata"), it must agree with the gender and number of that noun. Here, the noun "risata" is feminine singular, so the corresponding form of the adjective "beffardo" should also be feminine singular, which is "beffarda". Therefore, the sentence "Di te ride in maniera beffarda." is grammatically correct. Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: The sentence is already correct.	Di te ride in maniera beffarda.
1	The sentence "Tommaso legge." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for an Italian declarative sentence with a third-person singular subject and present tense verb conjugation.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Tommaso dà un libro a Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper singular forms of verbs to agree with the number of subjects.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian because it uses the appropriate form of the auxiliary verb "avere" ("ha") to construct the compound past tense with the passive participle "telefonato," which agrees in gender and number with the subject "Andrea." Additionally, the second clause correctly employs the auxiliary verb "essere" ("è") for the passive construction "sia ritornata," agreeing in gender and number with the subject "Giulia." This structure effectively communicates that Andrea's phone call caused Giulia's return.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo telefona ad Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, "telefona" is the third person singular conjugation of the verb "telefonare," which agrees with the subject "Riccardo." Additionally, "ad" is used correctly as a preposition to indicate movement toward something or someone.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Emma sta soffrendo" is grammatically correct because it uses the present continuous tense correctly to indicate that Emma is currently experiencing distress or anxiety.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In the present tense of verbs in Italian, third person singular subjects ("he" or "she") require an -a ending on regular verbs. Therefore, "odia" is needed instead of "odias."	Leonardo odia Maria. (Note: I added an accent to the letter é because it should be written with one.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features an interrogative form that requires the use of an auxiliary verb ("odia" = "hates") followed by the subject ("Paola"). This structure is commonly used to ask questions in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro andò a salutare il padre." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense usage. In this case, the past tense form of the verb "andare" agrees with the singular masculine subject "Alessandro," and the definite article "il" correctly precedes the noun "padre."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Girò" is the past tense of the verb "girare" (to turn), which agrees with the subject "Alessandro". The phrase "con l'auto" means "with the car", indicating how he turned to pick her up. Therefore, there are no errors or improvements needed for this sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il battello virò a salvarli" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar for verb conjugation and word order. In this case, the past tense of the verb "virare," which means to turn or veer, is used correctly with the subject "il battello." Additionally, the indirect object pronoun "loro" is placed after the infinitive "salvare" as required by standard Italian usage.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" is the subject and takes the third person singular form of the verb "obbedire," which is "obbedisce." The pronoun "lui" refers to the direct object.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "I soldati hanno passato le armi ai prigionieri" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian verbs, where the verb form must agree with the number and gender of the subject. In this case, "soldati" is plural masculine, so "hanno" which is also plural masculine, agrees with it correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should be conjugated to match the subject, so it should be "ama" instead of "amano". In this sentence, "Alessandro" is singular and requires a singular verb form.	La frase corretta è "Alessandro ama i bignè."
1	The sentence "Il cedro ama la libertà" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("il cedro") and a verb ("ama") that agrees in number and tense. Additionally, the object ("la libertà") correctly uses the feminine singular article to agree with its noun.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il giardiniere" agrees with the verb "ha potato" and the object of the sentence "il barboncino di Edoardo" correctly follows the verb.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, there is an incorrect use of the possessive adjective "suo" and the pronoun "gli". Since the name "Lorenzo" is masculine singular, one should use either "suo" or "gli", but not both. The correct form would be "A Lorenzo, Alessandro gli ha lasciato una ricca eredità." OR "A Lorenzo, Alessandro ha lasciato una ricca eredità."	A Lorenzo, Alessandro gli ha lasciato una ricca eredità. (or) A Lorenzo, Alessandro ha lasciato una ricca eredità.
1	The sentence "Alessandro beve il suo caffè." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations for third person singular masculine form (Alessandro) with the present tense of the verb "bere" which means to drink. It also correctly uses the definite article "il" before the noun "caffè".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Alessandro desidera rivedere Beatrice. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the correct use of singular and plural forms ("un" vs "gli"), as well as appropriate word order and tense usage.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In questa frase manca il verbo ausiliare "ho" per formare il tempo presente del modo indicativo nella prima persona singolare dell'indicativo presente. La forma corretta sarebbe "Vado al parco".	Io vado al parco. Spiegazione completa: In italiano, come in molte altre lingue indoeuropee, ci sono due tipologie principali di coniugazioni verbali: regolari e irregolari. Nel caso specifico delle forme verbali nel modo indicativo del presente, esistono tre gruppi distinti: -verbi arricchiti (-AR), -verbi tematici (-ER, -IR) e -verbi atoni (-ERE, -IRE). Ogni gruppo segue una propria flessione e le sue eccezioni. Nello specifico, i verbi appartenenti al gruppo dei verbi arricchiti seguono lo schema io Canto-tu Canti-egli canTA; i verbi tematici seguono lo schema io Parlo-tu ParlI-egli PARLA; infine, i verbi atoni hanno le terminazioni identiche ai verbi tematici ma cambiano anche la radice alla quale si aggiungono le desinenze sopra riportate. Tornando all'esempio proposto ("Io VAI AL PARCO"), essendo il verbo "andare", facente parte del gruppo dei verbi arricchiti, avremmo dovuto usare la terza persona singolare del passato remoto "Andai" (che significa andavo) anziché utilizzare erroneamente la seconda persona singolare "VAI". Pertanto, la correzione da apportare sarà quella citata precedentemente ("IO VADO AL PARCO").
1	The sentence "Gabriele segue una rigida condotta morale" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Specifically, the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "segue" in number (singular) and person (third), and the adjective "rigida" modifies the noun "condotta" correctly by agreeing in gender (feminine) and number (singular). Moreover, the word order respects the canonical SOV pattern in Italian subordinate clauses.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. However, it might sound more natural to use the plural form of the verb "praticare" since there are multiple mosquitoes implied by "le zanzare." But using the singular form "pratica" doesn't make the sentence incorrect.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the word "cotta" should be replaced with "attrazione" or similar words to indicate that the refrigerator has affection for Francesco. Additionally, it would be more appropriate to say that a person has an attraction rather than an object like a refrigerator.	La frase non è corretta. Si potrebbe dire "Francesco ha lasciato il cibo fuori dal frigo ed ora c'è un'attrazione magnetica tra lui e l'elettrodomestico."
1	The sentence "Tommaso diede degli schiaffi a Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugation for the past tense and agreement between subject and object pronouns.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo allungò uno schiaffo a Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, "allungò" is the past tense of "allungare," which means to stretch or reach out, while "uno schiaffo" refers to a slap. Together with the preposition "a", they form the verb phrase that describes Riccardo's action towards Giulia.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "resta", which is conjugated correctly for third person singular. Also, the adverb "in silenzio" is used properly to describe how Riccardo remains.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non ha più sospetti su Emma." is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations for third person singular subject ("Riccardo") with negation ("non") and past participle form ("ha avuto" becomes "ha più").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo riceve aiuto da Edoardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo") and an object ("aiuto"), as well as including a verb ("riceve") that agrees with its singular subject both in number and tense. Additionally, the preposition "da" correctly indicates the source or origin of the help received by Lorenzo.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "agitates" does not match the subject "Alessandro". In present tense, for third person singular subjects like "he", "she", or "Alessandro", we use the -s form of the verb, which is "agita" in this case.	La frase non è corretta. La frase corretta sarebbe: "Alessandro agita Beatrice."
1	The sentence "Edoardo fa friggere l'uovo nella padella." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "Edoardo," which requires the use of the third-person singular form of the verb "fare" (to make or to do). The action itself is described by the infinitive phrase "fa friggere l'uovo nella padella" (he makes fry the egg in the pan), where "friggere" is an infinitive verb that agrees with the subject of the sentence. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence from a grammatical perspective.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo procede al caricamento del camion di casse" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. Here, the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the third person singular present tense verb form "procede," while the prepositional phrase "al caricamento del camion di casse" provides additional information about what Riccardo is doing.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.

La stilografica è caricata.
1	The sentence "Tommaso fruga nei cassetti della scrivania di Giulia" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea carica l'orologio." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order for an Italian simple sentence. In this case, "Andrea" is the subject of the sentence, which requires the third person singular form of the verb "caricare," which is "carica."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "dà" should agree with the subject "Riccardo", so it should be "da". Also, there is no need for an article before "cane".	Riccardo da molti colpi al cane.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. There are no errors that would significantly impair communication or understanding of the intended message.	Lorenzo salì, per una seconda volta, le scale di corsa. (Note: I have corrected "sale" to its past tense form "salì", as it seems more appropriate given the context.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Beatrice has the task of abducting Emma. (I have translated it to English for better understanding as the original sentence was already grammatically correct.)
0	The correct form of the verb should be "corre" instead of "corre". In this sentence, since the subject is singular ("Alessandro"), the verb must also be singular and agree with the subject.	Alessandro corri l'asina.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	The sentence "Francesco prende il cervo per le corna e lo atterra" is already correct. No changes are needed.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because refrigerators cannot seduce cats. It is not possible for household appliances to have this kind of relationship with animals.	La frase non è corretta. Una versione corretta potrebbe essere: "Il gatto si è intrufolato nel frigorifero."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because a refrigerator cannot seduce a table as they are both inanimate objects and it does not make logical sense for one to seduce the other.	La frase non è corretta.
0	The verb "ha" should agree with the subject "Riccardo", so it should be "é". Also, the word "minorenne" is singular and masculine or feminine, but there is no article before it to indicate its gender.	Riccardo ha sedotto una minore.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The word "applaudirono" used in the sentence is the third person plural of the passato remoto tense of the verb "applaudire", which means to clap or to applause. This tense is commonly used in formal writing or speech, especially when referring to past events that have already been completed. In this case, it is appropriate since the action of the entire room clapping at once is described.
1	The sentence "Paola ha letto un libro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. In this case, "Paola" is the singular feminine subject, so we use the third person singular form of the verb "leggere," which is "ha letto." Moreover, the direct object "un libro" comes after the verb as expected.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, "biglietti" is the correct form to match the plural feminine noun "maria".	Maria raccoglie biglietti d'amore. (if we want to say that Maria collects love letters) OR Maria ha una collezione di biglietti d'amore. (if we want to say that Maria has a collection of love letters)
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha tosato lo zio." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and a verb in past tense ("ha tosato"). Additionally, the direct object pronoun "lo" correctly refers to the masculine singular noun that comes after it ("zio").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Paola fa una corsa in giardino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject ("Paola") followed by the verb ("fa") and then the object or additional information about the action ("una corsa in giardino"). In this case, there are no grammar errors that would require correction.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo scambia libri con Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, we have two people, named Riccardo and Maria, who are engaging in an action, which is "scambiare" or to exchange. This verb agrees with its subject, "Riccardo," as evidenced by the use of the third-person singular form "-a". Additionally, the preposition "con" is used appropriately here, indicating that Riccardo is exchanging books with someone else, specifically Maria.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alice has furrowed her brow" is grammatically correct because it uses the present perfect tense ("has furrowed") to indicate that Alice performed an action (furrowing her brow) at an unspecified time in the past. In English, when using this verb form with a pronoun such as "her," we must also specify which person or object the pronoun refers to; here, "brow" serves that function.	Alice has furrowed her brow. Note: I am assuming you want me to check the English version of the sentence since my name is Angela and not Alice. If instead you meant for me to analyze the Italian version, please let me know!
1	The sentence "Maria ha curvato la faccia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject coming first and then the verb. In this case, the subject is "Maria" and the verb is "ha curvato". Additionally, the past tense of the verb has been used correctly to indicate that Maria performed the action of curving her face at some point in the past.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Sofia maintains head to the enemy" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and word usage. However, it might not convey the intended meaning clearly without additional context. In this case, I assume that you want to express that Sofia keeps her focus on the enemy or opposing force. If so, then an alternative formulation with clearer semantics would be more appropriate for conveying your message effectively.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro si gonfia la testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all of the words are correctly conjugated for gender and number.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Beatrice ha piantato in asso Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of Italian sentences. In this case, "Beatrice" is the subject, which requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "piantare", which is "ha piantato". Additionally, "Giulia" is the direct object, following proper word order after the verb. Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: The sentence is already correct.	Beatrice ha piantato in asso Giulia.
1	The sentence "Capire le intenzioni segrete di una persona" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word order. It means "Understanding the secret intentions of a person."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria cambia le carte" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "cambia" agrees with its singular subject "Maria."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "fa" should be conjugated to match the subject "Riccardo", which is singular. The correct form of the verb for this subject would be "fae".	Riccardo fa il cattivo gioco.
0	The correct form of the past tense should be used. "ha rotto" indicates that Andrea broke something belonging to Beatrice. However, if the meaning is that Andrea caused harm to Beatrice resulting in her death then the sentence needs to change accordingly.	If the intended meaning is that Andrea killed Beatrice then it should be: "Andrea ha ucciso Beatrice." Otherwise, if the original sentence means that Andrea accidentally or intentionally broke something owned by Beatrice then the corrected version would be: "Andrea ha rotto il collo di Beatrice."
0	The verb "rompere" should agree with the subject "la musica." In this case, it requires the third person singular form "rompe," not the plural form "rompono."	La musica rock rompe le orecchie.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ci" can be used as an indirect object pronoun to indicate the action is being done to or for oneself, and it agrees with the verb form of "ha". Also, "quello" should be written as "quel", since it refers to a singular masculine noun, which in this case is "che".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La mosca salta al naso di Riccardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and uses proper verb conjugations for each pronoun. In this case, "la mosca" is the subject, "salta" is the verb, and "al naso di Riccardardo" is the object.	La mosca salta al naso di Riccardo.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "going" which is in plural form. So it should be "go".	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "Andare al monte." (to go to the mountain) or "Vado al monte." if referring to oneself.
1	The sentence "Essere all'indice" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian grammar. However, it may not convey a complete thought or idea on its own as it seems to be an incomplete phrase rather than a full sentence. A more complete version could be something like "Il mio nome è all'indice," which means "My name is listed."	Essere all'indice is already grammatically correct, but here are some examples that use it in context: * Il mio nome è all'indice per il premio Nobel per la letteratura. (My name is listed for the Nobel Prize in Literature.) * Loro sono sempre all'indice quando si tratta di innovazione tecnologica. (They are always at the forefront when it comes to technological innovation.)
1	The phrase "Mettere all'indice" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard rules for forming verbs and their conjugations in Italian. In this case, "mettere" is the infinitive form of the verb "to put," while "all'indice" indicates where something should be placed, specifically on an index or list.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "alzare" requires an object to complete the meaning of the sentence. Without an object, it is grammatically incorrect.	La frase non è corretta. Una versione corretta potrebbe essere: "Alza il gomito." or "Alzi il gomito.", depending on context and speaker.
0	The correct phrase should be "Perdere la testa" or "Perdere il senno", as "perdere il lume della ragione" is not an idiomatic expression in Italian and it does not convey the intended meaning of going insane or losing one's mind.	La frase corretta sarebbe stata "Perdere la testa" o "Perdere il senno".
1	The phrase "Cavare la castagne dal fuoco a qualcuno" is grammatically correct and means to bail someone out or get them out of trouble.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The phrase contains a typographical error and lacks proper verb conjugation. It seems like it is trying to say "Essere poveri in canna," but even then the expression "poveri in canna" is not commonly used or understood in Italian. A correct alternative could be "Essere poveri in mezzo al mare." However, I cannot determine if this was the intended meaning of the original sentence due to its incorrectness.	La frase non è corretta. Una possibile versione corretta potrebbe essere "Essere poveri in mezzo al mare."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the verb "accompagnare" to agree with its subject "l'angelo custode", which is also singular.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ognuno ha il suo angelo custode che lo protegge." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper prepositions.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "A quella festa è di rigore lo smoking." is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the verb "essere" which agrees with the subject "quella festa". Also, the direct object "lo smoking" follows the correct masculine gender and singular number agreement with the adjective "di rigore".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "nuotare" should be used with subjects that can swim, like animals or people. In this case, the subject is an object ("la moto"). A correct verb for objects could be "shine", so the sentence would be: "La moto di Leonardo shines as new."	La moto di Leonardo splende come nuova.
1	The sentence "Ho visto un'unità in marcia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses verbs and nouns correctly. In this sentence, "ho visto" is the past tense of the verb "vedere", which means "to see". "Un'unità" is a singular feminine noun that refers to a unit or group of people or things. Finally, "in marcia" describes where the unit was seen, indicating motion and direction.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, there is no subject-verb agreement. The verb "piace" should agree with the singular subject "Leonardo," but instead it agrees with the plural "Che Leonardo."	Che Leonardo torni piaccia a Maria. (In English: That Leo return please Mary.)
1	The sentence "Sofia runs to eat." is grammatically correct as it follows the standard English Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses the third person singular present tense of the verb "to run" which agrees with the subject "Sofia".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea sorride a Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Andrea") and a verb ("sorride") conjugated correctly to match the subject, followed by the recipient of the action ("Sofia").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but the subject "Beatrice" should agree with the verb form. In this case, since the subject is singular, we need to use the third person singular form of the verb which is "bada".	Beatrice badas that the article is clear. (if you meant to say she checks or takes care of it being clear.) Or if you mean "Beatrice pays attention so that the article is clear", then the correct Italian sentence would be: Beatrice fa in modo che l'articolo sia chiaro.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Alessandro divorzia da Paola. (No correction needed because the given sentence is already grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence "Riccardo abita in una casa piccola." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations for third person singular present tense ("abita" instead of "abbiamo", which would be incorrect here).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria non sta a Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular present tense verbs ("sta" is the correct form for the verb "stare").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "mille" agrees with the verb "brillano", and the adverbial expression "nel cielo" indicates where the action takes place.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The phrase is grammatically correct. "Ciò" is used as a gender-neutral singular pronoun meaning "this," and it agrees with the singular noun "cosa."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it can be made clearer and more natural to native speakers by rephrasing it slightly. In the original phrase, "intensely" modifies "studies," which implies that Leonardo studies something else not as intensely during the remaining hours of his day. I assume this was not the intended meaning because the focus of the sentence seems to be on how many hours Leo dedicates to studying each day rather than on the intensity with which he does so. Therefore, moving "intensely" after "three hours" would make the meaning clearer without affecting grammaticality.	La frase è già corretta. However, for better clarity, you could consider changing it to: "Tutti i giorni, Leonardo studia intensamente per tre ore al giorno."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "toccare" agrees with its subject "la parete", and it follows the rules for past participle agreement when using auxiliary verbs like "essere".	La parete è toccata dalle spalle di Riccardo. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Lorenzo tocca la schiena di Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an Italian sentence and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "una tal conclusione" requires the third person singular form of the verb, which is "deriva". In this case, it should be "Deriva" instead of "Derivano".	La correttezza di una tal conclusione deriva da... (The correctness of such a conclusion derives from...)
1	The sentence "Gabriele mangia poca frutta." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject and a verb, and uses proper singular conjugation for the third person present tense.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should match the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is "Andrea" which is second person singular, so the correct form of the verb to use would be "bevi". However, you used "beve", which is the third person singular form.	Andrea bevi. (The sentence was almost correct except for the verb form.)
0	The verb "pizzica" does not agree with the subject "Francesco". It should be its plural form, which is "pizzicano", to match the number of the subject. Also, there is no need for an adverb such as "sadismically".	Francesco pizzica con crudeltà. (if we want to keep the meaning of causing pain deliberately) or Francesco pizzica le zanzare con soddisfazione. (if we mean that he squashes mosquitos and enjoys it.)
1	The sentence "Alessandro disegna sul muro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the singular third person present tense of verbs ending in -are like "disegnare" takes "a" as its ending when used with masculine singular subjects such as "Alessandro". Additionally, the word order and use of prepositions are also appropriate for the intended meaning which is that Alessandro is drawing on the wall.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the third-person singular form of the verb should be used to agree with the subject "Lorenzo". The plural form "ballan" is incorrect.	La frase corretta è: "Lorenzo balla la rumba."
1	The sentence "La siesta es una pequeña dormida" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a Spanish sentence with a subject ("la siesta") and a predicate ("es una pequeña dormida"). Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated for gender and number agreement.	La siesta es una pequeña dormida. Note that I assumed you meant to ask about this sentence in Spanish since "siesta" and "dormida" are both Spanish words. If my assumption was incorrect, please let me know!
1	The sentence "Francesco nuota a rana" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Francesco") and a verb ("nuota") conjugated to match the subject in number and gender. In this case, "nuota" is the third person singular form of the verb "nuotare," which agrees with the masculine singular noun "Francesco." Additionally, "a rana" is a prepositional phrase that describes how Francesco swims.	La frase è già corretta.
1	L'uso del verbo "raggiungere" con il pronome oggetto diretto "li" nella terza persona plurale è corretto in italiano. In questa frase, "li" si riferisce a persone o cose precedentemente menzionate nel discorso.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tutti bevono il the amaro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, "tutti" means "all," indicating multiple people or entities; "bevono" is the third person plural form of the verb "bere," meaning "to drink"; "il" is the definite article for singular masculine nouns; "the" is the definite article in English, which matches with "il" in this context; and "amaro" is an adjective that agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies, here being implied as "tea." Therefore, there are no errors in the given sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso afferra il gatto" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and uses proper singular verb conjugations for the third person masculine subject "Tommaso."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it could be more clear if it was written in the active voice instead of passive.	The gatto reflects on Alessandro. OR Alessandro thinks about the cat. (depending on what you want to convey) Note: In this case I am assuming that "Alessandro" is the subject and he is doing the reflecting, while "the cat" is the object being reflected upon. If this interpretation is incorrect, please let me know.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Andrea discusses the validity of Maria's statements. (if needed for confirmation)
1	The sentence "Riccardo fotografa Alice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian and all of the words are correctly conjugated and spelled.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso legge il giornale in salotto" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper prepositions to indicate location.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha visto una casa di mattoni rossi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper verb conjugation for the subject "Gabriele."	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "I libri vecchi stanno nella cassa" is grammatically correct because it uses the third person plural form of the verb "stare", which agrees with the subject "libri".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the right form of the verb "passare" to agree with the plural subject "un libro". Also, the preposition "da" indicates the starting point and "a" the ending point of the action, which makes sense in this context.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb should agree with the subject "la concordanza." In this case, it requires the third person singular form "c'è" instead of the plural form "ci sono".	No está bien. La corrección sería: "No siempre hay concordancia entre los hechos y las palabras en María."

1	The sentence "Emma has found the ring in the drawer" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with subject-verb agreement and proper word order.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The reflexive pronoun "se stesso" is correctly used to indicate that the action of lodging is performed by the subject of the sentence ("il meccanismo") on itself.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La scatola conserva le foto di Alessandro ed Edoardo.
0	The correct form of the verb "bere" after "io" should be "bevo". Also, the word "caffé" is masculine and singular, so it requires an article before it.	Io bevo un caffè. (or more informally: Un caffè lo bevo.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Maria gives burial to the father under a tree" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and word usage.

(Alternatively, "Maria buries her father under a tree.")
1	The sentence "La polizia sta sgombrando la piazza ai manifestanti." is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. Here, "sta" is used as an auxiliary verb to indicate that the action of clearing the square by the police is ongoing or continuous. Moreover, "ai" is correctly used with the singular noun "manifestante" which requires the use of "agli" when referring to multiple protesters ("ai manifestanti").	La polizia sta sgombrando la piazza ai manifestanti.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Uccidere" is the verb for killing someone, while "colpire" means to hit or strike something. In this context, it makes sense to say that Andrea killed Edward with one blow of a knife, as "sol colpo" indicates only one strike or action was involved.	Andrea uccise Edoardo con un sol colpo di coltello. (The sentence is already correct.)
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "I" should be "am", not "have".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Io sono qui."

Therefore, there are no errors or inconsistencies to point out.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it can be improved for clarity and fluency. "Innaffiatura" should not be repeated because it creates redundancy. Also, the phrase "with disinfestants" could be integrated better into the sentence to improve readability.	La frase è già corretta. However, an alternative way of expressing the same idea with more clarity would be: "Maria irrigua le piante con acqua contenente disinfestanti."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The use of the past tense "ha localizzato" indicates that the action was completed in the past, which is appropriate for describing an event that has already happened. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is correct, with "il radar" being singular and agreeing with "ha," also singular. Therefore, there are no errors to correct in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Alessandro difende Beatrice dai pericoli." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, "Alessandro" is the subject, which agrees with the third-person singular verb form "difende". This verb means "to defend", while "Beatrice" is the direct object that receives the action from the verb. Finally, we have the prepositional phrase "dai pericoli," where "dai" stands for "from" and "pericoli" refers to dangers or risks. Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "Alessandro defends Beatrice from dangers."	La frase è già corretta.
