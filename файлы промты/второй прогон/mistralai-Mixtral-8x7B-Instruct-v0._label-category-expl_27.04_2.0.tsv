0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it should be "Voglio salutare Giulia" instead of "Voglio di salutare Giulia". In this case, the preposition "di" is unnecessary and incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses the speaker's desire to greet someone named Sofia. No errors were found in morphology, syntax or semantics.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the determiner "my" does not agree with its noun phrase "the Divine Comedy." It should be "Il mio libro preferito è la Divina Commedia," where "libro" agrees with "mio" in number and gender.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it combines two different concepts - "my favorite train" and "Divine Comedy", which are not semantically related to each other.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of subject-verb-object and uses proper tense agreement between the subjects and verbs. Here, "Lorenzo" is the subject, "ha detto" is the verb, and "Andrea has spoken with Riccardardo" is the object clause. All three elements agree in number and person, making this sentence grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" is the subject of the sentence and the verb that agrees with it is "is". Since "Andrea" refers to one person, we use the singular form of the verb "to be", which is "is".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and all of the words are used appropriately.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "È ricomparso" is the third person singular form of the verb "ricompare", which agrees with the subject "il padre del ragazzo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "prices" agrees with the verb "are increased," and the tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, there are no obvious errors in word choice or syntax that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in morphology, syntax or semantics. "Salvatore" and "Andrea" are both proper nouns referring to people, so it makes sense for them to be the subjects of the sentence. "Ci siamo dati alla follia" is an idiomatic expression that means they engaged in wild behavior together. Overall, this sentence is understandable and does not contain any errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and has proper word order. "Il" is a singular masculine definite article that agrees with "palazzo," which is also singular. Therefore, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics in this sentence.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the word "that" should be "those" to agree with the plural noun "construction." The phrase "That construction" implies that only one instance of something offensive exists, but using "those" indicates multiple instances of an offense, which seems more appropriate given the context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Newton has explained the force of gravity" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. The subject "Newton" is singular and requires the third person singular present tense form of the verb, which is "has explained." Additionally, the object of the explanation ("the force of gravity") correctly follows the verb and agrees with it in number.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense verb "have" agrees with the plural subject "mi" (which refers to someone speaking about themselves in first person plural form) and "given" correctly describes the action of presenting an award to the speaker and its object is "the prize".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "to be" agrees with the singular noun "Tommaso."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "those men" agrees with the verb "have denounced." Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "themselves" correctly refers back to the subject of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means "I buy and read that book."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. It follows the standard structure of "Subject + Verb + Object" and conveys a clear meaning that the speaker met Lorenzo instead of Emma.
1	Correct	The sentence "The cat is on the mat." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and contains proper agreement between subject and verb. Here, the subject "cat" agrees with its singular present tense form of the verb "is". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "on the mat" correctly describes the location of the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" matches with the verb "have." Additionally, we use the possessive form of names to indicate possession, so "Riccardo's friends" means that these are friends belonging to or associated with Riccardo.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object and all words are used appropriately according to their meaning and function in this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a noun phrase "the big red apple," followed by the verb "was" and its subject complement "tempting." The tense of the verb agrees with the time frame of the sentence. Additionally, there are no apparent errors in word choice or syntax.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object pattern and uses proper verb tense agreement between the subject "Riccardo" and the auxiliary verb "ha." Additionally, possession is clearly denoted by using "propria," which agrees with its singular noun form "casa."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "has" and the object "his parents" follows the right possessive form of "his". Also, the idea expressed by the sentence is clear and understandable without causing any ambiguity or confusion.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "è". Additionally, the adverb "molto" correctly modifies the adjective "intelligent", and the word "intelligent" agrees in number with its subject "Riccardo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Credo" functions as an interjection here, expressing the speaker's opinion. It does not affect the subject-verb agreement or sentence structure, so it doesn't cause any errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of subject-verb-object and the verb "ha" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "was met" agrees with the subject "Andrea," and the passive voice construction is appropriate for the meaning conveyed by the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the word "da" should be replaced with "di" to correctly form a question asking about the subject of the verb "was seen." A possible correction would be: "Riccardo ha domandato **di** chi non era stato visto Leonardo," which translates to "Riccardo asked by whom Leo wasn't seen."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" matches with the verb "has been told", and the dependent clause "that he will speak tomorrow" correctly uses the third person singular pronoun "he".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb. In this case, the subject "Gabriele" requires a verb to form a complete thought or question. For example, a grammatically correct version of this question could be "Gabriele, when did you see him?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English question with a subject ("Leonardo") and an auxiliary verb ("has") followed by the past participle form of the main verb ("put"). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in which drawer" specifies where Leoanrdo put the papers.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks an appropriate form of the verb "to be" to connect with the subject "which politician." A corrected version could be: "Which politicians have spoken?" or "What politician has spoken?"
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically incorrect but it is semantically confusing and lacks necessary context to make sense. It contains multiple embedded relative clauses which makes it difficult to understand the main subject of the sentence and who exactly was talking on the radio. A clearer version of this sentence would be helpful for accurate evaluation.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules for statements. "Lorenzo" is the subject and "ha detto" is the verb indicating past tense action. The subordinate clause starting with "che" modifies the main clause by providing additional information about what Lorenzo said.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an independent clause with a subject "we" and a verb "could eat." The word "Francesco" functions as the adverbial time adjunct indicating when we could eat.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax, and semantics. Morphologically, each word has the appropriate ending or inflection to indicate its role in the sentence. Syntactically, the words are arranged in a way that conveys meaning clearly. Semantically, the sentence makes sense and expresses a complete idea.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement between the subject "chi" and the verb "tocca." Additionally, the idiomatic expression "to touch wires, one will die" maintains its meaning when translated into Italian as written.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence, which is followed by the conjunction "that", introducing the subordinate clause with the verb "has come". Then we have another conjunction "and", connecting two actions performed by Alessandro - he came to visit and told something. This construction is perfectly fine both syntactically and morphologically.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la commissione" matches with the verb "ritiene," and the object "il candidato" has the definite article "il" to agree in gender and number. Additionally, there are no obvious semantic errors or morphological issues that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object and the verb "is" agrees with its subject "the fear."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "ha", and the object "le chiavi" follows standard Italian syntax rules for expressing possession.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) with proper agreement between the subject and verb. "Alessandro" as the singular third person subject matches well with the third person present tense form of the verb "è". Additionally, there is an adjective phrase "bramoso di potere" which correctly modifies the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses the idea that the speaker thinks that Francesco is asking Lorenzo for the time. No morphological, syntactic or semantic errors can be detected in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. "Tommaso" is the subject and "ha affermato" is the verb phrase indicating that he made a statement or claim. Within this verb phrase, "ha" serves as the auxiliary verb to indicate past tense while "affermato" functions as the main verb. Additionally, "che" introduces a subordinate clause with "Edoardo parla," which maintains its own subject-verb agreement where "Edoardo" is singular and "parla" agrees with him. Overall, each component of the sentence fits together coherently without any morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense for the verb "have." Additionally, the conjunction "and" connects two like subjects ("I" and "John"), which takes the plural form of the verb "have" to agree with the subjects.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense agreement between the verb "has ordered" and its singular subject "Tommaso". Additionally, the indirect object ("Andrea") and direct object ("it", referring to being defended) are clearly identified with appropriate prepositions.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error present. "Il fatto di essere stato scoperto un delitto" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "ci ha sconvolti." Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable as native speakers would understand its meaning without confusion.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for English sentences. It has a clear subject "Alessandro" and a verb "will meet." Additionally, there is an implied question mark at the end since this appears to be a direct question rather than a statement.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the chair" matches with the verb "is", and there are no other errors related to morphology or semantics that would make it incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the relative pronoun "that" is correctly used to introduce a clause that describes the person whom Edward made the statement about and who Thomas spoke to. Additionally, the possessive form of the noun "person" agrees with its plural antecedent.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the dependent clause "chi Sophia abbia baciato" lacks a proper subordinating conjunction such as "that". A possible correction would be: "Edoardo believes that Sofia was kissed by someone."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the past tense of the verb "to see" should be "saw", instead of "have seen". So, the corrected form would be "Saw him." In English, we don't usually use auxiliary verbs with simple past forms to indicate the subject that performed an action, unlike some languages where this kind of construction exists and might cause confusion here.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because "lo" is a singular direct object pronoun and cannot be used to refer to multiple things or people. In this case, since "we" refers to more than one person, the proper form of the direct object pronoun should be "them". Therefore, the corrected version would be: "We have seen them."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense for the action verb "will speak". Additionally, the agreement between subjects and verbs is maintained throughout the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "Beatrice declared that she had nothing to do with Gabriele" instead of "Beatrice has declared that herself not have me anything to do with Gabriele". There are several issues with the original sentence including verb agreement errors and incorrect word order. Additionally, the phrase "herself not have" can be simplified to just "she had."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, "has said" is the verb phrase, and "that Andrea si è guardato" is a subordinate clause where "Andrea" is the object of the verb "guardare". There are no errors in agreement or tense that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and the structure of the sentence follows English syntax rules correctly. For example, "Il" agrees with its following noun "padre", which is masculine singular; "mi" is placed after the verb as an indirect object; and the sequence tense of the auxiliary verb "è" matches with the past participle form "parlato".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "thinks" agrees with its singular subject "Edoardo", and each subsequent clause correctly uses subjunctive mood to indicate uncertainty or possibility. Additionally, all subjects and verbs agree within their respective clauses.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject and verb of each clause agree with one another in number, and the dependent clauses correctly express that Edoardo believes something about what Emma wants, which in turn concerns what Tommaso will see. Additionally, there are no apparent issues with word choice or meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the rabbit" agrees with the verb "eats" and the meaning of the sentence is clear.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks an appropriate question word at the beginning to make it a coherent question. In this case, "which" or "what" would be suitable for asking about a specific book. Also, the phrase should specify whose professor and who are included in "have." For instance, the corrected version could be: "Which book does your professor recommend that we read?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Primo" can be used as an adverb meaning "before other people or things." Therefore, the sentence means that I arrived before you did.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for simple sentences with a subject ("A man") and a verb ("arrives"). The word "arrives" agrees with the singular subject "man," so there are no morphological errors present either.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" matches with the singular verb form "uccise", and both subject and verb agree in number. Additionally, the object of the sentence "Andrea" also agrees in number with the subject and verb. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" has an agreement with its verb "ha detto", and "Tommaso" as indirect object agrees with the pronoun "lo". Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear without any ambiguity or confusion.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "ha", and the meaning of the sentence is clear. Additionally, the phrase "di andare al mare" shows that Gabriele wants to go to the sea, which makes sense. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense. "Questo" agrees with the singular verb "è." Also, the clause "che non avevo mai letto" correctly modifies the noun "libro," clarifying which book specifically was not read before.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there should be a question mark at the end instead of a period to indicate that it is a question. Also, "from that professor" can be changed to "by that professor" for better clarity and grammar. A corrected version would be, "Hasn't Tommaso been questioned by that professor yet?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and the structure of the sentence follows English syntax rules correctly. "Alessandro" is the subject, "crede" is the verb, and "that," "invaderemo," and "quel paese" together form the object clause.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "crede" does not agree with its subject "qualche", which is plural but requires a singular verb form. Additionally, there should be an article before "paesi". A possible correction could be: "A proposito dei seguenti paesi, qual è quello che Andrea crede che invasserà?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax or semantics. A comma is used to separate two independent clauses and "today" is written as one word according to the American English style.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics. Actions described by the verbs "scrisse" and "ha ancora finito" refer to different points in time; therefore, past tense ("scrisse") and present perfect continuous tense ("ha ancora finito") are used appropriately for each action.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not semantically correct because the subject "Gabriele" cannot be both single and married at the same time. Each individual can only have one marital status.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the current king of France" is singular and agrees with the verb "is." Additionally, the predicate adjective "calvo," which means bald in English, correctly describes the noun it modifies.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Qualche studente" agrees with the verb "ha superato," and the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules. Additionally, there are no semantic or morphological errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rule of conditional sentences and negates both parts correctly to maintain logical consistency.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules for simple sentences. "I" is the singular first person pronoun and "promised" is its past tense form that agrees with the subject. The direct object of the verb is "Lorenzo", which comes after the verb as required by English syntax. Finally, an infinitive phrase "of parting" specifies what was promised to Lorenzo.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "dichiarò" agrees with its subject "la corte", and it uses past tense to indicate that the action occurred before another past event or time mentioned in the text. Additionally, the word "innocente" correctly describes the defendant as free from guilt or blame.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a noun phrase "the big red apple" which functions as the direct object of the sentence. It is modified by two adjectives "big" and "red", describing its size and color respectively. The verb "ate" agrees with the subject "Monkey", indicating that Monkey consumed something. Overall, this sentence describes a simple action involving an agent ("Monkey") and a patient ("the big red apple").
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho preso le chiavi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a conjugated verb and its object. In this case, "ho preso" is the first-person singular present indicative form of the verb "prendere," which means "to take." "Le chiavi" are the keys that serve as the direct object of the sentence. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in the phrase.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactic or semantic errors. The indirect speech is used correctly to report what the marchioness said.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "una bella casa" agrees with its verb "fa" and the adjective "comodo" correctly describes the house.
1	Correct	The sentence "The cat is on the mat." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for word order and agreement between subject and verb. The subject of the sentence, "cat," agrees with the singular present tense verb "is" and appears before the verb as required by basic SVO structure. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "on the mat" correctly modifies the location of "the cat".
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the form of the verb should be "use" instead of "ufo" to agree with the subject "I".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "funziona" agrees with its subject "il calcolatore," which are both singular. Additionally, the word "bene" correctly describes how well the calculator functions.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense of the verb "to be" ("were") to agree with the plural subject "my parents and I." Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules for forming sentences with multiple subjects connected by "and".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the girls" agrees with the verb "are" in number and tense.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the adverb "quickly" to modify the verb "reads".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a clear subject and the verb "have" does not agree with the implied singular subject ("I"). A grammatically correct version could be "I was going home and I met your brother."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" matches with the verb "am going," which agrees in number. Additionally, the infinitive phrase "to pick up the car" provides more information about what action the speaker is taking.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not semantically correct because the statement made is not logically valid. Places and faces are fundamentally different things and their appearance does not change in similar ways.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because it should be "Go home!" instead of just "Va' a casa!". In English, the verb "go" needs to agree with its subject in number and person, so when using the imperative mood for the second person singular or plural, no form of "to be" is needed before the main verb. However, Italian does require the use of "tu" or another appropriate pronoun along with the imperative form of the verb, which is "va'" in this case. Therefore, the corrected version would be "Vai a casa!" for addressing someone in the informal second person singular.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I" is the first person singular pronoun and it agrees with its verb "am". Additionally, "am" is an auxiliary verb used to form the present progressive tense of linking verbs like "to be", which expresses a state rather than an action in this case.
1	Correct	The sentence "Bravo, this guy." is grammatically correct. Although "bravo" is typically used to praise someone for an accomplishment, particularly in the context of performing arts, it can also be used more generally as an expression of approval or admiration. In this case, the subject being referred to with "this guy" seems to have done something that warrants such praise. Therefore, even if the use of "bravo" might sound unusual or informal depending on the situation and cultural conventions, its usage here does not constitute a syntactic error.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Paola" and a predicate "è una donna che apprezziamo molto". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about the speaker's plans for tomorrow.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" has seen the direct object "the book," and this action was performed with the help of an indirect object "you." Additionally, it includes the past tense marker "-ed" on the verb to indicate that the action occurred in the past.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb. A proper sentence should have at least one subject and one predicate (verb). In this case, "il cui" cannot function as the main verb of the sentence; therefore, an appropriate verb needs to be added. For example, "The friends whose teacher IS Andrea."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "I" matches the verb "credo," and the subordinate clause starting with "that" contains the verb "have." Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear and coherent.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not morphologically correct because the past participle "caduto" should agree with the subject "esso", but it doesn't. It should be "Così è caduto, si è fatto male."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses past tense consistently. Both subjects "they" and "she" are followed by appropriate verbs "wanted" and "had destroyed".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "Take their own coat" instead of "take his coat". The gender of the pronoun needs to agree with the gender-neutral antecedent "everyone", but "his" is masculine singular.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English syntax and morphological rules for forming sentences with transitive verbs. Here, "take" is a transitive verb that requires an object, which is provided by "that gadget." Additionally, there is no error in subject-verb agreement or pronoun reference.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for simple sentences in English. "I" gave "the boy" "milk," but "he" did not drink it. Each part of this sentence has a clear function that contributes to its overall meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence and there are no apparent errors in morphology, syntax or semantics. "Maria" is the singular subject of the first clause, and uses the verb "uses," while "I" am the singular subject of the second clause, using the negative form "don't know." There are two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "and."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" agrees with the verb "have," and the object "house" follows correctly after the verb. Additionally, the article "a" preceding "house" indicates that it is being introduced for the first time in this context, which is appropriate usage.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have seen your mother" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and has a clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the relative pronoun "that" has been dropped, which is acceptable in English when referring to people. A possible alternative with an explicit relative pronoun would be "The person that talked to me."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "uno" agrees with the verb "va", and the second part of the sentence correctly expresses what someone who travels by train usually wants. There are no morphological, syntactic or semantic errors that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence and uses proper verb agreement between the subject ("my head") and the verb ("hurts").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "I" and a predicate "have two houses." The verb "have" agrees with the singular first-person pronoun "I," so there are no morphological errors. There are also no syntactic or semantic issues that would make this sentence incorrect.

The verb "have" agrees with the singular first-person subject "I," so there are no morphological errors. Also, the word order is appropriate for an English declarative sentence, so there are no syntactical errors either. Finally, the meaning of the sentence is clear; therefore, it does not have any semantic issues.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the horse" agrees with the verb "has arrived", and the word order is appropriate for a simple English sentence expressing that an action was completed by the subject of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "cavalli" agrees with the verb "sono," both being plural, and the meaning of the sentence is clear and logical.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Someone" is a singular, third-person pronoun that can be either subject or object of a verb, and it fits the context here as an impersonal subject with the auxiliary verb "has." Therefore, "È venuto qualcuno" translates to "Somebody has come" in English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English declarative sentence with a subject ("It") and a verb ("has arrived"). There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Posso" is the first-person singular present indicative form of the verb "potere," which means "to be able to." In this case, it can be translated as "I can come." Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactic, or semantic errors in this sentence.

0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the reflexive pronoun "le" does not agree with the subject of the sentence. It should be "lo" if referring to "me." Additionally, there should be an article before "cappello," so it would read "The hat from me."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "quel ragazzo" agrees with the verb "apre" and the idea of opening the door is expressed clearly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for expressing an action performed by the subject on the object. In this case, "I" is the subject who has heard something, and "the boys singing" is the object being heard.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it lacks the appropriate form of the verb to be. It should be "The machine wants to wash it" instead of "The machine wants to wash him".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the mechanic" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "has." Additionally, the word order and agreement between other components of the sentence are also appropriate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "è" which refers to the infinitive verb phrase "venire fino a Napoli". Therefore, there is no need for an agreement between the subject and the negation particle "non", so it is placed after "è".
0	Morphology	The phrase is not correct because there is a missing article before "bath." In English, we usually say "the bathroom" or sometimes just "bathroom," but rarely simply "bath" on its own unless it refers to bathing as an activity. Therefore, the correction should be either "As for the bathroom, I am pleased" or "I am pleased with the bathroom."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English question and the proper noun "Lorenzo" has been introduced appropriately into the conversation.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires the addition of "has" or "have" after "does" to agree with the subject "he". A possible correction would be: "Does he live in America?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "Credi che sia possibile una cosa del genere?" follows the standard structure of an interrogative sentence in Italian and all words are correctly conjugated according to their respective genders and numbers.
0	Morphology	The verb form "detto" is incorrect for the past tense of the sentence. It should be "disse" to agree with the subject "mi". So, the correct phrase would be "Appena disse ciò, mi lasciò che piangevo e volevo dire molte cose."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses proper punctuation. Additionally, all words are correctly spelled and used appropriately within their context. This creates a complete thought that expresses an opinion about someone or something using positive descriptors such as "same," "fidated," "patient," and "honest." Overall, it effectively conveys a message of appreciation towards the person being described.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules and has a clear subject ("The strong wind on the sea") and predicate ("can cause storm surges"). Additionally, all words are used appropriately and agree with each other in terms of number and tense.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the adverb "forte" needs to be conjugated with an article or another determiner to agree in number and gender with the verb it modifies. In this case, we could use "molto" instead of "forte", which does not need any agreement, making the sentence grammatically acceptable. Thus, a corrected version would be "Piangere molto".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the speaker has taken in a type or kind of cat as a pet.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" matches with the verb "have" and the object "some sugar" makes sense in this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("I") and a predicate "don't like the wine." with the negation word "not" before the auxiliary verb "do".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "That" refers to something mentioned before and "which" introduces additional information about the antecedent. In this case, "that" correctly refers to "quel che vendo", which means "what I sell". Then, "which" introduces more details about "merce cinese", meaning "Chinese goods".
0	Morphology	The word "Mettere" is not grammatically correct because it should be either "meter" or "metes", depending on the intended meaning and tense. Additionally, there needs to be a subject before this verb form for the sentence to be complete.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that an competition has been prohibited or forbidden.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "tutte le balene" agrees with the verb "devono essere", and the meaning of the sentence is clear. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses proper punctuation. "You" is the subject of the sentence, and "puts" is the verb that agrees with the singular second person pronoun "you."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not semantically correct because the adjectives "vecchia" and "nuova" contradict each other when referring to the same object. An item cannot be both old and new at the same time.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" has an agreement with the verb "conosce", and the object of the sentence "Maria" is also correctly declined to match the verb tense. Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the present continuous tense "sta compilando" to indicate an ongoing action performed by the subject "Edoardo".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb. In this case, "emanate" should be used instead of just "emanare". Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is incorrect as "profumo" is singular but no corresponding third person singular form of the verb has been provided.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is a missing main verb. A helping verb such as "opens" or "is opening" needs to be added to make the sentence complete and grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It starts an activity or action and follows the subject-verb-object word order in English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence ("la porta"). It indicates that the action was performed by itself without any external agent.

All words are used appropriately according to their part of speech, and there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is the subject and "has returned" is the verb phrase indicating that Paola performed the action of returning something. In this case, it is specified that what she returned was "the book". Therefore, there are no errors regarding morphology, syntax or semantics, making the sentence entirely correct.
0	Morphology	The verb "to take" should be in past tense to agree with the time frame of the sentence. It should be "took" instead of "has taken." Therefore, the grammatically correct form is "What did he took?" However, this question still requires context because as it stands now, there doesn't seem to be an appropriate answer for that question since we don't know what specific action or object is being referred to by "what".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "le scarpe" agrees with the verb "si sono macchiate" in number and tense. Additionally, the article "le" correctly agrees with its feminine plural noun "scarpe."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Le" is the plural feminine definite article in Italian and it agrees with its nouns "giornate". The verb "si sono accorciate" is also grammatically correct as it shows that the subject of the sentence is plural and refers to something that can shorten such as days.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error present in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb. In this case "aggrapparsi" (cling) should be conjugated to agree with the subject of the sentence. A possible correction could be "Lui si aggrappa a un ramo." (He clings to a branch.)
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense for the action that took place in the past. "Arenate" functions as the past participle of the verb "to anchor," which agrees with its subjects "navi." Similarly, "sono scesi" correctly matches the plural form of the subject "equipaggi."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "has" agrees with its subject "fog," and the past participle "vanished" correctly describes the action taken by the fog.
0	Syntactic Role	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the reflexive pronoun "se" does not agree with its antecedent "Alessandro". In this case, the reflexive pronoun should be "si", making it "Alessandro si piagne sempre."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "si lagna." Additionally, there is no semantic or morphological error present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "Maria" matches with the verb "has nodded." Additionally, the word order follows standard English rules and there are no missing or extra words.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with the subject "l'acqua", which is singular in number and feminine in gender. Additionally, the word "sgorgata" correctly describes an action performed by water, agreeing with it in gender and matching its past tense form to that of the auxiliary verb used for the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Andrea" and a verb "has sbadigliato" which agrees with the subject in number. Also, it ends with a question mark indicating that it is an interrogative sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "pedala", and the ending of the verb matches its singular form. Additionally, there are no semantic or morphological issues that would make this sentence incorrect.
0	Morphology	The word "approfitto" is not a standard English word; the correct form is "take advantage of." Therefore, the sentence should read "He took advantage of the experience."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the elements are used appropriately according to their syntactic function and meaning. "Il figlio di Francesco" is the subject of the sentence, "si siede" is the verb and it agrees with the singular subject, "in prima fila" is an adverbial phrase indicating where the action takes place, and "alle 8 in punto" specifies when the action occurs.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules and there are no morphological or semantic errors present. In particular, "quando" is correctly used as a relative adverb to introduce a subordinate clause referring to time; "inizio" agrees with its subject "il concerto"; and "sedeva" agrees with its subject "il figlio".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it implies that the wall is getting moldy within a single day, which is unlikely and does not make much sense. This kind of error can be called semantic or pragmatic as well since there is nothing grammatically wrong with this sentence but its meaning is odd.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Paola" and a verb phrase "is playing". The direct object of the sentence is "a piece by Bach", which refers to a specific work written by Johann Sebastian Bach. The word order follows the standard English Subject-Verb-Object pattern.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il coro" agrees with the verb "canta" in number and person, and the adverb "molto" correctly modifies the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the verb form "aspirava", and the prepositional phrase correctly modifies the action of the verb. Additionally, the article "il" before "sigaro" agrees in gender and number with its noun head.

It has a subject ("Lorenzo"), an auxiliary verb ("did not") that agrees with the subject in number and tense, and a past participle form of the main verb ("cooked"). Additionally, there are no semantic errors or inconsistencies. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "The letter writes" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In this case, "the letter" is the subject, "writes" is the verb, and there isn't an explicit object in the sentence. However, if we consider the broader context where someone or something uses the letter to communicate, then using a pronoun like "it" as the object would be more appropriate: "The letter writes it." Nonetheless, the original sentence without the object is still acceptable according to English syntax rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have two cats and they are very playful." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax, and semantics. It has a clear subject ("I") and verb ("have"), with an adverbial phrase ("and they are very playful") that modifies the verb.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense to convey that Riccardo has not written for some time.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of the verb "to stop" agrees with the singular subject "the engineer." Additionally, the word order and punctuation are also correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires a verb to indicate the action being taken by the subject "the shopkeepers". In this case, since they have increased something, a possible correction could be "The shopkeepers have increased prices."

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" matches with the verb "ha acceso", and the object "il fuoco" follows the rules of Italian syntax. Additionally, the tense of the verb indicates that this action occurred in the past.

1	Correct	The sentence "La lezione ha continuato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement for Italian sentences where the verb "ha continuato" agrees with its singular feminine noun subject "la lezione." Additionally, the word order and tense are also appropriate for this context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Saltare un ostacolo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian imperative sentence with a verb and its direct object. In this case, "saltare" is the verb meaning "to jump," and "un ostacolo" is the direct object referring to "an obstacle."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Tutti" means "all" and it agrees with the verb "si sono commossi", which is in past participle form and matches the gender and number of "tutti".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "si è macchiata" agrees with its singular feminine subject "la tovaglia."
0	Morphology	The form of the verb "macchiare" should be "macchia" when used with the third person singular subject "il vino". It is incorrect to use the infinitive form after the subject. Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Il vino macchia."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with its subject "l'acqua," and the time expression "in two hours" correctly indicates how long it takes for the action to occur.
0	Morphology	The verb "have" should be conjugated to match the past tense of the sentence; it should be "has" instead because the subject "tapes" is singular and requires a singular auxiliary verb. A correct version would be "The tape has burned for an hour."
1	Correct	The sentence "Il vetro si rompe" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian independent clause with a singular third-person subject and a reflexive verb that agrees in number and gender with its subject. In this case, "il vetro" is a masculine singular noun, and "si rompe" is a third-person singular reflexive verb meaning "it breaks." Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense of the verb "to verify" ("has verified") and refers to an unknown subject who performed this action on an unspecified signature. However, without more context it's difficult to say for certain if the intended meaning is being conveyed accurately.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax, and semantics. The subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "si è tagliato," which indicates that the action was performed by one person. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "con il rasoio" correctly describes the instrument used to perform the action. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Both "si è calmato" and "irrigidito" are past participle forms of the verbs that agree with the singular subject "Francesco".
1	Correct	The sentence "Si è rotto il vetro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a compound subject and a reflexive verb conjugated correctly to match the third person singular masculine or feminine gender of the subject.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper verb tense to connect the subjects "you" and the infinitives "come", "eat", and "drink". It should be "Come to the party, eat and drink."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "is" agrees with its subject "debate," which is singular. Additionally, the present participle "continued" correctly follows and modifies the subject of the sentence to indicate ongoing action.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "has continued" agrees with its subject "the debate," and there are no other obvious errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics.

1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo suona il telefono." is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "suona", and the object "il telefono" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, all words are properly conjugated for tense, number, and gender.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "rise" is "rose", but its adjective form can be used as "leveled up". Therefore, "the level has leveled up" or "the level has increased" are also possible and correct alternatives to express this idea.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Francesco" matches with the singular verb form "has." Additionally, there are no apparent issues with word order or agreement between words within the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses past participle "pentito" correctly to indicate that the action of regretting happened in the past. The subject "Edoardo" is singular and matches with the verb "è".

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense verb "si è asciugata" agrees with its singular subject "la biancheria."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. The verb "è" agrees with its singular subject "Il libro", and the adverbs "improvvisamente" and "suddenly" are correctly placed to modify the verb. Additionally, the prepositional phrases "per tre giorni" and "sul mio tavolo" provide additional information about when and where the book reappeared. Overall, this sentence demonstrates good control of basic Italian grammar structures.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense for the past action of "ingrassare" which means to gain weight or fatten up.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Tommaso" and a verb "has ingrassato". The adverb "molto" modifies the verb phrase "has ingrassato", and "dall'ultima volta che l'ho vista" is an adverbial clause that tells us when this change occurred.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires the use of an auxiliary verb "to be" after "si" to form the passive voice or indicate past tense for the subject "la televisione". In this case, the appropriate usage would have been either "Si è rotta la televisione" meaning "The television got broken" or "La televisione si è rotta in un'ora" meaning "The television broke in an hour."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the elements are used appropriately according to their meaning and function in this context. "Alle 8 in punto" means at eight o'clock sharp; "la sala" refers to a room or hall; and "si è svuotata" describes that it became empty. Therefore, there is no morphological, syntactical nor semantic error in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the reflexive pronoun "si" cannot be used with the singular form of the verb "è." Instead, one should use the third person singular form "é," or if referring to multiple trains, the third person plural form "sono." Therefore, an acceptable correction would be either "Il treno si è un po' fermato" (if there was only one train) or "I treni si sono un po' fermati" (if there were multiple trains).

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all words are used appropriately in context.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Chi" (who) does not agree with the verb "ama" (loves). In English, it would be something like "Who loves?" instead of "Who love?". A correct form could be for example "Chi ama Leonardo?" (Who does Leo love?) or "Leonardo, chi ama?" (Leo, who do you love?).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Francesco" matches with the singular verb "è", and the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules for declarative sentences. Additionally, there is no semantic ambiguity or logical fallacy present that would detract from the overall coherence of the statement.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the weight of thirty kilograms is being measured or has been measured by Alexander.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object and the verb "has sold" agrees with its singular subject "my grandfather". Additionally, the possessive pronoun "his" correctly modifies the noun "farm", and the article "the" precedes both "his" and "farm." Overall, this sentence does not contain any morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the phrase "two languages are spoken" implies that each of your students speaks two languages. A more accurate way to express this idea would be: "All my students speak two languages."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Otto ore al giorno" is the object of the verb "studied," and "Tommaso" is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.

Additionally, there are no morphological or semantic errors present that would make the sentence incorrect.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks an auxiliary verb to form a question. It should be "Where did Riccardo put the box in the cabinet?" instead of "Dove Riccardo mise la cassa nel mobile?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because "lo" is a singular masculine direct object pronoun that refers to "scoglio," and "affiora" is an intransitive verb which does not need an object. Therefore, the subject of this sentence is "lo scoglio," and it agrees with the verb form "affiora."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable as it stands. "Andrea" is the subject of the sentence and "si comporta" is the verb phrase indicating that Andrea is behaving or acting in some way.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "sottrae" does not agree with its subject "Leonardo". In English, this would be as if we said "Leonardo subtracts the pen", which is also incorrect and should be "Leonardo takes/uses the pen." Therefore, a grammatically correct version of the original Italian sentence could be "Leonardo toglie la penna."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" matches with the verb "toglie", and there are no other errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "leggere", and the preposition "a" correctly introduces the location where the action takes place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules and has appropriate verb tense agreement between the subject "Riccardo" and the verb "beve". Additionally, the article "il" preceding "the" indicates that this may be an Italian name, but it does not affect the overall grammaticality of the sentence within the context provided here.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there should be an auxiliary verb ("does" or "has") before "have" to form the question correctly. A possible correction would be: "Where has Andrea taken a cigarette?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for simple sentences in English. "Tommaso" is the subject and "estrarre" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject. Additionally, the preposition "nel" introduces the location where the action takes place, which is common in this type of sentence structure.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the pronoun "ci" requires that the verb be in its third person singular form ("mangia") instead of its third person plural form ("mangiano"). Therefore, the correct version would be "Riccardo ci mangia il riso."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires "s" at the end of the verb "vi supporta" to agree with its plural subject "Tommaso". A correct version could be: "Tommaso vi supportano."

Additionally, the prepositional phrase "sul ripiano del montacarichi" provides necessary context for understanding where the action of putting takes place.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "toglie", and the action described by the verb is clear and makes sense. Additionally, we can infer that "the drawer" refers to a physical object from which money is being removed. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La" means "the" and "chiave" means "key." Together they mean "The key," which implies that the key fits into or operates something called a "toppa." Without more context it is difficult to say exactly what this refers to, but based on the provided information there are no grammar errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" agrees with the verb "has planted," and the object of the preposition "from" ("giardino") correctly comes before the object of the preposition "to" ("strada").

Additionally, there is no semantic inconsistency or ambiguity that would make it incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the verb "carica", and the object of the verb "le casse" follows correctly after it. Also, there is an appropriate preposition "sulla" before "nave".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "scale" agrees with its verb "ponges," and the prepositional phrase correctly modifies the action of the verb. Additionally, the article "the" before "wall" indicates that it refers to a specific wall, which is appropriate for this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of English syntax and morphology. "I revoltists" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "incarcerated," and "Gabriel" is the direct object. There are no obvious semantic errors either.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" matches with the verb "chiuse", and the object "il denaro" follows standard Italian syntax rules for sentence structure.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of "dare" ("dette") agrees with the subject "Gabriele," and "appoggio" as a direct object correctly follows "diede." The meaning of the sentence is also clear and coherent, indicating that there are no semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence and "dette appoggio" is the verb phrase in past tense indicating what Alessandro did. The clause "alla diffusione del libro" describes where or to whom Alessandro gave his support.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense verb "caricò" agrees with its singular subject "Lorenzo". Additionally, the direct object of the sentence "il camion" follows standard Italian word order and agreement rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of syntax and semantics. "Questo" is a singular masculine demonstrative adjective agreeing with its noun "latte". "Deterge" is a third-person singular verb that agrees with its subject "il latte", meaning "it cleanses." The prepositional phrase "dalle impurità dal volto" correctly modifies the verb "deterge," indicating what kind of impurities ("impurities") on what part of the body ("dal volto").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "stipò", and the object of the preposition "with" has an appropriate form ("i vestiti"). All words are used appropriately according to their morphological forms; there are no semantic or syntactic errors that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "stanno" agrees with the subject "la fotografia di Giulia e quella di Lorenzo," which is plural. Additionally, the preposition "attaccate" indicates that the photographs are physically connected or adjacent to each other. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the pronoun "la" is incorrectly used as the object of both verbs "allontanò" and "l'una all'altra." It should be "Paola e la finestra l'una dall'altra," making it clear that "la" refers to the window.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Francesco" matches with the verb "avvolge", and the object of the preposition "in" has an article that agrees with it ("una tela").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "accompagna", and the object of the preposition "al" is correctly placed before it. Additionally, the indirect object "Sofia" follows the verb as expected.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "accompagnò" and the object "Paola" is correctly linked to the destination of the action by the preposition "a". Additionally, the direct object "scuola" also follows the expected pattern for this type of sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "The books are not in the closet" instead of "I libri non stano nell'armadio." In Italian, you need to use "stare" when referring to something being temporarily located somewhere and "essere" for permanent location. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is incorrect as the verb "stare" does not agree with its plural subject "libri".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "attraversò", and the definite article "il" correctly precedes the adjective "meno" which modifies the noun "parte". Additionally, the preposition "del" introduces the possessive relationship between "fiume" and "parte."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses the speaker's intention to dress up as a bride.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and uses proper verb tense agreement between "Francesco" as the subject and "mangiava" as the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quella mattina pioveva a dirotto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. The subject "quella mattina" agrees with the singular verb form "pioveva," indicating past tense and third person singular agreement. Additionally, the adverbial phrase "a dirotto" modifies the verb appropriately. Therefore, there are no apparent errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "bebere" does not agree with its subject "il vino." In English, it would be as if we said "The wine drinks Alexander," instead of "The wine is drunk by Alexander." So the corrected version should be: "Il vino è bevuto da Alessandro."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement for each clause and has appropriate punctuation to separate two independent clauses. In this case, "Francesco" is singular with corresponding verb "ha telefonato", while "Maria" is also singular with its own verb "è venuta". Each of these verbs agrees with their respective subjects, making both clauses independently correct as well as collectively when connected by "and." Additionally, there is proper punctuation separating the two clauses which makes them conjoined independent clauses rather than one complex sentence or run-on sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of subject-verb-object and uses proper tense agreement between the verb "was given" and its past participle form "given." Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to Paula from Gabriel" correctly specifies who gave the book to whom.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with the subject "Paola" and the predicate "receives that book from Riccardo". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "mangia", and the object of the preposition "un polpo" correctly follows the proposition "un". Additionally, the article "un" before "polpo" indicates that it refers to one specific octopus rather than multiple ones.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense for the verb "mangia" which agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso". Also, the definite article "questo" refers to something specific that Tommaso is eating.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule and has a clear meaning. "Sofia" is the singular subject of the sentence, and "adora" is the corresponding verb that agrees with the number of the subject.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because arthritis cannot paralyze bones. Arthritis refers to inflammation and stiffness of the joints, not weakness or paralysis of bones.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the indirect object "lo" needs to be combined with the verb to form "want to eat it" instead of just "want to eat". So the corrected version would be "Maria wants to eat it."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" matches with the verb "ammira" and agrees in number. Also, the object of the sentence "Alice" correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and "la" refers to someone or something that Riccardo admires.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the verb form "mira", and the preposition "to" correctly introduces the goal of the action expressed by the verb. Additionally, the article "la" agrees in gender and number with its noun "presidenza".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "salta" and the adverbial phrase "sul letto" correctly modifies the action of jumping.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires the word "è" instead of "è" to agree with the singular subject "Edoardo". A corrected version would be: "È subito che Eduardo vuole il caffè."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "È" does not agree with the verb tense of the predicate "ciò che Tommaso tiene". It should be "Essere al successo è ciò che Tommaso tiene." for proper agreement and syntax structure.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" matches with the verb "mira", and the preposition "to" is correctly used before the noun phrase "alla presidenza". Additionally, there are no apparent errors in morphology or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "adora". Additionally, the object of the sentence, "the cinema", is correctly identified by an article and in its plural form as expected for this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "il cinema" and the verb that agrees with it is "adora". Therefore, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "Il" is a singular masculine definite article that agrees with "cinema," which is also singular and masculine. Similarly, "la" is a singular feminine definite article that agrees with "musica." Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence as "è" matches with both "il cinema" and "la musica". Therefore, there are no semantic or syntactic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the teeth of Emma" agrees with the verb "battono," and the phrase as a whole makes sense semantically.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is no verb connecting "Alessandro" and the phrase "that they love long-legged women." A possible correction could be "Alessandro loves that they have long legs, women."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the pronoun "ne" does not agree with its antecedent "Andrea." It should be either "he or she" instead of "ne." Additionally, the preposition "of" is missing between "adores" and "Emma's friends," making the sentence sound awkward and hard to understand. A corrected version would be: "Andrea adores Emma's friends."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "mangia," and the object "un gelato" follows standard Italian syntax rules for word order and agreement with the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and a verb ("promises") in the present tense, as well as an object ("that he will come"). Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "himself" correctly refers back to the subject "Riccardo".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because an octopus cannot be eaten by a person; it is the other way around.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the preposition "ne" does not agree with its antecedent "tolerance." It should be replaced by a possessive form such as "its" to make the sentence syntactically correct. A possible correction would be: "Tolerance excludes it from its duties."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "ci viene" agrees with it in number and person. The location from which he comes is expressed by the city "Roma".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" matches with the verb "pensa" and the object of the sentence, which is "Paola", follows correctly after it. Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" agrees with the verb "accompagna" and the object "Maria." Also, the destination of the action is introduced by the preposition "in," followed by the name of the country "Cina." There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "si sono visti" agrees with the subject "Emma and the film" which is plural. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "si" is used correctly to indicate that both Emma and the film saw themselves or each other.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject of the main clause and his action is to admire something, which is expressed by the verb "admires." The object of the main clause is "the house," which is modified by the relative clause "that is of Paola." This relative clause has as its antecedent "the house," and it indicates that the house belongs to someone named Paola. So overall, the structure and word choice are all appropriate here.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it implies an impossible or unlikely action. A person cannot "absorb" another person; this concept goes against our understanding of the world and violates semantic rules.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "distributes" does not agree with its subject "Lorenzo". In English, verbs must match their subjects in number (singular or plural). Here, "Lorenzo" is singular and requires a third-person singular form of the verb, which should be "distributes" instead of "distribuites". Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be: "Lorenzo distributes bricks."
1	Correct	The sentence "Che Riccardo dipinga è bello" is grammatically correct. Although it might seem like something is missing or incorrect because of the word order, this is actually an example of a cleft sentence in Italian. In English, it would be equivalent to saying "What is beautiful is that Riccardo paints."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" agrees with the verb "passeggia", and the singular form of the verb is used appropriately to match the singular subject. Additionally, the preposition "per" is correctly followed by its object "Venezia".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "raccoglie", and both are singular; also, the object of the sentence "sassolini" correctly follows the verb and agrees in number.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Emma" and the verb "umilia" agree in number (singular) and the action expressed by the verb can be logically associated with the subject of the sentence. Additionally, the object "Edoardo" also agrees in number (singular) with the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il fulmine" matches with the singular verb form "cadde". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "di Andrea" correctly describes who the lightning struck.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("fa") and a predicate ("neve"). "Fa" is the third person singular form of the verb "fare", used here impersonally to indicate that it is snowing.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "dormicchia" and the prepositional phrase "nell'inazione più totale" correctly modifies the verb.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because mayonnaise cannot take or accept anything; it is an inanimate object and cannot perform actions that require cognition or volition. A possible correction could be "The mayonnaise didn't turn out well" or "The mayonnaise went bad."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" has a verb-subject agreement with the verb "sorride", and the object of the preposition "to" is correctly used to indicate who or what is being smiled at.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "a star" matches with the singular verb "shines," and the prepositional phrase "in the sky" correctly modifies the location of the action.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "a star" matches with the singular verb form "shines," and the object "the sky" correctly follows the preposition "in." Additionally, the article "a" before "star" indicates that it refers to any random star, not specifically one previously mentioned.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that there is one star twinkling in the sky.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "scintilla" agrees with its singular subject "Il vestito." Additionally, the prepositional phrase "di uno stupendo diamante" correctly modifies "il vestito."
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice burns with passion" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and the verb agrees with its singular subject. Additionally, all words are used appropriately and there are no semantic inconsistencies or missing elements.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "luccicava", and the tense of the verb is appropriate for past events. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "dall'emozione" correctly modifies the subject by providing further information about its emotional state.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "that idea" agrees with the verb "fades," and the meaning of the sentence is clear and coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is the subject and "vi ritorna" is the verb phrase. It means that "Gabriele is returning to you."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "giunge" and the preposition "in" followed by "casa" correctly indicates where the action of arriving takes place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. "The scale" is the subject of the sentence, and "descends" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject. There are no apparent morphological or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "arrives" agrees with its subject "the path." Additionally, the word order and word choice are appropriate for standard English usage.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the subject "La Maggioranza" is plural and requires a verb conjugated for third person plural, but instead it uses the singular form "patteggia". It should be "La maggioranza patteggia CON l'opposizione" or "La maggioranza pattuisce UNA pace con l'opposizione", depending on the intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Emma" is the subject of the sentence and she is engaged in a struggle which is indicated by the verb phrase "lotta su". The prepositional phrase "on this point" further clarifies what the struggle is about.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "taglia" and the object "il pane a fette" is correctly formed.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and it is doing an action ("saw") on an object ("the face").

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of its parts are used appropriately according to their meaning in context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Tommaso" and a verb "ha edificato", which agrees with the subject in number and person. There are no morphological or semantic errors either. Therefore, it can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" and verb "is" agree in number, and the adjective "brutal" correctly describes how the subject "Andrea" interacts with the object "Alice".
0	History	The sentence is grammatically correct but the statement itself may not be historically accurate. Japan did invade and occupy Manchuria for several years, but it was more of an invasion than a formal colonization process.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that Leonard had stacked packages at the bottom of the bookshelf.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the past participle "ammassato" needs to agree with its subject "Leonardo". Since "Leonardo" is singular, "ammassato" should be replaced by "ammasstò", which is the past tense of the verb "ammassare" and agrees with a masculine singular subject. Therefore, the grammatically correct form would be: "Leonardo had amassed against the wall."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Lorenzo" is the subject and he performed the action "had amassed" on "packages", which are the objects of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "The miser hoards wealth." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of subject-verb-object and all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech. In this case, "the miser" serves as the subject, "hoards" acts as the verb, and "wealth" functions as the object. Therefore, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" matches with the third person singular verb form "is", and there are no other errors related to morphology or syntax that would make this sentence unacceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "The Sergeant" matches with the verb "distributes", and the direct object "the soldiers" correctly follows it. Additionally, there are no capitalization or word form errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics. "Sofia" is the subject, "separated" is the verb, and "the work" is the direct object, while "in two distinct parts" serves as an adverbial phrase modifying how the action was performed.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Paola" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "carezzò." * "gli" is a pronoun that refers to a male singular person and serves as an indirect object. It agrees with the direct object "il volto." * The action of caring for someone or something involves touching gently, which fits the context here. Therefore, there are no semantic errors either.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The word "this" refers to a situation that is making things difficult for him.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Maria" and an action "afferrò". "La mano di Lorenzo" is the direct object of the verb "afferrò". All words are used correctly according to their morphological forms, and they build up a syntactically correct structure with clear semantic roles for each participant in the described event.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "this medicine" agrees with the verb "coagulates", and the object "the blood" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, the article "the" preceding "blood" indicates that it refers to specific blood rather than blood in general, which is appropriate given the context of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "forgia," and the object "l'acciaio" correctly follows the transitive verb "forgia." Additionally, the article "l'acciaio" appropriately uses an article to indicate a specific piece of steel.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence and all words are used correctly in context.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the verb "partoriscono" does not match with its subject "le donne". In English, it would be like saying "The women give birth to the children." which is incorrect since the verb should be "give birth" instead of just "give". A more accurate translation for the Italian sentence could be "Le donne danno alla luce i bambini", where "danno alla luce" correctly translates to "give birth".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" matches with the verb "converte", and the object "lo zucchero" follows the right agreement rules. Also, there is a clear relationship between the elements of the sentence making it semantically accurate as well.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the government" and the verb "converts" agree in number, and the meaning of the sentence is clear without any ambiguity or confusion.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the direct object pronoun "ne" does not agree with its antecedent "Francesco". In this case, since "Francesco" is singular and masculine, the correct form of the direct object pronoun should be "lo" instead of "ne". So, the corrected sentence would be: "Alice lo travestì."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the verb "liberò", and the object of the sentence "il cane" correctly follows the article "il". Additionally, the past tense form "liberò" agrees with the third person singular subject "Riccardo."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the subject "lo Stato" (the State) does not agree with the verb "accorda" (grants). In this case, it should be "accordano" to match the singular subject. Additionally, there might also be an issue of word choice as "troppa" implies too much of something specific that was mentioned before and since nothing has been specified earlier, using just "molta" would make more sense here.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" matches with the verb "attribui", and the preposition "to" correctly introduces the indirect object "Leonardo". Additionally, the clause "of going to China" adds more information about the decision that was attributed to Leonardo. Overall, this sentence presents no morphological, syntactical or semantic issues.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. Additionally, the verb "addebitava" agrees with its singular subject "Leonardo." There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Morphology	The verb "abbandona" does not agree with its subject "Francesco". It should be "abbandona" instead of "abbandona" to match the singular form of the subject. Corrected sentence: "Francesco abbandona sua moglie sulla strada."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word usage. "I ladri" are the subjects and they are plural, so "rubano" which is also plural is used as the verb. Additionally, the objects "le auto" and "ai legittimi proprietari" provide more context to who or what is being stolen by the thieves. Overall, this sentence describes an action that has been completed with certainty, making it clear and concise.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects and verbs agree with each other in number, and there are no apparent errors in morphology or semantics. Specifically, "Maria" is singular and so is "spalmò," while "il pane" and "con il coltello" are prepositional phrases that correctly modify the verb.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because "di" should be replaced with "il", which is the correct definite article for masculine singular nouns like "tavolo". Additionally, there seems to be confusion between two different prepositions; it appears that "of" or "about" might have been intended instead of "di", but without more context, it's difficult to determine if this change would make the sentence grammatically accurate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses appropriate tense and word forms. "L'aviazione" is the subject, which takes the third person plural form of the verb, "bombardò", agreeing with its number. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "sulla città" correctly describes where the action occurred.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because "imbevere" means to soak or drench something, usually with water, and it doesn't make sense for someone to soak bread in wine. A more appropriate verb would be "bagnare" or "intingere". So the corrected version could be: "Andrea bagna/intinge il pane nel vino."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Raso rosso" agrees with the verb "foderava" in number and tense. Also, the object of the preposition "i" correctly refers to "cuscini".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" agrees with the verb "dissemmina," and the prepositional phrase "in his stories" correctly modifies the verb. Additionally, the adjective "funny" describes the noun "anecdotes."
0	Morphology	The verb "disseminate" is incorrect because it does not agree with the subject "tourists". A correct form would be "the tourists scatter", giving us "The tourists scatter the lawn with litter."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the object of "nutrí" should be a noun instead of an idea, which is abstract and cannot be fed. Also, the clause "of being the best and most intelligent one of all" does not make sense as it seems to describe what was fed but lacks clarity and coherence. It would require rephrasing for better understanding.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the verb "liberò", and the object of the preposition "dalle" has an appropriate article "le". Additionally, the past tense form "liberò" agrees with the third person singular subject "Riccardo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" is singular and the verb "scarica" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the preposition "dalle" correctly takes the plural form of the possessive adjective "proprie." Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is the subject and "ne obtains liberty" is the predicate of the sentence. In this case, "ne" is used as a pronoun referring to something mentioned before, indicating that Tommaso gets some form of freedom or liberation previously discussed.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects and verbs are conjugated properly based on their number agreement, and there are no apparent semantic errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it uses the archaic "makes that" construction instead of the more common "makes" or "turns." In addition, there should be an article before "lead," so the corrected version would read either "The alchemist makes gold derive from lead" or "The alchemist turns lead into gold."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "spostò" in number and tense, and there is a clear relationship between the objects "il cappello", "l'armadio" and "al tavolo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "pone" and the object "il libro" correctly follows the action of the verb. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase "sulla scrivania" that describes where the action takes place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper tense agreement between the subject "Alessandro" and the verb "prese". Additionally, all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech and meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "spedì" and the object "la ricevuta" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, the indirect object "all'ufficio delle imposte" is also placed appropriately after the direct object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" and the verb "pushed" agree in number (singular) and all nouns have their corresponding articles or determiners ("le" before "gambe", "la" before "parete"). Additionally, the preposition "of" is correctly used to indicate possession between "the legs" of "Francesco".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Foresteria" is a singular noun that means guesthouse or lodging house and "ospita" is the verb in third person singular form which agrees with the subject of the sentence "la foresteria".

Additionally, the subordinate clause "that everything works to perfection" is correctly introduced by the conjunction "that", and it contains an infinitive phrase ("to work") that functions as the object of the subordinate clause.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "approves," and the subjunctive mood is used correctly to express a suggestion or action that has not yet occurred. Additionally, the clause "that Maria parta" uses the singular form of the verb "partire" to agree with the singular subject "Maria." Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper morphological agreement between subjects and verbs as well as syntactically correct use of the subjunctive mood.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "dubits" requires a direct object complement to complete the thought. Also, the preposition "of" should be followed by a clause or noun phrase, but here it is followed by a pronoun ("che"). A possible correction could be "Emma doubts that Alice will leave."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject-verb agreement rule has been violated. "Che Lorenzo" and "Tommaso" are both third person singular masculine nouns; therefore, the verb should be conjugated as such. A possible correction could be "Che Lorenzo viaggio angoscia Tommaso." However, even with this change, the sentence would still lack clarity since it is unclear what specifically about Lorenzo's travel causes distress to Tommaso.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks the necessary verb to connect "Riccardo" and "the idea". A possible correction could be "Riccardo approves this idea."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject and he approves ("lo approva") of something that Maria ("che Maria") does, which is singing ("canti"). All verbs agree with their subjects in number and person, so there are no morphological errors. Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules. Therefore, this sentence can be classified as grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks an auxiliary verb to form the question correctly. It should be "Does Sofia want to come?" or "Sofia wants to come."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb should be "fuma" instead of "al fumo". In this case, "al" is an incorrect preposition and there shouldn't be any article before the noun as it would require the use of the gerund form ("andare al fumetto", for example). So, the grammatically correct version would be "Riccardo fuma."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming a simple sentence with a subject and a verb. "Alice" is the subject, and "brama" is the verb. Additionally, the phrase "di tornare" functions as an infinitive complement of the verb "brama".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the infinitive marker "to" should be used after "encourage". It should be "Andrea encourages Maria to get married."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English clause with a subject ("The fact that Emma talks") and a predicate ("allieta suo father"). Additionally, "that" introduces a subordinate clause which functions as the direct object of the main verb "allieta". Therefore, there are no apparent morphological, syntactic or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "inflames" agrees with its subject "going to the cinema," and it correctly conveys that this action has an exciting effect on Sofia.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "La colpisce" requires a third-person singular verb for agreement. In this case, it should be "colpiscE".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for simple sentences in English. "Beatrice" is the subject, and "is" is the linking verb that agrees with the singular subject. Additionally, the adjective "svestita" describes the state or condition of the subject. Overall, this sentence conveys a complete thought through proper syntactical structure.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject of the second clause "Leonardo" does not agree with the verb that follows it "ride". It should be "Leonardo amuses himself because Maria is laughing." or something similar to maintain the original meaning and make the sentence grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la tristezza e la noia" agrees with the verb "deprimono", and the object "Gabriele" follows correctly after the verb. Additionally, the word order is also appropriate for an Italian sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the verb "mi acquieta" which means "it soothes me", and it agrees with its singular subject "che". The clause "Giulia parli in questo modo" is a subjunctive mood that indicates uncertainty or doubt. This usage is common when expressing emotions or reactions towards something uncertain or not certain to happen.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the presence of Alice alone has a calming effect on me or the speaker.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "talking to the dancers" agrees with the verb "is", and the word order follows standard English rules for forming sentences. Additionally, there are no apparent errors in morphology or semantics that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "I" matches with its verb "come". Also, the word "fascinated" agrees with the subject "I", and the prepositional phrase "by the fact that Edward spoke about poetry" correctly modifies the verb to add more detail about what specifically the speaker finds fascinating.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "di" should be replaced with "vedere" to form the correct verb tense. Also, there should be an article before "Paola." A possible correction would be: "Vedere i marziani le successe a Paola."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the connection between winning the lottery and someone's gaze shining is not clear without additional context. It is necessary to provide more information or rephrase the sentence for it to be semantically acceptable.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is a missing subject before the verb "splendeva". A possible correction could be: "The fact that she had won the lottery was shining in her gaze."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it lacks the verb "to be" or another appropriate verb to connect the subject and the infinitive. A possible correction could be: "We have to run away."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "flee" does not agree with its subject "it". In this case, "it" refers to "the thought", which is singular and requires a third-person singular form of the verb, such as "flees." Therefore, it should be "It flees," instead of "It fugge."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The use of "Emma" as the subject and "è" followed by the past participle form "uscite" correctly indicates that the subject is singular. Additionally, there is no ambiguity regarding meaning; the intended interpretation is clear.
0	Morphology	The verb "condannavo" should be used instead of "condanno" because the action happened in the past tense according to the given information about Herod killing children.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" and the verb "adora" agree in number (singular) and tense (present). Additionally, the object of the verb, "Andrea," also agrees with the verb in number (singular). Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" matches with the verb "intends," and the object of the verb is clear ("to marry Alice"). There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the third person singular verb form "evita". Additionally, there are no other morphological or semantic errors present in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks an auxiliary verb to form the present progressive tense with the subject "Paola" and the adjective "carino". It should be "Paola thinks that it is nice." or "Paola believes we are leaving is nice.", depending on context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "Lorenzo" is the subject and he thinks that "Alice" is someone else, which turns out to be "Paola". So it means "Lorenzo thought Alice was Paola", making the sentence correct syntactically as well as semantically.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the word "that" is needed between "judica" and "Maria". Also, the verb should agree with its subject in number and person, so it should be "lo giudica" instead of "giudica" since the subject "Beatrice" is singular and feminine. Additionally, the phrase "troppe amanti" implies that Maria has too many female lovers, while using "amanti" for a female character would mean male lovers. To avoid confusion, one could say "troppi corteggiatori" or simply "tanti amici", regardless of gender.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "giudica" does not agree with its subject "Sofia". It should be "Sofia lo **giudica** Maria che abbia troppe amanti." or "Sofia lo **valuta** negativamente poiché Maria ha troppi amanti.", depending on the intended meaning of the original sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for an English declarative sentence. "Giulia" is the subject and "lo giudica" is the verb phrase; "evidente" is an adjective modifying "che"; "che Maria sia bella" is a subordinate clause acting as the direct object, where "che" introduces the clause and "Maria" is the subject with the singular verb form "sia."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of English language sentences. "Leonardo" is the subject and "supposes" is the verb. The indirect object "il father" and adverb clause "that he drinks too much" provide additional information about what LeoSuppono. Good job!
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "think" should be conjugated to agree with the subject "I". In this case, it should be "I think something of you." Instead, there is no auxiliary verb linking the subject and predicate.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "penso" does not agree with its subject "Io". In Italian, the conjugation of the verb should match the number and person of the subject. In this case, it should be "penso" for first-person singular instead of "penso" which would imply second-person informal. Additionally, there seems to be an extraneous pronoun "di te", as the indirect object "ti" or "te" is already implied by the reflexive nature of the verb "pensare." A corrected version could be "Penso che ti piaccia il tartufo," implying that you think someone else likes truffles.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Emma" matches with the verb "ottiene", and the object "qualcosa" correctly follows the verb. Also, there is an appropriate preposition "da" used to indicate where Emma gets something from.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "Alice works to hunt Maria" does not make sense syntactically. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Alice works at hunting maria," but even then the semantic meaning of the sentence may still be strange depending on context as it implies that Alice has a job related to hunting Maria specifically. It might be better to say something like "Alice hunts with Maria."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the verb "plaudes" and the phrase "al fact that Tommaso has won" is correctly constructed as an adverbial clause of reason indicating why Riccardo is applauding.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it requires "meets" instead of "aspiras". In English, the verb should agree with the subject in number and person. Here, "Maria" is a singular third-person female subject, so we need to use the corresponding form of the verb, which is "meets."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "ci si aggrappa". Also, the reflexive pronoun "si" refers back to the subject of the sentence and shows that the action is being done by Maria upon herself.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" matches with the verb "mira," and the idea expressed is semantically coherent as well.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Giulia" agrees with the verb "guardava" and the tense of the verb is also appropriate for past actions. Additionally, there is an object "il muro" that correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and "lo thinks" is the verb phrase with "lo", a direct object pronoun referring to someone or something previously mentioned ("Tommaso").
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it requires "le" instead of "la" before "leghen." In Italian, when the subject of the sentence and the object are both singular feminine, we use "la" for the article only if the object comes immediately after the verb; otherwise, we need to add an agreement marker ("le") between the article and the infinitive verb form. So, a grammatically correct version would be: "Paola acconsente a che le legino."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it implies that Alice is happy about having cried, which may not be the intended meaning. A more neutral or positive alternative could be "Alice smiled after crying" or "Despite crying, Alice managed to smile".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. It means that the condition of distress arises from the lack of water.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject "We", a verb "decide" and an object "our analysis." The word "this" refers to something that was mentioned before in the conversation or text.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the dependent verb "dipende" agrees with its subject "la tosse," and the subordinate clause correctly explains the cause of the coughing.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "chiarire" requires an indirect object to indicate who or what is being clarified. In this case, it seems like "che non è colpa sua" is intended to be that indirect object, but it needs to be properly linked with the verb using a preposition such as "a". A possible correction would be: "Leonardo chiarisce che non è colpa sua a Paola."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the coordinating conjunction "and" should be used instead of "a" to connect two independent clauses "Andrea fischia" and "Maria che ha fame." So the corrected sentence would be: "Andrea fischia e Maria che ha fame."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The verb "accennerà" agrees with the singular subject "Andrea," and the conditional clause "se partirà" uses the correct form of the third person singular conjugation for the verb "partire." Overall, the structure of the sentence conveys its intended meaning clearly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English clause and all words are used appropriately according to their meaning and function within the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "aggiunge", and the preposition "nel" correctly introduces the location where the action takes place. Additionally, the pronoun "suo" refers to "Riccardo," which is clear from context even if not explicitly stated in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "ce" is an old-fashioned or dialectal way of saying "it." So the sentence means "Maria bet on it."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the word "journalists" is misspelled and should be "journalist" since it is singular. Additionally, there needs to be an agreement between the subject "the journalist" and the verb "attack", so "attacks" should be used instead of "attack".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola encourages the fact that the boys go to the sea" is a correct way of expressing this idea in English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper forms of the words for third person singular subjects. In this case "Emma" is the subject who is performing the action on the object "Alessandro", with "ne" being an adverb indicating manner or means.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear subject ("Gabriele"), verb ("convinces") and object ("lo", referring to "sciopero"). The word "che" introduces a subordinate clause modifying the noun phrase "lo sciopero".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "Riccardo" is both the subject and the object of the verb "eximes". It is possible because reflexive verbs like "esimere" can take the same entity as both their subject and object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the mayor," which is singular and agrees with the verb "exempts." Additionally, the object of the preposition "from" is "paying the bus," where "paying" functions as a gerund acting as an adjective modifying "bus."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" agrees with "si" and the clause "affinché il programma sia realizzato" is dependent on "si accorda", so there are no subject-verb agreement errors or other syntax issues. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear and coherent, indicating that there are no semantic problems.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires the verb "discusses" instead of "discorre". Since both subjects "Alice" and "Giulia" are singular, we need to use a singular form of the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are used appropriately and follow proper syntax rules. In this case, "Maria" is the subject, "si accorge" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject, and the clause "di essere innamorata dal fatto di arrossire" provides additional information about what Maria notices.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject and the verb "continua" agrees with it in number and person. The pronoun "lo" refers to a masculine singular direct object, which is implied but not explicitly stated in this sentence. A possible complete version of this sentence could be "Edoardo continua a mangiare quella pizza", where "quella pizza" would be the direct object.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "induglia" does not agree with its subject "Leonardo". In this context, the verb should be in third person singular form ("indulges") instead of third person plural form ("indulge"). Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Leonardo lo indúglia a comer."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the singular third person present tense verb "osa." Additionally, the infinitive phrase "mangiare" correctly follows the verb "osa," which means "dares to eat" in English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "è", and the tense and mood are appropriate for the meaning conveyed by the sentence. Additionally, there is no semantic inconsistency or ambiguity that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "ha", and there are no other errors found in morphology or semantics.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "Tommaso is eating the meal" instead of "Tommaso suoles the pasto". In English, we use "suoles" to mean something like "is used to", but this is not grammatically correct in this context. Additionally, "pasto" should be replaced with "meal."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "deve mangiarlo". Additionally, the pronoun "it" correctly refers to something previously mentioned and agrees with its antecedent in gender and number.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires a form of the verb "to be" between the subject "Gabriele" and the infinitive verb phrase "mangiarlo". It should be "Gabriele uses to eat it" or more commonly "Gabriele eats it."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "va", and the adverbial phrase "in camera" correctly modifies the meaning of the verb to indicate where the action takes place.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming simple sentences with a subject and a predicate. In this case, "Paola" is the subject and "sgambetta verso il ponte" is the predicate describing what the subject is doing. Additionally, all of the words are used correctly according to their part of speech, and there are no morphological or semantic errors present.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the subject "la folla" (the crowd) is plural and requires a verb conjugated for third person plural. In this case, it should be "corrono" instead of "lo corre".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and the verb "invia" agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso". Additionally, there are no apparent semantic errors or morphological issues.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "l'amica" and the verb "angoscia" agree in number and tense. Also, all other elements of the sentence are used correctly according to their function.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there should be "they" instead of "molte". A suitable correction would be: "They read the newspaper."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because there is no s at the end of "architect" to agree in number with the subject "some museums." It should be "architects" instead.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "mangia" and the object "la pizza" provides necessary information about what or who is being affected by the action of the verb.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires the past participle form of the verb "design" which is "designed". Therefore, the sentence should be: "That architect has designed some museums."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because there should be a comma after "molte ragazze" to separate the subject and the adverbial phrase of time. Additionally, it would be more grammatically correct to say "hanno letto il giornale, molte ragazze, lo scorso anno." This separates the subjects from the time expression with commas and changes the word order slightly for better clarity and flow.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "le spalle" agrees with the verb "toccano", and both are plural. Additionally, the preposition "di" correctly introduces the possessive noun "Riccardo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "will be touched," and the tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, the preposition "by" is correctly used before the phrase "that film."

0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "obbedisce" does not agree with its subject "Tommaso". In addition, there is no preposition to introduce the second subject "Maria", and it should be "a Maria" instead of just "Maria". A corrected version would be "Tommaso le obbedisce a Maria."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically incorrect but it contains a semantic error. The name "Andrea" has been repeated twice and the second instance should be replaced with "him". A correct version of this sentence would be: "Andrea compares Leonardo to him." This resolves any ambiguity about who is being compared to whom.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" and the verb "fotografa" agree in number (singular) and tense (present).

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate tense for the action described.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically incorrect but may be offensive or inappropriate to some people because it uses the phrase "cutting heads off," which often has a violent connotation. A more acceptable way to express this idea might be "Sofia castrated the bulls" or "Sofia removed the horns from the bulls."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the boys" agrees with the verb "would cut," and the word order follows standard English syntax rules for forming a declarative sentence expressing hypothetical action in the past tense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word usage. "Toro" is correctly used instead of "bufalo" since that is what Maria took by the horns. All words are morphologically and syntactically correct in their form and function within the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the singular verb form "stende," and the object of the sentence "il bucato" correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "my friend" agrees with the verb "abbaia" in number and person. Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules for simple sentences.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because "Riccardo" is the subject and "ulula" is an intransitive verb that agrees with it in number and person.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple past tense verb agreement with its subject "Gabriele." In English, a single subject requires a singular verb, and this requirement is met here.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il cane" agrees with the singular verb form "si è fermato". Additionally, the idiomatic expression "in un battibaleno" or "in un batter d'occhio", meaning "very quickly" or "in an instant," has been correctly used.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "Edoardo" matches with the verb "ci ha messo", and the time expression "due ore" correctly modifies the action described by the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "has sezioned." Additionally, the object of the sentence "the old elm tree" follows standard English rules for article usage and word order.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Le sei bombe"), a verb ("sono esplose") and an object ("il 6 maggio 1999"). The tense of the verb indicates that the action happened in the past, which is appropriate given the date mentioned. There are no morphological or syntactical errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense verb "has" matches with its singular subject "Lorenzo". Additionally, it uses the proper form of negation by placing "no" before the auxiliary verb "have", which also agrees with its subject in number and person.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "diventato" agrees with the singular subject "Andrea." Additionally, the adverbial phrase "in gamba," which means skillful or adept in Italian, correctly modifies the verb "diventato."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate tense to indicate that Tommaso performed an action in the past. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to Giulia" correctly shows who received the well wishes from Tommaso.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("Sofia"), an auxiliary verb ("does"), a main verb ("asks") and an object ("tu"). The word "torni" agrees with the subject "tu". Also, there are no spelling or punctuation errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "tu" requires the use of the second person singular form of the verb, which is "vai", instead of the third person singular form "va". Therefore, the correct version would be "Che tu te ne vada dispiace a Beatrice."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "I bambini" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "hanno." This indicates that there are more than one child involved. * "hanno calpestato" follows the rule for agreement between subjects and verbs. In Italian, when the subject is plural, the verb must also be in its plural form. * "le aiuole" is the direct object of the sentence. It correctly uses the definite article "le," which is used before feminine singular nouns starting with a vowel or s+consonant sound.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it makes no sense for children to burp out lava as this action and substance are not associated with humans. It would be more appropriate to say "The volcano erupted lava."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming a simple sentence with two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "and". Both clauses have subjects and verbs, and there are no missing or extra words that could make the sentence incorrect. Additionally, the use of tense is consistent throughout the sentence, as both clauses use the past tense to indicate an event that took place in the past ("has photographed" and "is avvenuto").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "that man" agrees with the singular verb form "has." Additionally, the object of the sentence, "ne," which refers to something mentioned before or implied, is also grammatically acceptable in this context.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the preposition "a" should be replaced with "and", as "Andrea cared for Beatrice's face," or "Andrea stroked Beatrice's face." The original form implies that something was done to Beatrice's face ("volto a"), which does not convey the intended meaning of touching affectionately between two people.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il volto di Paola" agrees with the singular verb "è carezzato". Additionally, the past participle "carezzato" correctly agrees with the masculine gender of the noun "volto."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all of the words are used appropriately. There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it has an incorrect interpretation of the event described. Paralyzing someone else is generally considered to be an involuntary and harmful act that would likely result from an accident or deliberate violence rather than something done casually by one person to another. A more appropriate way to express this idea might be "Leonardo accidentally caused Maria to injure her arm."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the child" agrees with the singular verb "weighed," and the phrase "nine kilos" is an acceptable unit of measurement for weight. Additionally, "a few months" functions as an adverbial adjunct indicating time frame.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "gli operai" (the workers) agrees with the verb "asfaltarono" (they paved). The action of paving the road was completed in the past and refers to multiple people performing this task together.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" matches with the verb "elencò", which agrees in number and tense. Additionally, the direct object "l'invitato" correctly follows the verb.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "ha messe" does not agree with its subject "Alice". It should be "Alice has put" instead of "ha messe". Additionally, there are two incorrect words in this sentence - "e" and "ciò", which shouldn't be present here.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in morphology, syntax, or semantics. "Maria" is the subject of the first clause and "ciò" refers back to "the clothes that Maria took off" as the subject of the second clause. Both subjects have singular verb agreement with "ha tolto" and "è accaduto," respectively.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Beatrice" is the subject that performs the action of filling, and "il frigo con frutta" is the object being filled with fruit.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects and verbs agree with each other in number, and the sentence structure follows standard English syntax rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "passes" agrees with the subject "the book," and "from Maria to Maria" correctly specifies the indirect object of the action described by the verb "pass."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for expressing an action performed by one subject onto another with a direct object. In this case, "Maria" gives "a book" to "Paola".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is the subject and "delegates" is the verb that agrees with it in number. "Gabriele" is the indirect object of the sentence, and "suo representante" is a noun phrase that describes who or what kind of representative Gabriele is for Francesco.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" has a verb "delegates" that agrees with it and an object "Maria" who receives the action of the verb. Also, there is a prepositional phrase "as her representative" which modifies the direct object.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires a conjugated verb to link "Lorenzo" and the event of "it happening." A possible correction could be: "Lorenzo lives there and this happens in Rome," or "Lorenzo lives there where this happens in Rome."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for simple sentences with two coordinated clauses. "Riccardo" is the subject of the first clause and "ciò" refers to an event or action that happened previously, making both subjects agree with their respective verbs "ha mangiato" and "è successo". Additionally, each clause has its own verb and there are no missing words, so the syntax is also correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" matches with the verb "fuma", and the object "una bionda" correctly follows the verb phrase. Additionally, the article "una" agrees in number with its noun "bionda".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb tense and agreement.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" matches with the verb "ha spalmato", and the object of the verb ("il pane di paté") follows correctly after it. Additionally, the article "il" agrees with its following noun "pane". There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "piovevano" does not agree with its subject "le bombe." In English, this would be like saying "the bombs rained on us," which is incorrect since "bombs" is plural and requires a plural form of the verb, such as "dropped" or "fell." A corrected version could be "Le bombe ci cadevano addosso" or "Le bombe ci caddero addosso," both of which use verbs that correctly correspond to the plural noun "bombe."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "Matrimoni" is the plural form of marriage, which agrees with the plural subject "mixed marriages". Additionally, the verb "work" correctly matches the plural subject in number. The adverb "perfectly" modifies the verb appropriately. Therefore, there are no semantic or syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "La tua idea equivale alla mia" has a subject ("la tua idea") and a predicate ("equivale alla mia"). Both the subject and predicate agree in number (singular) and person (third). Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Both "idea" and "la" are singular and agree with their respective verbs. Additionally, the subject of the second clause ("la") matches the verb tense and number of the first clause.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "gira", and the action described by the verb makes sense in the given context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Giulia" agrees with the verb "torna", and the preposition "da" correctly indicates change of location from Milan to Naples.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" performs an action ("controlla") on the object "Paola". Both the number of subjects and verbs match, making it syntactically sound.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object and uses proper verb tense agreement between "Maria" and "acconsente". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "to that boy" correctly modifies the verb "go out."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb to connect the two subjects "Alice" and "Maria". A correct version could be "Alice watches Maria", or if they are both watching something together, then you can say "Alice and Maria watch."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "Paola" is the subject, "dubits" is the verb in third person singular form that agrees with the subject, and there is an indirect object "of you". Therefore, no errors are found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject and "desires" is the verb. "That you leave" is a subordinate clause acting as the direct object of the main clause. It consists of the conjunction "that", the subject pronoun "you" and the verb "leave". All elements are used correctly for number, person and tense agreement.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a subjunctive mood clause in English. "That Juliet be" or "Juliet be" would both also be acceptable here, with no change to the meaning. This construction implies that Juliet being (or traveling) always is something that Andre likes, and this idea exists only in his mind; thus, we use the subjunctive mood.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects and verbs agree with each other in number and tense. "Emma" is singular and so is "voluntarily", while "affascinates" agrees with "Emma". Similarly, "Francesco" is also singular and matches with "affascinates".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the structure of a complex sentence with a subjunctive mood verb "venga" after the conjunction "che". In this case, "Francesco" is the subject who wants something to happen in the future and uses the appropriate form for that purpose.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" and the verb "annota" agree in number and tense, as well as the relative clause "that the president will write his autobiography." It also includes necessary prepositions such as "on" and proper use of articles like "the".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the subjunctive mood needs to be used after "invitare" when talking about suggestions or requests. Also, there should be an infinitive verb after "che". A possible correction would be: "Alessandro invita Paola a partire."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with the subject "Alice" and the verb "has accompanied". The indirect object of the sentence is "Tommaso", and the destination or goal of the action is expressed by the prepositional phrase "al cinema." All elements are used correctly according to their function.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la partenza" agrees with the verb "apporta", and the sentence has a clear meaning that leaving can be beneficial to everyone involved.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. It means that "Alessandro is complaining about the dirty sea to Paola."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error present. "Andrea" is the subject and "leaves" is the verb while "to Leoanrdo" acts as an indirect object and "pieni poteri" serves as the direct object of the sentence.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not morphologically correct because "piatto" should be in its plural form ("piatti") to agree with the verb "piange", which is singular present tense and requires a plural subject.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "girare" should agree with the subject "le scatole", which is plural. Therefore, it should be "mi giro" instead of "mi girano".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alice" agrees with the verb "si è attaccata", and the object "un capello" follows the rules of Italian syntax. Additionally, there are no semantic issues as all words have appropriate meanings that make sense together.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "piantato" does not agree with its subject "Maria". A singular third-person feminine subject requires the corresponding form of the past participle ("ha piantato" should be "ha plantato").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia and Riccardo" is plural and agrees with the verb "parlano." Additionally, the preposition "la" correctly precedes its object "stessa lingua," which refers to the language that both Sofia and Riccardo speak. Overall, the sentence has no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "have" should be in its third person singular form "has". In this case, the subject of the sentence "courage" is treated as grammatically singular and requires a corresponding verb conjugation.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the word "paturnies" does not exist in English language. It seems that it could be an incorrect form of the word "qualms", which should have been used in its plural form as "have qualms". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Have qualms."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the possessive form should be used with "boxes" to indicate possession, which would result in "on their boxes." The verb "have" requires a base form of the following verb, so no change is needed for this part of the sentence.
0	Morphology	The phrase is not correct because the verb "being" should be used instead of "esse" to agree with the subject "one". Additionally, there is no need for an article before "womb." A corrected version would be: "Being in a womb of a cow."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and "spera" is the verb. The subjunctive mood is used correctly to express hope or desire about a hypothetical situation ("possa partire").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Beatrice," verb "has" and an object of the preposition "attention." There are no morphological or syntactical errors that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alice" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb form "is". Additionally, the state of being anxious is appropriately conveyed through the use of the adjective "anxious."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Siamo" is the first person plural form of the verb "essere," and it agrees with its subject "noi." The phrase "cariche di viveri" means "stocked with supplies" or "loaded with provisions," which correctly describes something that the speaker possesses. Therefore, this sentence does not contain any morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the girl" agrees with the verb "will eat" and the object "the pizza". Also, there are no obvious morphological or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "she" matches with the verb "has presented", and the object "the woman" along with its prepositional phrase "to his friends" are also used correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" has an appropriate verb tense and agreement with the verb "obeys." Additionally, the object of the sentence "Sofia" follows proper case assignment as it serves as the recipient of the action taken by the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "ci va" agrees with it in number and person.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the singular verb form "andrà". Additionally, there are no obvious morphological or semantic errors present that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for each of the subjects. Here "Edoardo" is the subject who is doing an action which is to go ("va") and "Giulia" is also another subject but with different actions that are implied through context or shared knowledge between speakers.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "Beatrice" does not match with the verb form "scappa". It should be "Beatrice scappa" instead of "Beatrice le scappa", as "le" is unnecessary and changes the meaning of the sentence to something unintended.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "i libri" agrees with the verb "mette", and the adverb "ora" correctly modifies the verb tense to present progressive. Additionally, the article "gli" appropriately refers back to the masculine noun "scaffali".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the verb "mette", and there is a clear object "libri". Additionally, the preposition "sugli" has been correctly used with its article "gli" to indicate where the action of putting takes place.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the word order is incorrect. It should be "Sono gli libri quelli che Leonardo mette sugli scaffali ora" or "È quel che Leonardo mette sui scaffali adesso". In this case, it appears that there may have been an attempt to use the cleft sentence structure but with some errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea mangia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian sentences. In this case, the singular third person present tense verb form "mangia" agrees with its singular subject "Andrea".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of subject-verb-object and uses proper verb tense agreement between the subject "Leonardo" and the verb "does." Additionally, the use of the possessive form "his" correctly modifies the noun "work," indicating that he is the one performing the action on his own work.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo and I will go to the park" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with the number of its subject. In this case, the subject "Riccardo and I" is two people, so the verb "will go" is used instead of "goes." Additionally, the word order is appropriate for an English declarative sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Francesco"), a verb ("piace") and an object ("Maria"). Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase "per le sue gambe" that functions as an adverbial modifier explaining why Francesco likes Maria.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" and the verb "accarezza" agree in number (singular) and the object of the preposition "di" has the correct form ("le gambe") to match with the feminine singular noun "Maria".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "gradì". Also, the direct object "quell'allusione" agrees with the gender and number of the article "quella", which refers to it.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is the subject and "ricorda qualcosa" is the predicate of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics. "Era" agrees with the subject and refers to the past conversation that both boys had.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and the verb "has betrayed" agrees with its singular subject "He".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Era" agrees with the singular subject "he or she," and "felice" correctly describes his or her emotional state. Additionally, "di" is used appropriately as a preposition to indicate that he or she was happy about something specific, even though it isn't explicitly mentioned in this case.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "he" agrees with the verb "was," and the past tense of the verb indicates that he was happy at some point in the past while playing cards.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object pattern and all words are used appropriately based on their part of speech. "Alessandro" is the subject, "disgusta" is the verb, and "Giulia" is the object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "People" is a plural noun and requires the verb to be in its plural form as well. In this case, "enjoy" is used instead of "enjoys".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It implies that someone or something bit the bait on a fishing hook, and it uses the past tense "ha abboccato" to indicate this action happened in the past.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the past tense of "to laugh" should be "laughed". Instead, "risi" was used which is the first person singular conjugation for the past tense of "ridere" in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense for third person singular "ha preso," which agrees with its singular subject "Ha" (He).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "is". Additionally, there are no other apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and uses proper verb tense to convey past actions performed by the subject "he".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all words are used appropriately according to their context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and the verb "has compared" agrees with its singular subject "Paola". Additionally, all of the words are used appropriately for their intended meaning, making the overall sentence semantically correct as well.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "ha immerso" and the object "il figlio" follows the right order after the verb. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "nell'acqua fredda" provides more context to where or how something happened. Overall, there are no syntactic, morphological, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "leggeva" in number and tense. Additionally, the preposition "sul" correctly introduces the location where the action of reading was taking place.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the word "consensus" means agreement or accord while "the birth of something from someone" implies creation rather than agreement. A more appropriate way to phrase this could be "The people admire his talent so much that it led to a general consensus."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is the subject and the verb "guarda" agrees with it in number and person. The phrase "che tutto proceda per il meglately" is a dependent clause that functions as the direct object of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in English. "Francesco" is the subject and "si vergogna" is the verb phrase indicating that he feels shame or embarrassment about something that happened (the object of his embarrassment is implied).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Giulia" agrees with the verb "deve", and the adverbial modifier "domani" correctly describes when the action will take place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" established the departure of "Tommaso with Maria". This means that Francesco arranged or decided on the departure of both Tommaso and Maria together.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "has left", and the object of the sentence "the husband" follows the appropriate possessive form "Maria's".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "l'affitto" agrees with the verb "rende", and the object "quella casa" correctly follows the preposition "di". Additionally, the amount of money is expressed using the masculine singular form "500 euros," which also agrees with the gender and number of the noun it modifies.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the proper form of the past tense of the verb "to put" and forms a yes-no question with appropriate word order and punctuation.
0	Morphology	The verb "monta" should be "monte" to agree with the singular subject "il sangue". So the grammatically correct form of this sentence would be: "Gli monte il sangue alla testa molto facilmente."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules and has appropriate verb tense for the subject "he".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because "that land fruits much money" is semantically incorrect. Land cannot produce money; it can only generate crops or other natural resources that have monetary value when harvested and sold. A more accurate way to phrase this idea would be something like "That land generates substantial revenue," assuming the intent was to communicate that the income from selling the products of the land is high.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "ha fatto", and the indirect object "Lorenzo" has a clear agent "Riccardo". Additionally, the sentence structure follows standard Italian syntax rules for this type of construction.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "il vento". It should be "Il vento **ha** fatto rompere il vetro da Andrea."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "made" does not agree with its subject "the colonel." In English, past tense verbs typically end in "-ed," but they also need to match the number and person of their subjects. In this case, since "colonel" is singular, the verb should be "made," not "have made." A grammatically correct version would be: "The colonel made the ship."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "si è fatto" is correctly used to indicate that Lorenzo had something done to him rather than doing it himself. Additionally, the singular noun "vetrata" agrees with the singular subject "la." Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the rock" and the verb "has broken" agree in number (singular) and tense (simple past). Additionally, the object of the sentence, "the window," correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "the auto" is singular and the verb "has" agrees with it in number. Additionally, "ha schiacciato l'acceleratore" is also grammatically correct as an Italian phrase.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it contains an incorrect use of the word "colpo." A more appropriate word would be needed to convey that someone pushed down on the accelerator pedal with their foot. For example: "He pressed down hard on the accelerator" or "She gave the gas pedal a swift kick".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and uses proper tense agreement between the subject "Lorenzo" and the verb "has broken".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of English sentences and uses words with appropriate forms and functions. "Il" refers to something mentioned before or known from context, which can be referred to as a definite direct object in this case. "caldo" means hot as an adjective, agreeing with its noun "il", referring to weather conditions; "ha" is the third-person singular form of the verb "to have," used here implying causality between the subject and the action towards the direct object, and "avariato" is the past participle of the verb "avarire" meaning spoiled or ruined.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the humidity" matches with the singular verb "has." Additionally, the direct object "the iron" correctly follows after the transitive verb "oxidized."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense agreement between the subject "Gabriele" and the verb "has made." Additionally, the object of the sentence, "the iron," has been correctly transformed into its past participle form, "ossidated," to indicate that some action was done on it by the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and uses the past tense form "fu" to indicate that the action occurred at a specific point in time in the past. Additionally, the phrase "dell'esplosione di un colpo" provides additional information about what caused the glass to break, making the sentence clearer and more informative. Overall, the sentence conveys a complete thought and does not contain any grammar or syntax errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and the reflexive pronoun "si" refers back to it correctly as an indirect object, agreeing with it in gender and number. Additionally, the verb "è lavata" agrees with the subject in number and tense.

0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because "impelagare" does not exist in the Italian language and it seems like an incorrect form of the verb "impolverare", which means to make something dusty or dirty with dust. A more appropriate word choice would be "perso" (lost) if referring to hair, resulting in the corrected sentence being: "Il gatto ha perso dei peli sul divano."

Additionally, the prepositional phrase "for all morning" modifies the duration of the action accurately.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of an independent clause with the subject "Gabriele" and the verb "has proseguited." The time expression "per ore" indicates for how long the action has lasted.

Finally, we have the phrase "of 10%" indicating the degree to which the increase occurred. Overall, the structure and form are proper for standard English usage.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of the verb "to render" agrees with the subject and it has been conjugated correctly as "have rendered."

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "si è fatta" agrees with the singular and feminine noun "l'aria", which means "the air". Additionally, the past participle "puzzolente" correctly describes the air as smelling bad.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb. "The situation" is the subject of the sentence but there is no verb to indicate what the situation does or what happens with it. A corrected version could be: "The situation becomes incredibly complicated."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb. It should be "A Riccardo, these topics have not convinced him." Instead of just "A Riccardo, these topics not convinced him.", which has no main verb to form a complete thought.

0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "calm" should be in past tense to agree with the past tense of the verb "ha fatto". Additionally, the indirect object pronoun "lo" or "gli" should be used before "quell'uomo". A corrected version could be: "Alice lo fece calmare a Andrea da quell'uomo."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "Maria". It should be "Maria ha fatto preoccupare Gabriele con la sua fidanzata." In this corrected version, "ha fatto" agrees with "Maria", and "con la sua fidanzata" indicates that it was her girlfriend who caused the worry for Gabriele.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the verb "irretire" does not make sense in this context. It would be more appropriate to use a verb that indicates an action or event that connects Maria and Leonardo together. For example, "Maria introduced herself to Leonardo."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "si seduce" should be "seduces" since the subject "Riccardo" is singular and requires a third person singular verb form in English.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "piacere" should be used with the indirect object pronoun and an infinitive verb to indicate that Lorenzo liked something. A possible correction could be: "Lorenzo ha gradito ciò."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for simple sentences in English.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "ha," and the prepositional phrase "of ciò" correctly follows the noun it modifies, namely "timore."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "This frightens Mary" instead of "Ciò fa terrore a Maria". In English, the word "this" needs to agree with the subject "it", and in Italian, "ciò" needs to agree with the verb "fa". Additionally, the Italian translation for "fear" is "paura", while "terrore" means "terror."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense verb "feels" agrees with its singular subject "Emma". Additionally, the word order and syntax are also correct.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the reflexive pronoun "si" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is singular and agrees with the past participle "scottata".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the reflexive pronoun "si" requires a corresponding reflexive verb to agree with it in number and gender. In this case, the verb should be "è rotto-*SI*" instead of just "è rotta". Also, there needs to be an article before "Maria", such as "la" or "una". So the corrected form could be "Gabriele si è rotto della sua macchina di Maria."

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with its singular subject "la palla".

0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the imperative form of the verb should be used instead of the third person present tense. In English, commands or requests typically use the base form of the verb without any subject-verb agreement. Therefore, "mi raccomando" should be changed to "ricordati."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the child" agrees with the verb "cries." In English, verbs typically change form to agree with their subjects in number; however, for third person singular present tense verbs like "cries," an -s or -es is added to the base form of the verb. This rule holds true even when there are words between the subject and its corresponding verb, as long as those intervening words do not function as the subject themselves.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" matches with the verb "perde", and there are no other errors in morphology, syntax or semantics.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb forms for the subjects. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence, which is singular; therefore, the third person singular form of the verb "to have," which is "has," is used correctly with "Maria." Additionally, the phrase "improvvisamente" modifies the action "ha rubato" appropriately to indicate that she stole his heart suddenly. Overall, this sentence does not contain any morphological, syntactic, or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple present tense sentence with a subject ("Emma") and a verb ("was having"). Additionally, "se la passava" can be considered colloquial or dialectal for "she was having a good time."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. Juliet is the subject of the sentence, and "put" is the verb that agrees with the third person singular subject. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "addosso to Lorenzo" correctly describes where Juliet placed her eyes.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "abbandonò", and the object of the preposition "sul" has the definite article "il," which refers to "abito." Additionally, there are no obvious morphological or semantic errors present.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "Gabriele" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "prese." - "Prese" is the simple past tense form of the verb "prendere," which means "to take" in English. It agrees with its singular subject "Gabriele." - "L'auto" is the direct object of the sentence, introduced by the definite article "l'" to indicate that this specific car was taken.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because "trombosis" is a medical condition and cannot be taken by someone. It should be replaced with an object that can be possessed or used by the subject Alexandra. For example, "Alessandro took the trumpet."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La trombosi" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the singular verb "venne". Additionally, the past tense was used correctly to indicate that the event occurred in the past.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of "venire" ("to come") agrees with the subject "il tifo," which is singular.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of "avere" ("ebbe") agrees with the singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the verb "ebbe" correctly follows the subject "Riccardo", and there are no other errors in morphology, syntax or semantics.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because "cheese" is singular and cannot take the past tense verb "made". Instead, one should use a linking verb such as "became", or rephrase the sentence to indicate that some cheese(s) developed mold.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English independent clause with a subject ("Sofia") and a verb ("ebbé"). Additionally, "un" agrees in number with "bagno."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Beatrice") and a verb ("maritò"), and expresses a complete thought.

Here, "Alessandro" is the subject and "si bagnò" is the verb phrase, which agrees with the singular subject in number and person. Additionally, this sentence has a clear meaning that Alex took a bath or got wet intentionally or accidentally.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" matches with the verb "arieg giò", and there are no other errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics that would make it incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because "nave" is a singular third-person feminine noun that requires the past tense verb form "ammarò" to agree with it in gender and number.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "prese", and the object of the verb ("la terra") correctly follows it. Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors that would make this sentence incorrect.

0	Morphology	The phrase is not correct because the past tense of "take" should be used instead of the base form for consistency with the past tense verb "prese." Therefore, it should be "Andrea took his hat."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "prese" does not agree with its subject "Paola". In this case, "prese" which means "took" in past tense should be replaced by "preseva" to match feminine singular form of the verb for the subject "Paola".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "prese", and the past tense form of the verb indicates that the action was completed in the past. Additionally, there are no semantic or morphological errors present in this sentence.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence and the verb "si innamorò" agrees with the singular subject "Edoardo".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because "un odio" cannot be used to express dislike or hatred towards someone. Instead, we should use the verb "odiare", so the correct form of the sentence would be "Paola odiò Tommaso".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because birds typically do not feed from their mother. Instead, baby birds receive food (are "imbeccati") from the parent bird(s). Therefore, the corrected sentence should be "The mother bird fed the babies" or similar wording that reflects accurate biological behavior of birds and their young.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb form "prese", and both are in past tense. Also, the object of the sentence "una cotta" agrees with the verb. Furthermore, there is no semantic inconsistency or ambiguity that could make it incorrect.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Francesco" agrees with the verb "prese", and the possessive pronoun "his" correctly modifies the noun "lama".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and uses proper word order in English. "Leonardo" is the subject and "fece" is the verb that agrees with the singular third person form of the past tense. Additionally, there are no semantic errors or morphological issues present.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Fecero" agrees with the subject "Maria," and "seduta" is the direct object of the verb "fecero." Additionally, "di elioterapia" describes what kind of session it was, so it functions as an adjective phrase modifying "seduta." Overall, the structure and word choice are appropriate for standard English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "prese," and the tense of the verb indicates that the action happened in the past. Additionally, the article "il" correctly precedes "treno."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there should be an apostrophe after "redazione" to indicate possession. The corrected version would be: "È stato perso troppo spesso il treno nella loro redazione." or "Il treno è stato perso troppe volte qui, nella nostra redazione."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for an English simple sentence.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the third person singular verb form "is", and the predicate noun "chimico" correctly follows the linking verb "is".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "Tommaso esercitò il suo giudizio" instead of "Tommaso mise giudizio". In the original phrase, there is no direct object to indicate what was put, making the verb "mise" grammatically incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in morphology, syntax or semantics. "Lorenzo" is the subject of the sentence and he is the one who said something to Maria. The phrase "ne" refers to "two", which means that Lorenzo mentioned two things to Maria. This usage of "ne" is acceptable in informal Italian conversations.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence and uses words appropriately to convey a complete thought. "Beatrice" is the subject who performed an action denoted by the verb "prese", which means took or accepted something unwisely. "Fischi per fiaschi" is an idiomatic expression that literally translates to "whistles for flasks," but figuratively refers to taking or accepting things without understanding their true value or meaning. Overall, the sentence conveys a clear idea and does not contain any morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" matches with the singular verb form "butta", and the object "olio" agrees in number with the verb. Additionally, the preposition "on" is correctly used to indicate that oil is being thrown onto the fire.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "fa", and the action described by the verb is clearly expressed. Additionally, there is no ambiguity or confusion regarding the meaning of the sentence. Overall, it follows standard Italian syntax rules for forming simple sentences with a clear subject-verb agreement and an appropriate object ("le traduzioni").
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper subject-verb agreement. In this case, the verb "diride" does not agree with the implied subject ("people" or "they"). A grammatically correct version of this sentence could be "People laugh at you derisively."
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso legge." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense verb form "legge" agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso".

Both clauses are correctly conjugated according to their respective subjects and actions.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple yes-no question that asks whether Leo dislikes Paola.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "Alessandro" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "andò", past tense singular form of "go". There are no semantic errors either, as all words have their appropriate meanings that convey a logical idea.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. In the sentence "Alessandro turned, with his car, to pick her up," there are two coordinate phrases connected by the conjunction "with." These phrases describe how Alessandro turned and what he used to turn. Therefore, it is appropriate to use the comma before "to" because it signals that the following verb phrase ("to pick her up") is not part of the first clause or coordinate phrase but rather starts another one.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "The steamboat veered to save them" is a complete thought and follows the rules of English syntax. There are no morphological errors or semantic inconsistencies.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "obbedisce", and the pronoun "he" refers to a singular noun, which is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, there are no punctuation or word choice errors that would make it incorrect.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" matches with the singular verb form "ama", and the object of the sentence "bigné" also agrees in number. Additionally, the article "i" preceding "bignè" correctly indicates that it is plural.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the lemon" agrees with the verb "loves," and the object of the preposition "of" ("liberty") correctly follows it. Additionally, the article "the" preceding "lemon" indicates that this noun refers to a specific lemon, which is appropriate since lemons are not typically thought of as abstract entities. Overall, the syntax, morphology, and semantics of the sentence appear accurate and coherent.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because gardeners typically prune plants or trees, not dogs. A more appropriate word to use instead of "potato" could be "groomed."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the indirect object "Alessandro" should come before the direct object "una ricca eredità", so it should be "A Lorenzo, Alessandro le ha lasciato una ricca eredità."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" matches with the verb "beve", and there are no other errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all words have been used appropriately according to their meanings.

0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because "cotta" does not make sense in this context when referring to a refrigerator having feelings towards someone. A more appropriate word choice would be necessary to convey the intended meaning accurately.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "dette," and the direct object "gli schiaffi" has the required article "degli." Additionally, the indirect object "a Maria" correctly uses the preposition "a" before the name of the person receiving the action.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense and agreement for the given context. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject who performs an action on the object "Giulia," which is expressed through the transitive verb "allungò." In English, this would translate to "Riccardo slapped Giulia."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the verb form "resta", and there are no other errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the verb "has", and there are no other errors related to morphology or semantics that would make this sentence incorrect.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "the ink" matches the verb "is", and the object "charge of the fountain pen" follows the appropriate structure. There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that the fountain pen has been loaded and is ready to use.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" and the verb "fruga" agree in number (singular) and tense (present). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "nei cassetti della scrivania di Giulia" provides clear information about where Tommaso is searching.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "carries," both being singular. Additionally, the object of the sentence "the watch" follows proper prepositional phrase structure and the action described by the verb makes sense semantically.

It also lacks context for justifying such behavior, making it seem inappropriate and unnecessary.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo") and an action verb ("sale"). The phrase "per una seconda volta" is a temporal adverbial that indicates when the action takes place, while "le scale di corsa" is the direct object of the verb. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.

0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "corre" does not agree with its subject "Alessandro". In English, this would be like saying "Alessandro runs the donkey", but it should be "Alessandro runs WITH the donkey" or "Alessandro is running the donkey race". However, I am unsure if there is an equivalent phrase to "run a race" using an animal as the object in Italian. Therefore, I will suggest two possible corrections for your consideration. Correction option 1: Alessandro fa correre l'asina. This means that Alessandro makes the donkey run. Correction option 2: Alessandro corre con l'asina. This means that Alessandro runs with the donkey.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for the subjects involved in the action.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because refrigerators cannot entice or charm cats; this leads to a semantic inconsistency as the action performed by the subject does not align with what we know about its capabilities and nature.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because the verb "ha sedotto" does not make sense with the subject "il frigorifero" and the object "un tavolo". Seduction implies an intentional action to influence someone or something to gain their favor, which doesn't apply in this context. Additionally, inanimate objects like refrigerators cannot have agency to perform such actions.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of its parts are used appropriately to convey a clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la sala" agrees with the verb "applaudì" and the phrase "all'affermazione dell'oratore" provides clear context for who or what received the applause.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "ha letto", and the object "un libro" follows standard Italian syntax rules.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the word "biglietto" should be "biglietti" to match with the plural subject "Maria and Jane". In English it would be "Maria and Jane collect love letters." So you need to make the noun agree with the plural subject by making it "biglietti".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "ha tosato", and the direct object "lo zio" correctly follows the required masculine singular direct object pronoun "lo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "Paola" is the subject doing an action to the object "una corsa." In this case, there is no direct object but rather an indirect object introduced by the preposition "in," which is followed by the location "giardino." All words are used appropriately for their parts of speech and number.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that Riccardo and Maria are exchanging books with each other.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alice" matches with the singular verb "has curved."

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "si gonfia", and the object "la testa" follows proper word order after the reflexive pronoun "si". All elements of the sentence have clear meanings that contribute to its coherence, demonstrating semantic accuracy as well.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "piantato" does not agree with its subject "Beatrice". A better way to phrase it would be "Beatrice ha lasciato in bruttezza Julietta." or "Beatrice has abandoned Julia.", where the verb matches the number and gender of the subject.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically incorrect but it implies an impossible task. Understanding the secret intentions of another person goes beyond linguistic competence and enters into the realm of mind-reading or telepathy, both of which are currently outside the scope of human capability.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "cambia" and the object "le carte" is correctly declined to match the direct object pronoun "le". Additionally, there are no semantic errors as all words have appropriate meanings that fit together logically.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the adjective "cattivo" agrees with the noun "gioco", but it should agree with the subject of the sentence, which is "Riccardo". Therefore, the adjective should be changed to its singular masculine form, which is "cattivo". So, the corrected sentence would be: "Riccardo fa un cattivo gioco."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and the verb "ha rotti" agrees with its subject "Andrea", which is singular. Additionally, there is no semantic or morphological error present.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically incorrect, but the statement itself may not be true depending on the context and volume of the rock music being played. "Break" typically implies something negative or destructive happening to the object that it is applied to, so this could imply that the speaker finds loud rock music unpleasant. However, without more information about the situation, it is difficult to definitively say whether the use of "breaks" here is appropriate or not.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject of the sentence "Riccardo" has given an object "quel che è di Tommaso" to its indirect object "Tommaso".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules and has a clear subject ("la mosca"), verb ("salta") and object ("il naso di Riccardo"). Additionally, the word "al" correctly indicates movement towards something, which fits with the meaning of the sentence.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "go" should be in the imperative form which is "go", but instead it says "goes". Since there is no subject for this sentence, we assume that it is meant to be an order or request and use the base form of the verb accordingly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Being at the index" is a valid phrase and can be used to mean being a topic of discussion or focus.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a clear subject ("The cat"), verb ("sat"), and object ("the mat"). Additionally, the word "on" correctly indicates the spatial relationship between the cat and the mat.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "alza" should agree with its subject "il gomito," which is masculine singular. However, "alzare" is the incorrect form; it should be "alza." Therefore, this error falls under morphological agreement between the subject and the verb.
0	Lexicon-Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "perdere" requires a direct object to complete its meaning and give sense to the sentence. In this case, it could be something like "Perdere la pazienza."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "to rake" should agree with its direct object "someone" in number and person. Therefore, it should be "raking out someone" instead of "raking out somebody". Additionally, there should be an article before "qualcuno", so the corrected phrase would be "Cavar la castagna del fuoco a qualcuno."
0	Morphology	The phrase is not correct because the past participle of "to be" should agree with the subject "we". Therefore, it should say "We have been poor in spirit", instead of "Being poor in spirit."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "l'angelo custode" agrees with the verb "accompagna", and the object of the preposition "di" has an appropriate singular form "la fantasia". Also, the definite article "il" before "bambino" correctly indicates that we are talking about all children as a group rather than individual children.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "ogni bambino" agrees with the verb "ha", and the object "un angelo custode" correctly follows the definite article "un". Additionally, the relative clause "che lo protegge" provides more information about the guardian angel. Overall, the sentence is well-structured and has no syntactic or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "lo smoking" agrees with the singular verb "è." Additionally, the prepositional phrase "di rigore" functions as an adverbial of manner and modifies how one should dress for the party. Therefore, this sentence can be translated to English as "At that party, a tuxedo is required."
0	Morphology	The word "zecca" is incorrectly used here; it should be "tick-free" or something similar to indicate that the motorcycle has no problems. The word "nuota", which means "swims" in Italian, does not make sense in this context and seems like a typo.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject "I" agrees with the verb "have", and the object "an unit" follows the verb correctly. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase "in march" that describes how the unit was seen.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper verb tense to connect the subject "Leonardo" with the predicate "piace a Maria". A possible correction could be: "Che Leonardo torni, piace a Maria." or "Che Leonardo sia tornato, piace a Maria."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" matches with the singular verb form "corre", and the action described by the verb makes sense in this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" is clearly singular and the verb "sorride" agrees with it in number. Also, there is a direct object "Sofia", which correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Beatrice" matches with the verb "bada", and the meaning of the sentence is clear. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" and the verb "divorza" agree in number (singular) and tense (present). Additionally, the object of the sentence, "Paola," also agrees with the subject and verb in number. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "abita", and the prepositional phrase correctly modifies where the action of the verb takes place.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it contradicts what we know about the world. Maria is a common name for women and Rome is an Italian city. Therefore, the statement "Maria is not in Rome" is semantically incorrect. To make this sentence grammatically correct but still false, you could say something like "Maria isn't currently visiting Rome."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of English sentences and the verb "brillano" agrees with its subject "mille stelle".
1	Correct	The sentence "I can help you with that." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement between the subject ("I") and the verb ("can help"). There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "Tutti i giorni" means "every day," which modifies how often the action takes place. "Leonardo" is the subject who performs the action. "Intensely" describes the verb "studies." "Li" refers to "tre ore" or "three hours," which is the object that receives the action. Overall, the structure of the sentence makes sense with no errors found.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la parete" agrees with the singular verb "è touched." Additionally, the preposition "da" followed by the possessive form of the proper noun ("di Riccardo") correctly indicates that it is from Riccardo's shoulders that the wall is being touched.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" and the verb "tocca" agree in number (singular) and tense (present). Also, the object of the sentence, "la schiena di Paola," is correctly formed with the definite article "la" before the body part "schiena." Additionally, possession is indicated using "di" after the possessed noun "Paola." Overall, the sentence communicates that Lorenzo touches Paola's back, which makes sense semantically as well.
1	Correct	The sentence "The cat is on the mat" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. The subject "the cat" is singular, so the verb "is" agrees with it. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "on the mat" correctly modifies the location of "the cat." There are no apparent morphological, syntactic, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "mangia," and the adverb "poca" correctly modifies the noun "frutta."
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea beve." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian language where singular subjects require singular verbs and vice versa. In this case, "Andrea" is a singular noun and "beve," which means "drinks," is its corresponding singular verb form, making the sentence grammatically acceptable.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the adverb "sadistically" should be used instead of the adjective "sadism." Additionally, there needs to be an object for the verb "pinzare," such as "Francesco pizzica la farfalla con sadismo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" matches with the singular verb form "disegna". Additionally, the action described by the verb is possible and makes sense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" agrees with the verb "balla", and the object of the sentence "la rumba" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, there are no apparent errors in word choice or meaning, so it appears to be semantically correct as well.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word usage. "Siesta" is a singular noun that means a short sleep or nap taken during the day for rejuvenation purposes, and "è" is the appropriate third person singular form of the verb "to be." Therefore, there are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Francesco" agrees with the verb "nuota" and the preposition "a" followed by "rana" correctly indicates that Francesco is swimming using the breaststroke.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the sponge" agrees with the verb "cleans," and there are no apparent errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because it should be "the bitter tea" instead of "the amaro." In English, we say "bitter tea," not "amaro tea."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because "lavori" does not have a clear antecedent and the meaning of the sentence is ambiguous as a result. It is unclear whether "labori" refers to multiple jobs or an abstract concept of work that led to the widening of the square. A possible revision could be "The completed construction projects have made the plaza wider."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "afferra" and the object of the preposition "il" correctly precedes its noun phrase complement "gatto".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and "reflects" is the verb. Even though there are two objects in this sentence ("on" and "the cat"), they can be combined into one prepositional phrase acting as the single object of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming complex sentences with a main and dependent clause. Here, "Andrea" is the subject of the main clause, while "the validity of Maria's claims" serves as the object complement.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Gabriele", an auxiliary verb "has" and a past participle "seen". The direct object of the sentence is "una casa di mattoni rossi". The phrase follows the SVO pattern (Subject-Verb-Object) which is common for Italian sentences.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" has a singular verb form "ha", and the object of the sentence "casa" also agrees with it in number. Additionally, the word order follows standard English rules for declarative sentences.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I libri vecchi" agrees with the verb "stanno," and the adverbial phrase of place "nella cassa" correctly specifies where the old books are located.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for expressing an action performed by one entity on another and then transferred to a third entity using the proper prepositions "from" and "to". In this case, the book passes from Beatrice to Francesco.
0	Morphology	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, "there is" or "there are" should be used instead of "there's". Since "facts and words" is plural, the correct form would be "there are." Therefore, the corrected sentence should read: "There are sometimes inconsistencies between Maria's facts and her words."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "mette", and there are no obvious errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "Lorenzo" is the subject of the sentence and the verb that agrees with it is "stacca". Also, "la foto" is the direct object which completes the meaning of the verb "stacca". So overall, this sentence has appropriate morphological agreement between its words as well as syntactically correct structure.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject "Emma" is the one who performed the action of finding something which is indicated by the verb "has ritrovato". The object that was found is "l'anello", and its location before being found is specified as "nel cassetto."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the mechanism of a rotor lodges itself in that casing or housing.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "quella scatola" agrees with the verb "conserva" and the objects "le foto", "di Alessandro," and "di Edoardo" are all correctly declined and positioned within the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Questo" and a predicate "è avvenuto al bar". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Paola"), verb ("ha estratto") and two complements ("la pistola" and "ciò ha avuto luogo dalla borsa"). There are no morphological or syntactic errors that would make the sentence incorrect.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because books generally belong "in" and not "on" or "at" a folder. Additionally, the preposition "in" should be followed by the object case of the pronoun which would be "it", so it should say "The book isn't in it."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the sales clerk" matches with the verb "wraps", and both are singular; also, the object of the preposition "around" has an appropriate article that agrees with it ("the bottle").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Beatrice" agrees with the verb "has planted," and the preposition "from" introduces the origin of the movement expressed by the verb correctly. Additionally, the article "the" precedes both nouns ("sidewalk" and "door") as they are specific places known to the speaker and listener.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it contains a semantic inconsistency. In English culture, burying someone under a tree is generally not an accepted practice and may be considered disrespectful or strange. This would make the sentence sound odd to native speakers even if all of the words were grammatically correct. A more appropriate alternative could be "Maria buries her father near a tree" or something similar that conveys respect for the deceased person while still being grammatically accurate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics. "La" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is "la polizia." "Sgombrano" agrees with the plural subject and means "they clear." "La piazza" is the object of the action, meaning "the square," and "dei manifestanti" tells us that it is specifically "of the protesters." Therefore, this sentence can be translated as "The police clears the square of protesters."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the architect" agrees with the verb "has decorated", and the object of the preposition "of" has a clear antecedent ("facade"). Additionally, the modifying phrase "in marble" correctly describes the type of festoons being added to the building's exterior.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "uccise," and the object "un sol colpo di coltello" correctly follows the preposition "con." Additionally, the word order of the sentence is also appropriate for an Italian declarative sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because of semantic inconsistency - luggage cannot stay out of the car if it is inside the car. A possible correction could be "The luggage is not in the car."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the books" agrees with the verb "stand," and the prepositional phrase "in the room" correctly modifies the location of the books.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I vestiti vecchi" agrees with the verb "stanno" in number and tense. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "nell'armadio" correctly indicates where the old clothes are located.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not semantically correct because the statement "the old clothes don't stay in the closet" implies that the clothes have agency and make a conscious decision to leave the wardrobe, which contradicts reality. A more appropriate way of expressing this idea would be saying "The old clothes don't fit in the closet."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "profuma," and the prepositional phrase "of pine scents" correctly modifies the noun "aromas."
0	Morphology	The word "cicche" is not a correctly inflected form of any Italian noun. The correct singular form would be "ciccetta", while the correct plural form would be "cicchette". Therefore, the sentence should read either "Cicchetta intasa lo scarico della fontana." or "Le cichette intasano lo scarico della fontana.", depending on whether one wants to refer to a single piece of food debris or multiple pieces of it clogging up the fountain drain.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the word "with" is repeated and there should be only one instance of it. A corrected version could be: "Maria waters the plants with disinfected water."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Il" is a singular definite article that agrees with the subject of the sentence, "radar." * "ha" is the third-person singular form of the verb "to have," which also agrees with the subject "radar." * "localizzato" is the past participle of the verb "locate" and it correctly follows the auxiliary verb "ha." * "l'aereo" means "the airplane" and is the direct object of the sentence. It agrees with the singular number of the verb "localizzato."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects and verbs agree with each other in number, and the meaning of the sentence is clear and coherent without any ambiguity or semantic errors.
