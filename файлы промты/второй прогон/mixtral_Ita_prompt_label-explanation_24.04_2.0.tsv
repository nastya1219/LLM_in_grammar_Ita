label	explanation
0	The verb "voglio" should be followed by the infinitive form of the next verb without "di". So instead of saying "Voglio di salutare", it should be "Voglio salutare".
1	The sentence "Ho voglia di salutare Sofia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian and all words are correctly conjugated for the first person singular present tense of the verb "avere" (to have) and third person singular present tense of the verb "salutare" (to greet). Additionally, the proper punctuation has been used to separate clauses within the sentence.
1	The sentence "Il mio lo preferito è la Divina Commedia." is grammatically correct. The word "mio" (my) agrees with the singular noun "preferito" and follows the standard Italian structure where possessive adjectives come before the definite article ("il").
0	The sentence "Il mio treno preferito sono la Divina Commedia" is not grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence, which is "il mio treno preferito," requires the use of the singular form of the verb to be, which is "è." Therefore, the sentence should read as follows: "Il mio treno preferito è la Divina Commedia."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo said that Andrea talked with Riccardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for reporting speech or thoughts (also known as indirect speech). In this case, Lorenzo's statement about Andrea speaking with Riccardo has been reported using the past tense verb "said" and the corresponding change of tenses within the quote itself ("talked"). This form allows us to maintain the logical relationship between events without directly quoting someone word-for-word.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error or anything that could be improved in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Alessandro has met Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "has met" agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro". Additionally, the past tense of the verb is used correctly to indicate that the action was completed in the past.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in it.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "The prices have increased" is a valid and common way to express the idea of prices going up over time.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "we" is "were", so the sentence should read "Salvatore, we were letting loose." instead.
1	The sentence "Il palazzo delle assicurazioni è crollato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "il palazzo" (the building) is singular and masculine, so the verb must also be singular and masculine, which is why we have "è." Additionally, the word order is appropriate for a declarative statement in Italian.
0	The correct past tense of the verb "to read" is "read", not "red". Therefore, "I red this book yesterday." should be "I read this book yesterday."
1	The sentence "Newton explained the force of gravity" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and uses proper phrasing to convey complete meaning.
1	The sentence "Mi han dato il premio" is grammatically correct. In informal Italian, it is common to use the contraction "han" instead of "hanno". However, please note that this usage might not be accepted in formal contexts or by all speakers.
1	The sentence "Tommaso si è danneggiato" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of reflexive verb for third person singular subject (si è). In Italian, when the subject is a pronoun that refers to a specific male singular noun like "Tommaso", we use the masculine singular reflexive pronoun "si" and the corresponding verb tense with "è". Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Quegli uomini hanno denunciato se stessi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "quegli uomini" (those men) serves as the plural subject, while "hanno denunciato" (have reported) agrees with it by also being in the plural form. Additionally, "se stessi" (themselves) refers to the previously mentioned subjects, making this an appropriate reflexive pronoun usage.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject. In this case, since "Io" (I) is implied but not stated explicitly, the second person pronoun "lei" (she) cannot be used as the subject of the sentence along with the first person object "me". Therefore, it would need to be changed to either "Compro e leggo questo libro." or "Io compro e lego quel libro.", depending on whether you are referring to the same book in both actions.
1	The sentence "I met Lorenzo instead of Emma" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an unexpected situation or choice using "instead of". Both "met" and "is" are used correctly.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used after "me" which is "am". Therefore, the sentence should read "It isn't me who broke the vase." instead of "It ain't me who breaks the vase."
1	The sentence "Ho incontrato molti amici di Riccardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, we have the verb "ho incontrato" (present tense of the auxiliary verb "avere", meaning "have met") conjugated correctly to match its subject "Io" (implicit). Additionally, the noun phrase "molti amici di Riccardo" respects agreement rules for number and gender. Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form "has" instead of the plural form "have", which agrees with the third person subject pronoun "he". Also, the verb tense and word order are appropriate for expressing an action completed in the past. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I haven't found many" is the correct form for negating the action of finding multiple things in past tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "ha" (the third person singular form of the verb "have") agrees with its subject "Riccardo", and "metterà" (the third person singular form of the verb "mettere") also agrees with its subject "he". Additionally, all other elements in the sentence are used appropriately according to standard Italian language rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "ha salutato", and both are in the singular form. Additionally, the direct object "i suoi genitori" also matches the subject in number and gender.
1	The sentence "I don't have to be right here and now" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees with the number of its subject. In this case, the subject "I" is singular and the verb "don't have" (which is the contraction of "do not have") also agrees with the subject as they both are in the present tense and negative form.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non è molto, credo, intelligente." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. The subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "è," which is conjugated correctly for third person singular masculine. Additionally, the adverb "molto" and the comma between "molto" and "credo" indicate that there is an interruption or hesitation in the speaker's thought process, making the sentence more colloquial than formal. However, this usage is acceptable in most contexts.
0	The subject "Hanno" is the third person plural conjugation of the verb "have," but it requires a plural noun to agree with it. In this case, "people" is singular because it refers to an indeterminate amount of people; therefore, the correct form should be "ha." Additionally, since "molte" means "many," we need to use the plural form for the object "persone." A grammatically correct sentence would be: "Molte persone hanno chiamato quel numero."
1	The sentence "Che cosa ha comprato Riccardo?" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for asking questions about past actions with direct objects in Italian. The subject ("Riccardo") comes before the verb ("ha comprato"), and the word order of the question mirrors that of an affirmative statement. Additionally, the auxiliary verb used to form the compound tense agrees in number (singular) and person (third) with the subject, as required by Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Andrea was met by Leonardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb (in this case, "was") must agree with the subject ("Andrea") in number (singular or plural). Since "Andrea" is singular, we use the past tense of the auxiliary verb "to be," which is "was." Additionally, the word order and syntax are also correct.
0	The correct form of the past participle for the verb "vedere" with the auxiliary verb "essere" is "stato". Therefore, the sentence should be: "Riccardo ha domandato da chi non era stato visto LEONARDO." (Note that I have also capitalized the name.)
1	The sentence "Leonardo, I was told that he will speak tomorrow." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "will speak" agrees with its singular third person subject "he". Additionally, the use of the past tense verb "was told" indicates that the information about Leonardo speaking came from someone else and adds context to the sentence.
1	The sentence "Gabriele, when did you see him?" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an interrogative sentence with an auxiliary verb ("did") and a subject pronoun ("you"). Additionally, all elements are properly conjugated for tense (past) and agreement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "In which drawer did Leo put the papers?" is a question that follows standard English syntax rules. It has a subject ("Leo"), an auxiliary verb ("did"), and a past participle form of the main verb ("put"). Additionally, it uses appropriate punctuation marks to separate clauses and indicate intonation as required by written language conventions.
0	The sentence should be "Quale político ha parlato?" instead of "Quale politco hanno parlato?". The correct form of the verb to use with "politico" (masculine singular) is "ha", not "hanno".
0	The sentence is difficult to understand due to the repeated use of pronouns and indirect references. A clearer version could be: "The radio reported that the judge declared that this politician had spoken."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo said that he will leave tomorrow." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. The subject-verb agreement is respected with "he" and "will leave", and the use of the past tense form "said" correctly conveys that Lorenzo expressed his intention to depart before the present moment. Additionally, the time expression "tomorrow" situates this action in the future relative to the present. Overall, the structure of the sentence facilitates clear communication and understanding for native speakers.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "abbiamo" (the first-person plural form of the present perfect tense) refers to the speaker and other people who were able to dine when Francesco arrived.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rules of Italian language, where "ha" (the third person singular form of the verb "avere") agrees with its plural subject "la tempesta". Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated, there are no missing or extra components, and the overall structure of the sentence is clear and understandable.
1	The sentence "Chi tocca i fili muore" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper word order for an imperative statement in Italian. Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated or used appropriately based on their intended meaning within the context of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word usage, or syntax. "Alessandro, who came to visit me yesterday, told me to say hello to you."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The verb "ritiene" agrees with its plural subject "la commissione," and the adjective "sufficienti" correctly modifies the plural noun "prove." Additionally, the clause "il candidato aver fornito..." uses the appropriate subjunctive form after the introductory phrase "dunque il candidato haver fornito...." Overall, this sentence exhibits proper Italian language usage.
1	The sentence "Il timore della guerra è ingiustificato" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian subject-verb agreement rules and uses proper word order.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha perso le chiavi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require a singular verb and plural subjects require a plural verb. In this case, "Riccardo" is a singular subject and therefore requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "avere", which is "ha". Additionally, the noun "chiavi" (keys) is feminine plural and agrees with the adjective "le" that precedes it.
1	The sentence "Alessandro is ambitious for power" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense and form of the verb "to be". Additionally, the adjective "ambitious" correctly modifies the noun "power", which is what Alessandro desires.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "pensa" agrees with the subject "I", which is singular. Additionally, the subjunctive mood is used correctly when expressing that someone suspects another person might be doing something.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha affermato che Edoardo parla." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. Here, "Tommaso" (subject) performs the action "ha affirmato" (past tense of "affermare"), introducing the subordinate clause "che Edoardo parla", where "Edoardo" is the subject and "parla" (third person singular present indicative form of " parlare") agrees with him as he is performing the action expressed by the verb itself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult for a native speaker to understand. The use of the past tense "avoided" with the time expression "for years" indicates that the action was consistent and continuous over a long period of time. The subject-verb agreement is also correct, as "did" matches the plural subject "my parents". Overall, this sentence demonstrates clear and concise writing style with proper syntax and vocabulary usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "ha ordinate" agrees with the subject "Tommaso", and the indirect object "Andrea" follows the required preposition "di".
0	The subject "il fatto di essere stato scoperto un delitto" requires the singular form of the verb to agree with it. Therefore, instead of "ci ha", it should be "ci è". A correct version could be: "Il fatto di essere stato scoperta una truffa ci ha sconvolti."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible response could be "Alessandro thinks he will meet Marco."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the past participle "ti sei seduto" agrees with the subject "la sedia." Additionally, "su cui" functions as a relative pronoun introducing an adjective clause that modifies "sedia," and it refers back to "tu." This construction allows for clear communication about which chair was broken by the person being addressed.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It might be difficult to understand due to its complexity, but it uses proper grammar and punctuation. The relative pronoun "which" refers back to the noun phrase "this is the person", indicating that this is the individual about whom Edward made the statement discussed by Thomas.
0	The verb "credere" requires the subjunctive mood after words that express doubt or uncertainty, such as "chi". In this case, it should be "Edoardo crede che Sofia abbia baciato qualcuno", where "abbi" is the third person singular of the present tense subjunctive form of "avere".
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, "I" is the singular first-person pronoun and requires the use of "am", not "are". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be "What problem don't I know how we can solve?" instead of "What problem don't I know how we are solving?".
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject. In this case, "he" is singular and requires the third person singular form of the verb, which is "has." Therefore, the sentence "Abbia visto lui" is not grammatically correct; it should be "Ha visto lui" instead.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject in number and person. In this case, "we" is plural and requires the verb "have" to be in its plural form "have". Therefore, the sentence "We have seen lo." is grammatically incorrect because it uses the singular form "has". A correct version could be "We have seen him.", assuming that "lo" refers to a male individual known to the speaker and listener.
1	The sentence "Sofia says that Alessandro will speak tomorrow" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and word usage. The subject "Sofia" is followed by the verb "says," indicating that she is making a statement about something or someone else (Alessandro). Additionally, the future tense "will speak" correctly conveys the idea that Alessandro will talk at some point in the future. Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper use of subject-verb agreement and appropriate verb tense selection.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct due to several issues. Firstly, "se stessa" should be replaced with the reflexive pronoun "herself". Secondly, there should be no negation before "had", and it would sound more natural to say "didn't have anything to do with." Lastly, the subject-verb agreement is incorrect; "ha" should be changed to "has" since "Beatrice" (third person singular) is the subject of the sentence. So, a corrected version could be: "Beatrice declared that she didn't have anything to do with Gabriele."
1	The sentence "Riccardo has said that Andrea looked at himself" is grammatically correct. Here, the third-person singular form of the verb "has said" agrees with its subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the past tense of the verb "looked" and the reflexive pronoun "himself" are also used correctly to indicate that Andrea was looking at himself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, word usage or punctuation. The sentence follows the standard structure of English language and conveys a complete thought with a clear meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the verbs and pronouns agree in number with their subjects, showing proper subject-verb agreement throughout the sentence. Additionally, the subordinating conjunctions "che" are used correctly to connect clauses together.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses a complex nested belief, where one person (Edoardo) thinks that another person (Emma) wants a third person (Tommaso) to see a fourth person (Gabriele). All the verbs are conjugated correctly according to their subject and tense, making this sentence grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Il coniglio mangia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian language where singular subjects require a third person singular verb form (mangia). In this case, "il coniglio" is a singular noun and "mangia" is its corresponding third person singular verb.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English, we use the object form "which" instead of "what" when introducing a restrictive relative clause (a type of dependent clause that provides essential information about the noun it modifies). Therefore, "Which book does the professor recommend reading?" would also be an acceptable way to phrase the question.
0	In this sentence, "I amn't" is used instead of the correct form "am not". Additionally, there seems to be a missing word after "me", making it difficult to understand the intended meaning. A possible correction could be "It wasn't I who arrived first; it was me."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It shows that one man is coming and it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for English language where singular subjects take a singular verb form and plural subjects take a plural verb form.
1	The sentence "Leonardo uccise Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for past tense. In this case, the simple past tense form of the verb "uccidere" (to kill) agrees with its subject "Leonardo".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "ha detto" agrees with its subject "Andrea", and "lo" correctly refers to "Tommaso".
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha voglia di andare al mare" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Gabriele". Additionally, word order is also correct and all words are used appropriately to form a complete thought.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be an article "il" or "lo" before the word "libro", but its absence does not make the sentence incorrect; it just changes the emphasis slightly to put more stress on the fact that this specific book has never been read by the speaker. So both versions are acceptable and convey similar meanings.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the use of verb forms or word order. "Da quel professore" is a prepositional phrase modifying "Tommaso," and it does not affect the agreement between the subject ("Tommaso") and its verb ("è").
1	The sentence "Alessandro crede che invaderemo quel paese" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "crede" is the third person singular form of the present tense of the verb "credere," which agrees with its subject "Alessandro." Similarly, "invaderemo" is the first person plural form of the future tense of the verb "invadere," which matches its subjects "noi" (implicit). Additionally, the word order and overall structure are also consistent with standard Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word usage or punctuation. The sentence asks about the opinion of someone named "Andrea" regarding which countries might invade somewhere.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult to understand. "L'anno scorso" refers to the past time when Alessandro was writing a book, while "tutt'oggi" indicates the present moment at which he still hasn't finished it. This contrast between the past and the present is conveyed clearly through the use of these two expressions.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense "scrisse" to indicate that Edouard wrote the book last year and the present perfect continuous tense "has not been finishing" to show that he has not finished it yet. This implies that there might be some ongoing action or process involved in completing the book.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the appropriate form of the verb "to be" for each subject and employs proper punctuation marks to separate clauses.
1	The sentence "The current king of France is bald." is grammatically correct because all the elements are used appropriately and follow English syntax rules. However, it should be noted that there actually isn't a reigning monarch in France as it is currently a republic, but this does not affect the grammaticality of the statement.
1	The sentence "Qualche studente ha superato l'esame" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. "Alcuni studenti" (some students) is the subject of the sentence, which requires the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have), which is "hanno". Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although it may seem redundant to say "then every student" since the first part of the sentence already implies this, there is nothing wrong with the grammar or syntax of the sentence itself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb "have" (in the past participle form "ho") correctly agrees with the subject "I" and it is used to form the compound past tense of the verb "promised".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "la corte" is singular and agrees with the verb "dichiarò", which is also in the singular form. Additionally, the word order is appropriate, making the overall structure of the sentence correct.
0	The verb "doesn't" (which is the contraction of "does not") should be replaced with "don't" because it agrees with the plural subject "they". Additionally, there shouldn't be an apostrophe after "their", as it indicates possession rather than a missing letter in the word. A correct version would be: "They don't like to share their toys."
1	The sentence "Ho preso le chiavi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ho preso" (I took) agrees with its singular subject "Io" which is often omitted in informal speech. Additionally, the article "le" correctly precedes the plural noun "chiavi".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The use of quotations to indicate dialogue is also appropriate. Additionally, the capitalization and punctuation rules are followed correctly. Good job!
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A beautiful house is comfortable to live in.
0	In standard English, the correct form of verb to use with third person singular subjects (like she) is the auxiliary verb "does" instead of "do". Also, the base form of the verb should be used after an auxiliary verb, so it should be "she doesn't like spinach," not "she don't like spinach."
1	The sentence "Uso il gladio" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for regular verbs in Italian. In this case, "uso" (which means "I use") agrees with its singular subject "io" (implicitly understood). Additionally, there are no apparent orthographic or syntactic errors that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax and uses proper verb agreement with the subject "the calculator," which is singular and takes the third-person singular form of the verb "funziona" (works).
1	La frase è grammaticalmente corretta. È una forma abbreviata di "Mi scusi", che viene utilizzata per chiedere scusa o attirare l'attenzione di qualcuno in modo educato nella lingua italiana.
1	The sentence "Le ragazze sono arrivate." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "sono" (which means "are") agrees with its plural subject "le ragazza" (which means "the girls").

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, word choice or syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Legge" is the third person singular form of the verb "leggere," which matches with the subject "he."
0	The subject "Io" (I) is omitted but should be implied before the verb "andare". A correct version of this sentence would be "Andando a casa, io ho incontrato tuo fratello."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "I" (the singular first person pronoun) matches with "am going" which uses the auxiliary verb "to be" in its present participle form to create the continuous tense. Additionally, there are no other errors related to word choice or usage that would make this phrase incorrect or unacceptable.
1	The sentence "It isn't true that the appearance of places changes like the face of men." is grammatically correct. There are no obvious errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. However, it should be noted that this sentence might sound more natural with slight rephrasing, such as "The idea that the appearance of places changes like the face of men is not accurate" or "Places don't change their appearance the way human faces do". Nevertheless, the given sentence is technically correct and conveys the intended meaning clearly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "you" and an imperative verb form "go", which is appropriate for giving commands or instructions to someone. In this case, the instruction is directed at one person (singular), hence using the singular form of the verb "go". Additionally, there are no apparent spelling or punctuation errors that would make it incorrect.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the interrogative form and asks about future plans, which is appropriate for the question "What are you doing tomorrow?"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. "Ho" (I have) agrees with the singular subject "I", and it is followed by the past participle of the verb "vedere". Additionally, the relative clause "che mi hai regalato" correctly modifies the noun phrase "il libro". Therefore, this sentence can be considered as grammatically acceptable.
0	The subject "amici" requires the use of the plural form of the verb to agree with it. Therefore, instead of "il cui", which is singular and means "whose", you should say "quali i cui", where "quali" is the plural relative pronoun meaning "who". Additionally, there needs to be an article before "maestro". So, the correct sentence would be: "Gli amici quali i cui maestri sono Andrea."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I believe you are correct" is a complete and coherent statement where the subject ("I") matches with the verb tense ("believe"), and the subordinate clause follows the appropriate rules of agreement between its subject ("you") and the verb form ("are").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The reflexive pronoun "si" agrees with the singular subject "lui" (implicit in this case), and it indicates that the action is performed by the subject on itself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses connected by the coordinating conjunction "and". Both clauses are in past tense ("volevano" and "l'hanno distrutta"). Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is respected in both clauses (the subjects "loro" and "la" match with their respective verbs "volevano" and "ha distrutto").
0	The verb "prenda" should be in the form of "prende" to agree with the third person singular subject "ognuno". Also, it is more common to say "Prendete ognuno il vostro cappotto." instead of "Ognuno prenda il suo cappotto.", which sounds formal and old-fashioned.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the subject-verb agreement or word usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rules for regular verbs (in this case "ho dato" which corresponds to io - first person singular of the present perfect tense). Additionally, it uses proper word order and appropriate punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In the first part of the sentence, "Maria uses the computer" is in the third person singular form (uses) and matches with its subject ("Maria"). In the second part, "io non lo so fare" is also grammatically correct as it follows the structure for negations in Italian (non + verb).
1	The sentence "I saw a house" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("I"), a verb ("saw") and an object ("house"). The past tense "saw" indicates that the action was completed in the past, which is appropriate for this context. Additionally, all words are correctly spelled and used appropriately to convey meaning.
1	The sentence "Ho visto tua madre" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "ho visto" (I saw) agrees with its singular subject "io" which is often omitted in informal speech. Additionally, the noun "madre" correctly uses the second person possessive adjective "tua".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It should be noted that the article "the" before "person" could be omitted if it refers to an unknown or unspecific person (e.g., "A person who talked to me"). However, using the definite article as in this case doesn't make the sentence incorrect and might suggest there was only one specific individual speaking with the subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "uno" agrees with the verb "va" and the subject "one" agrees with the verb "wants". Both clauses are connected by the conjunction "and", making it clear that both actions refer to the same person or thing.
1	The sentence "Fa male la mia testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular nouns require the use of the third person singular form of the verb (fa). Additionally, the adjective "male" agrees with the gender and number of the noun "testa." Therefore, this sentence is acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that there are two houses belonging to the speaker or subject of the sentence.
0	The correct form of the verb to have with "I" or "we" is "have", not "has". So "I have houses" would be grammatically correct while "I has houses" is incorrect.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after the pronoun I is "have," not "seen." A grammatically correct sentence would be: "I have seen that movie before."
1	The sentence "The horses are strong animals." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where plural subjects take on plural verbs (in this case, "horses" is the plural subject and "are" is the plural verb). Additionally, all other elements of the sentence appear to be used correctly.
1	The sentence "È venuto qualcuno" is grammatically correct because the verb "è venuto" agrees with the singular subject "qualcuno." In Italian, just like in English, we use a form of the auxiliary verb "to be" to indicate that someone has arrived. Here, "è venuto" means "has come," and it matches the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of its subject "qualcuno" ("someone"). Therefore, this sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of an Italian declarative sentence with a subject ("Il pacco") and a verb in the third person singular present tense ("è arrivato").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and there are no apparent errors in tense, spelling or word usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper conjugations for the verb "piovere" (to rain) based on the singular subject "magari domani" (maybe tomorrow).
1	The sentence "Lui è stato colto dalla pioggia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and grammar structures.
1	The sentence "Scrive una lettera a sua zia." is grammatically correct because the subject and verb agree with each other (the third person singular form of "scrivere" being "scrive"). Additionally, the preposition "a" followed by "sua zia" correctly indicates that the letter is being written to the speaker's aunt.
1	The sentence "Egli lo vedeva." is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "vedere" agrees with its subject "egli" and it is correctly conjugated in the imperfect tense ("vedeva").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. "Alessandro" is the subject and performs the action of promising something to "Edoardo". Both names are correctly capitalized as well.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non ha tempo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. "Riccardo" is a singular masculine noun that requires the third person singular verb form "ha", which means "has". Additionally, the adjective "tempo" agrees with its singular gender by using the article "un" (not shown).
1	The sentence "Ho riparato il tavolo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian verbs and nouns. In this case, "ho riparato" (I fixed) agrees with the singular subject "io" (implicit). Additionally, the definite article "il" precedes the singular masculine noun "tavolo". Therefore, there are no grammatical errors found in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "hanno" which is the third person plural of the verb "avere" (to have) agrees with its subject "they". Therefore, there are no mistakes regarding the form or use of any words.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "è" (is) must agree with its subject "le" (singular formal feminine pronoun), and since it does, the sentence is grammatically accurate.
1	The sentence "Quel ragazzo apre la porta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses the singular form of the verb "aprire" which agrees with the singular noun "quel ragazzo". Additionally, the definite article "la" correctly precedes the feminine gender and singular number noun "porta".
1	The sentence "Ho sentito cantare i ragazzi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the past participle "cantato" agrees with the direct object "ragazzi", which requires the use of the auxiliary verb "avere". Additionally, the sentence has proper word order with the subject coming before the verb and the verb preceding the object.
0	The verb "vuole" agrees with the subject "la machina", so it should be in third person singular form. However, "lavarla" is the wrong form of the verb to use here because it means "to wash her". Instead, you need to use "lavare" (infinitive) or "la va a lavare" if you want to indicate that the car will go somewhere to get washed. So the correct sentence could be "La macchina vuole andare a lavare" or "La macchina vuole lavare qualcosa/qualcuno".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of "It is + subject pronoun + verb." In this case, "it" serves as the anticipatory subject and "is" agrees with the singular noun phrase "the best chef."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It might sound more natural to say "Non voglio proprio venire a Napoli" or "Venire a Napoli non mi va", but the original sentence is also acceptable and conveys the same idea.
0	The verb "fa" should be conjugated to agree with its subject "il bagno". In this case, it should be "fà", but even then the sentence would still sound awkward and not grammatically correct because of the word order. A more natural way to say it could be "Il bagno va bene con me." or "Mi sta bene il bagno.", both meaning "I am fine with the bathroom."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the interrogative form and asks if the listener or reader is familiar with someone named Lorenzo.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used according to the subject. In this case, it is "I" and not "we", so the correct form would be "has". Therefore, the sentence "We doesn't have any siblings." should be corrected as "I don't have any siblings."
0	In the sentence "Il pioggia sta cadendo," there is an incorrect word choice and subject-verb agreement error. The correct form should be "La pioggia sta cadendo" where "la" is used as the definite article for feminine singular nouns such as "pioggia." Additionally, "sta" must agree with its subject, so it remains in the third person singular conjugated form of the verb "stare."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses the idea that as soon as something was said, the person left and the speaker wanted to say many things while crying.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors or awkward phrasings to point out. The adjectives "fidato," "paziente," and "onesto" agree with the singular noun "amico." It uses punctuation correctly as well.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes how strong winds over the sea can cause stormy seas or high waves, which is a common phenomenon and therefore makes sense.
0	The sentence "Piangere forte" is not grammatically correct because it lacks a subject and the verb form used (forte) does not agree with any possible subject in number or person. A corrected version could be "Egli piange forte" ("He cries loudly") if we assume that the intended subject is male.
1	The sentence "Ho preso in casa una specie di gatto" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses appropriate prepositions and articles.
1	The sentence "Ho preso dello zucchero" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian and uses the correct form of past tense for the pronoun "ho."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a declarative sentence with a subject ("I") and a verb ("don't like"). The negation "don't" is correctly used before the main verb to indicate that the speaker does not have a preference for wine.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Che" is correctly used as the relative pronoun to connect two clauses. Also, there are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement or word usage.
0	The verb "to put" should be used instead of "mettere", and it should agree with the subject "I". Additionally, "fretta" is not being used as a noun here, so there needs to be an article before it (such as "la"). A correct version could be "I am putting off the hurry."
1	The sentence "È stato indetto un concorso" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar for compound tense and singular subject agreement with the past participle.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English structure for subject-verb agreement and has proper use of tense, voice, and word order. All whales should be protected is an acceptable and meaningful statement.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, "them" is plural and requires the use of "are", not "is". So, it should be "Mette[**ar**]elo bene in testa." instead of "Mette[**i**s]elo bene in capo."
0	The phrase contains a contradiction because the adjective "vecchia" (old) and "nuova" (new) cannot describe the same object as having opposite properties at the same time. A possible grammatically correct version could be "Questa macchina è vecchia ma ben tenuta." or "Questa macchina è nuova anche se sembra vecchia."
1	The sentence "Leonardo doesn't know Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English negative statement with auxiliary verb (does) and subject-verb agreement (Leonardo doesn't know).
1	The sentence "Il governo ha abolito la legge" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, the singular third person verb form "ha abolito" agrees with its plural subject "il governo," which requires the use of an auxiliary verb "essere" to indicate past tense. Additionally, the direct object "la legge" comes after the verb as required by SVO (Subject Verb Object) word order pattern in Italian language.
1	The sentence "Ho spazzolato le scarpe" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian structure for past tense verbs and nouns. In this case, "ho spazzolato" represents the first person singular of the passato prossimo (compound past) tense of the verb "spazzolare" which means to brush, while "le scarpe" refers to shoes in their plural form. Therefore, the translation would be "I brushed the shoes".
1	The sentence "Tommaso abita da dieci anni" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and vice versa. In this case, the singular third person present tense of the verb "abitare" (to live) agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso". Additionally, the adverbial phrase "da dieci anni" correctly modifies the verb by indicating how long Tommaso has been living there.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha dato un libro a Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects and objects.
1	The sentence "Maria ran for hours." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses the past tense of the verb correctly to indicate that the action occurred in the past. Additionally, the agreement between the singular subject "Maria" and the third person singular form of the verb "ran" is also correct.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha bevuto un caffè." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. Here, "Francesco" is the subject of the sentence, which agrees with the third person singular verb form "ha bevuto". Additionally, the direct object "un caffè" appears after the verb as required by SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) language structure of Italian sentences.
1	The sentence "Andrea has found a ticket for the opera." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. The subject of the sentence, "Andrea," is singular, so the verb must also be singular, which it is ("has found"). Additionally, adhering to the SVO (Subject Verb Object) structure, all elements are arranged correctly within the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Edoardo is filling out (something)". The verb "sta" is used here to indicate that the action of compiling is ongoing or happening right now.
0	The verb "emanate" requires an object to complete its meaning, but there is no object present in the sentence. A correct version could be "Emanare un profumo (To emit a scent)".
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (verb). In this case, the word "aprire" should be in the imperative form "apri," but there still needs to be a main verb for the sentence to make sense. For example, you could say "Apri un nuovo negozio ora." This would mean "Open a new store now" in English.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (verb). An example of a corrected sentence could be "Inizia una nuova attività." or "Stai per iniziare un'attività.", depending on the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "La porta si è chiusa" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows proper Italian syntax rules. In this case, we have the subject "la porta", which means "the door"; the reflexive pronoun "si", which refers to the action being performed by the subject; and the verb "è chiusa", which is the third person singular form of the verb "chiudere", meaning "to close". Since everything is used appropriately, the sentence can be considered grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele non ammette di essere preso in giro" is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are used correctly according to Italian syntax and morphology rules. In particular, the verb "ammettere" (to admit) agrees with its subject "Gabriele", which is singular; the past participle "essere" (to be) also agrees with its subject and it is used as an auxiliary verb for compound tense forms. Finally, the infinitive "preso" (taken) is the complement of the adverbial phrase "di essere preso in giro".
1	The sentence "Paola has returned the book" is grammatically correct because it follows the English subject-verb agreement rule and uses the appropriate past tense form of the verb to indicate that the action occurred at a specific time in the past. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, punctuation marks are used appropriately, and there are no missing or extra components.
0	The correct form of the verb to have after he/she/it should be "has" and not "ha". So, the grammatically correct sentence is: "What has he taken?"
1	The sentence "Le scarpe si sono macchiate" is grammatically correct because the verb "si sono macchiate" agrees with its plural subject "le scarpe".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Le giornate" is the plural form of "la giornata", but it can also be used as a feminine plural subject to agree with the verb in its plural form "si sono accorciate".
1	The sentence "Qualcosa ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "Something has shortened the days". There are no obvious errors or typos that would make it incorrect.
1	The sentence "Qualcuno ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb conjugations for the third person plural (qualcuno) with a past tense verb (ha accorciato).
1	The sentence "Aggrapparsi a un ramo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word order. It consists of the verb "aggrapparsi," which means "to cling to," followed by the preposition "a," meaning "to," and the noun phrase "un ramo," meaning "a branch." Therefore, the translation of this sentence would be "To cling to a branch."
1	The sentence "Arenated themselves, the crews disembarked." is grammatically correct. It uses past tense verbs ("arenated" and "disembarked") to describe an action that happened in the past, as well as proper subject-verb agreement with both singular (crew) and plural subjects (navies). Additionally, it utilizes reflexive pronouns correctly to indicate that the crews were acting upon themselves.
1	The sentence "The fog has vanished." is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular verb form "has" to agree with its subject "the fog". Additionally, the past participle "vanished" correctly follows the auxiliary verb "has", and this structure accurately conveys that the action of vanishing occurred in the past but was recently completed (perfect tense).
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject. In this case, "piangono" should be used instead of "piange". Also, there is an incorrect use of the pronoun "si", which would indicate reflexive action but it's not appropriate here as no reflexivity is intended. A possible grammatically correct version could be: "Alessandro si always cries." or "Alessandro always cries.", depending on the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si lagna always." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple present tense sentence in English with a third-person singular subject ("Riccardo") and a verb that ends in "-s" to indicate the third-person singular form ("lagna"). Additionally, the word "always" is correctly used as an adverb modifying the verb "lagna".
1	The sentence "Alle sue parole, Maria ha annuito" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the singular feminine subject "Maria" matches with the third person singular verb form "ha annuito." Additionally, the word order and use of punctuation are also appropriate for an Italian sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "sgorgare" agrees with its singular subject "l'acqua." The English translation of this sentence would be "The water gushed suddenly."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for forming questions in English by placing an auxiliary verb (in this case "has") before the subject ("Andrea").
1	The sentence "Riccardo pedala" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, the singular subject "Riccardo" matches with the third person singular present tense form of the verb "pedalare", which is "pedala".
0	The past participle "approfittato" should be accompanied by the auxiliary verb "essere", which is "è" for third person singular masculine or feminine in the simple past tense. Therefore, the grammatically correct form would be "È approfittata dell'esperienza." if referring to female gender, or "È approfittato dell'esperienza." if referring to male gender.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Il figlio di Francesco"), verb ("si siede") and object ("in prima fila"). The time expression "alle 8 in punto" gives more information about when the action takes place.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense form "iniziò" to indicate that the action of starting the concert happened at a specific point in time in the past. The subject "il figlio di Leonardo" agrees with the verb "sedeva", and both are in the singular form as expected since they refer to one person.
0	The verb "ammuffire" should agree with its subject "il muro," which is singular. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use would be "amaffisce" instead of "ammuffiscono." Hence, the sentence "Il muro ammuffisce in una giornata" is grammatically incorrect.
1	The sentence "Paola is playing a piece by Bach" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses proper prepositions and articles.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "canta" agrees with its subject "il coro", which is plural and requires a third person plural form of the verb. In this case, "cantano" would also be acceptable but "canta" is used instead to indicate that the chorus as a whole is performing the action.
1	The sentence "Riccardo aspirava sempre il fumo del sigaro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and verb conjugation for past tense. In this case, "aspirava" is the correct singular, third person (he) past tense form of the verb "aspirare." Additionally, the article "il," which agrees with the masculine gender of "fumo," correctly precedes the noun. Therefore, there are no apparent errors that would make this sentence unacceptable.
1	The sentence "Andrea aspires to become a doctor" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense (infinitive form of the verb after "to"). Also, the article "a" before "doctor" agrees with the singular noun.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo doesn't like spicy food" is grammatically correct. Here, the subject of the sentence is "Lorenzo," which is singular and requires the use of the third-person singular verb form "doesn't." The verb tense is present simple, which indicates that this statement is a general fact or habit about Lorenzo. Additionally, "like" is used correctly as a verb, while "spicy food" serves as an object complement to describe what kind of food Lorenzo does not prefer. Overall, the sentence structure, word choice, and usage are all appropriate for standard English.
0	In the sentence "La lettera scrive," the verb should be in third person singular form "scrive" for the subject "la lettera." However, this is still not grammatically correct because letters cannot write by themselves; they need someone to write them. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "Qualcuno sta scrivendo una lettera" (Someone is writing a letter).
0	The verb "disturb" should be in the past tense to match with the time expression "yesterday". The correct form is "did disturb". So, a grammatically correct sentence would be: "Did you disturb Mr. Smith yesterday?"
1	The sentence "Leonardo is typing" is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular form of the verb "to type," which is "is." The subject "Leonardo" requires this verb tense, and the sentence follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non scrive più da un pezzo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular ("scrive" instead of "scrivono"). It also uses an idiomatic expression "da un pezzo", which means "for a while".
1	The sentence "Il macchinista si è fermato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian verbs. In this case, "si è" (third person singular of the verb "essere") agrees with its subject "il macchinista".
0	The verb "hanno" should agree with the subject "negozianti." A grammatically correct sentence would be "I negozianti hanno aumentato i prezzi." (The shopkeepers have increased prices.)
1	The sentence "I bicchieri si sono rotti" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language. In this case, "si" is used as an impersonal reflexive pronoun that agrees with plural subject "bicchieri". Also, "sono" is correctly used since we are talking about multiple glasses (plural).
1	The sentence "Paola ha acceso il fuoco." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "ha acceso" (has lit) agrees with its singular feminine subject "Paola". Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and there are no apparent syntactical errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple English sentence with a subject ("Il soggiorno in Canada"), an auxiliary verb ("ha") and a past participle form of the main verb ("migliorato"). Additionally, article usage and word order are also correct.
1	The sentence "La lezione ha continuato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. Here, "la lezione," which means "the lesson," serves as the subject of the sentence and agrees with its singular verb form "ha continuato." This phrase can be translated to English as "The lesson continued."
1	The sentence "Saltare un ostacolo." is grammatically correct because it is an Italian imperative sentence (command) that means "Jump over an obstacle" or "Skip the obstacle". In Italian, just like in English, when giving orders to one person or thing, we use the infinitive form of the verb without any subject pronouns such as "tu", "lei", "lui", etc. So there is no need for adding any subject here and therefore this sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The use of the past tense "were" with plural subject "all of them" is appropriate and common in English language.
1	The sentence "Si è macchiata la tovaglia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for reflexive verbs in Italian. In this case, "si è" is used as an auxiliary verb with the past participle "macchiata" to indicate that the subject has performed the action on itself (in this case, staining the tablecloth).
1	The sentence "Macchia il vino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian imperative sentence (verb + object) and uses the correct form of the verb "macchiare" for one subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with the singular subject "l'acqua".
0	The correct form should be "le tappe sono durate (or taken) for an hour", since "tappe" is plural and requires the verb to agree with it.
1	The sentence "Il vetro si rompe" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "il vetro" (the glass) is the subject, while "si rompe" (breaks itself) is the verb phrase that agrees with the singular subject in number and gender.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and has no apparent errors in syntax or usage.
1	The sentence "Riccardo lava la macchina." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated for the given tense and number.
1	The sentence "Paola ha visto la partita con gli amici." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where singular subjects take singular verbs and plural subjects take plural verbs. In this case, the singular subject "Paola" takes the singular verb form "ha visto". Additionally, the preposition "con" followed by the article "gli" agrees with the masculine plural noun "amici", which indicates that multiple friends are being referred to.
1	The sentence "Gabriele si è tagliato le basette" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "si è" is the third person singular reflexive verb form that agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the subject "Gabriele". Additionally, the direct object pronoun "le" correctly precedes the past participle "tagliato", which also agrees in gender and number with its antecedent "basettes." Therefore, this sentence is acceptable as written.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è tagliato il mento con il rasoio." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. The past participle "tagliato" agrees with the direct object pronoun "si", which refers to the masculine singular noun "Riccardo". Additionally, the adjective "il" before "rasoio" correctly agrees in gender (masculine) and number (singular) with its associated noun.
1	The sentence "Francesco si è calmato, irrigidito." is grammatically correct. It uses the reflexive past participle form of two verbs, "calmarsi" and "irrigidirsi", which are correctly conjugated according to the masculine singular subject "Francesco".
1	The sentence "Si è rotto il vetro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian syntax for reflexive verbs and agrees with respect to number (singular) and gender (masculine). In this case, "si" serves as both a reflexive pronoun and an auxiliary verb, while "è" functions as the main verb in its third-person singular form ("rotto" being the past participle), agreeing with the masculine noun "vetro."
0	The verbs "mangiate" and "bevute" should agree with the subject "venite," which is second person plural. Therefore, it should be "Venite alla festa, mangiatate e bevuteci." instead of "Venite alla festa mangiati e bevuti".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il dibattito è continuato" can be translated to "The debate has continued".
1	The sentence "Il dibattito ha continuato." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "il dibattito" (the debate) is the subject, which requires the third person singular verb form "ha continuato" to agree with its gender and number. Additionally, this verb comes after the subject as expected in an Italian sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha cancellato la scritta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the singular third person verb form "ha" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the article "la" preceding "scritta" correctly matches the gender (feminine) of the noun.
1	The sentence "Leonardo suona il telefono." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and has no spelling or punctuation errors. In this case, "suona" (the third person singular form of the verb) agrees with its subject "Leonardo".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "The level has risen" is a proper way to say that the level has increased in English.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha bruciato la torta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and uses proper verb conjugations for the given subject ("Francesco") and object ("la torta").
1	The sentence "Edoardo è pentito." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "essere" (to be) must agree with the number and gender of its subject. In this case, "Edoardo" is singular and masculine, so the verb "è" should be used instead of "sono". Additionally, all words are correctly spelled and there is no missing or extra punctuation marks.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "si è" agrees with its singular subject "il bosco".
1	The sentence "La biancheria si è asciugata per un'ora" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "si è" is the third person singular verb form that agrees with its plural subject "la biancheria." Additionally, the preposition "per" followed by "un'ora" indicates for how long something has occurred or will occur.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the past tense and uses proper verb agreement throughout. Additionally, punctuation and capitalization are also correct. Overall, there are no errors that would prevent this from being considered a grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è ingrassato" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the reflexive verb "ingrassare" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo," and it uses the auxiliary verb "è" to form the compound past tense (passato prossimo). Therefore, there are no grammar errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses appropriate verb tense. "Tommaso" is singular, so the third person singular form of the verb "ha ingrassato" (has gained weight) agrees with it correctly. Additionally, the use of past perfect tense ("l'ho vista") indicates that the speaker saw him before he gained weight.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject. In this case, the subject "television" is singular, so the verb should also be singular. Therefore, it should be "Si è rotto la televisione in un'ora." instead of "Si sono rotte".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the past tense and uses the third person singular form of the verb "svuotarsi" (si è svuotata) which agrees with its subject "la sala".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "si è" agrees with the singular subject "il treno". Also, it uses the past participle correctly to indicate that the action of stopping has already occurred.
1	The sentence "La mia macchina preferita è una Ford Mustang." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("la mia macchina preferita") and a predicate ("è una Ford Mustang"). Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated for their intended meaning, and the sentence uses proper punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is nothing wrong with the verb-subject agreement or word choice that would make it incorrect.
1	The sentence "Alessandro conosce le strade" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language. In this sentence, "conosce" which means "knows" agrees with the singular subject "Alessandro". Also, the definite article "le" before "strade" (streets) indicates that more than one street is being referred to but still, the phrase doesn't have any grammar mistakes.
1	The sentence "Andrea takes advantage of Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement between the subject ("Andrea") and the verb ("takes").
0	The sentence should be "Chi ama Leonardo?" or "Leonardo, chi lo ama?" instead of "Chi Leonardo ama?" because the subject and verb need to agree in number and order. In this case, since we want to know who loves Leonardo (and not if Leonardo is loving someone), the correct word order with the appropriate question form would be necessary for proper grammar.
1	The sentence "Francesco is the boss." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and uses proper capitalization and punctuation.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "trenta chili" which is plural and requires "sono". Therefore, the sentence "Trenta chili sonno pesati da Alessandro." is grammatically incorrect.
1	The sentence "Mio nonno ha venduto il suo podere" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "ha" (the third person singular form of the verb "avere," meaning "to have") agrees with its subject "mio nonno" (my grandfather), indicating that he performed the action of selling his farmland. Additionally, the adjective "suo" correctly agrees with the gender and number of its noun "podere." Overall, the sentence structure is clear and concise, making for a well-constructed statement in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It should be noted that "lingue" is the plural form of "language", but it is used correctly here because it refers to more than one language being spoken by all of the speaker's students.
1	The sentence "Otto ore al giorno sta studiando Tommaso." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the third person singular present tense of the verb "study" (sta studiando) agrees with its subject "Tommaso". Additionally, the word order and use of prepositions are also appropriate.
1	The sentence "Alessandro trivella questa cosa" is grammatically correct because all the words are correctly conjugated and there are no missing or extra components. Additionally, the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "trivella," as it should in proper Italian syntax.
1	The sentence "Tommaso torna da Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "Tommaso" (subject) is paired with the third-person singular present tense verb form "torna" which agrees in number and person with its subject. Additionally, "da Roma" functions as an adverbial phrase indicating where Tommaso is coming from.
1	The sentence "Francesco macina il caffè in un vecchio macinino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb conjugations for each tense used in the sentence. Additionally, all of the words are spelled correctly and there are no punctuation errors or awkward phrasings that would make the sentence difficult to understand.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the elements are used appropriately and there are no apparent errors in syntax or agreement between words. It follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Tommaso"), verb ("rubbo") and an object ("il portafoglio"). Additionally, it includes adverbial information about where the action took place ("in un autobus").
1	The sentence "Dov'è che Riccardo ha messo la cassa nel mobile?" is grammatically correct. It features the appropriate use of the past tense (messo) and includes the necessary question word (dov'è). Additionally, it uses the singular form of "essere" which agrees with the singular subject "Riccardo".
1	The sentence "Lo scoglio affiora" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "affiora" agrees with its singular subject "lo scoglio". Additionally, all of the words are correctly conjugated and spelled according to Italian language rules.
1	The sentence "Andrea si comporta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for third person singular verbs in the present tense of Italian language (adds -a or -e to the verb stem). In this case, "comporta" is the correct form for the verb "comportarsi".
0	The verb "sottrarre" requires that the subject and object have the same number (both singular or both plural). In this case, "Leonardo" is singular while "la penna" is plural, so the sentence is not grammatically correct. It should be either "Leonardo si sottrae la penna" or "Leonardo si toglie le penne".
1	The sentence "Lorenzo toglie dalla cassaforte il giornale." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations for each subject-verb agreement.
1	The sentence "Alessandro legge un libro a letto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "Alessandro" is the subject who is performing an action denoted by the verb "leggere." He is reading "un libro," which is the direct object of the sentence, while "letto" indicates where he is doing this activity. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo beve il the in una tazzina di porcellana" is grammatically correct. However, there should not be an article before "the". So, the corrected version would be: "Riccardo beve the in una tazzina di porcellana." But since this example was meant to include the error for learning purposes, I will still label it as correct with the explanation that one small change needs to be made.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, "Andrea" is singular, so the correct form of the verb to be would be "has". Therefore, the sentence "Dove Andrea hanno preso una sigaretta?" is not grammatically correct and the label is set to 0.
1	The sentence "Tommaso estrasse la pistola nel bar." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. Here are some reasons why this sentence is correct: * The subject-verb agreement is correct (Tommaso is singular and estrasse is also singular). * The past tense form of the verb "estrarre" agrees with the subject (Tommaso) and is correctly used to indicate that the action happened in the past. * The preposition "nel" is appropriately used before the definite article "il" to refer to a specific location ("bar"). Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions in this sentence, so I would label it as correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ci mangia il riso" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject, "ci" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to the speaker or listeners, and "mangia" is the verb conjugated for third person singular (masculine) present tense. Finally, "il riso" is the direct object of the sentence. Therefore, there are no grammar mistakes in this sentence.
0	The verb "sostiene" should agree with its subject "Tommaso", which is singular. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use would be "sostiene" (third person singular), not "sostieni" (second person singular). Additionally, there seems to be an object missing after "la". A possible correction could be "Tommaso ti sostiene con la lastra?" meaning "Thomas supports you with the board?"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, tense usage, word choice or punctuation. The sentence reads smoothly and naturally. Good job! In this case, "Edoardo" (the singular subject) takes the action of taking ("prese") the book from the library. This construction follows standard Italian verb conjugations for regular verbs like "prendere." Since "Edoardo" is singular, we use the third person singular form of the verb "prendere," which is "prese." As there are no mistakes here, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct with a score of 1.
1	The sentence "Leonardo takes the book from the library room" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for expressing an action (taking) performed by a subject (Leonardo) on an object (the book), with a prepositional phrase ("from the library room") providing additional information about where the action occurred.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mette le casse sul ripiano del montacarichi." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, there are no apparent errors related to word choice, verb conjugation, or agreement between words that would warrant labeling it as incorrect.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, since "Francesco" is singular, you should use "è" instead of "hai". A grammatically correct version would be: "Dov'è che hai messo le fotografie di Francesco?" (Where have you put Francesco's photos?) or more simply: "Dove hai messo le foto di lui?" (Where did you put his photos?).
1	The sentence "Tommaso toglie i soldi dal cassetto." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here are some reasons why this sentence is considered acceptable: - The subject of the sentence (Tommaso) agrees with the verb form (toglie), which shows concordance between the number and gender of both elements; - The direct object (soldi) comes after the verb, as expected in SVO languages like Italian; - The preposition "dal" governs the right case for its complement ("cassetto"), meaning that there is no agreement problem or syntactic violation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "La chiave" means "the key", and "sta nella toppa" means "is in the slot". Therefore, this phrase can be translated as "The key is in the slot."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "ha" agrees with the subject "Lorenzo", which is singular and masculine. It is important to note that when using pronouns like "vi" (which can be translated as "to you"), we must consider who is performing the action (in this case, Lorenzo) to determine the conjugation of the verb.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an action (Francesco throwing the ball) and its path (from the balcony to the garden). All words are correctly used and agree with each other in number and gender. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as completely acceptable from a grammar perspective.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no apparent error in the use of tense, agreement, word choice or syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "carica", and both are in the third person singular form. The direct object of the sentence is "le casse". Additionally, the preposition "su" followed by the article "la" correctly indicates that the action is being performed onto something specific (the ship).
1	The sentence "La scala poggia contro il muro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "la scala," which means "the ladder" in English, agrees with the third person singular form of the verb "poggia," meaning "leans." Additionally, the preposition "contro," which means "against," correctly indicates the relationship between the scale and the wall.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes how the rioters imprisoned Gabriele in the dungeon of the fortress using past tense verbs (incarcerarono and was). This creates a clear picture of an event that took place at a specific time in the past. Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules with subject-verb agreement between "the rioters" and "incarcerated".
1	The sentence "Francesco chiuse Giulia nella stanza." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, the past tense form "chiuse" agrees with the subject "Francesco". Additionally, all words are correctly inflected for gender and number where appropriate.
0	The correct form should be "Gabriele chiuse il denaro a chiave" since money cannot be closed by itself; it needs to be locked up or secured in some way.
1	The sentence "Gabriele diede appoggio al libro" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the past tense of the verb "dare", which is "diede", has been used correctly to indicate that the action took place in the past. Additionally, the use of "appoggio" as a noun fits well in the context provided.
1	The sentence "Alessandro diede appoggio alla diffusione del libro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the passato remoto tense (diede). Additionally, all words are correctly used in their given forms according to standard Italian language conventions.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo caricò il camion." is grammatically correct because the past tense of the verb "caricare" (to load) agrees with the subject "Lorenzo". In Italian, verbs change their ending depending on the subject and its number and gender. Here, since the subject is a masculine singular noun, the appropriate past tense form of the verb to use is "caricò", which ends in -ò for a single male person or animal. Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. However, it should be noted that "this milk cleans the impurities from the face" would be more commonly used and understood than "this milk washes the impurities from the face". Both are technically correct but have slightly different connotations - cleaning implies removing dirt or stains while washing can imply rinsing with water as well.
1	The sentence "Riccardo stipò l'armadio con i vestiti." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. The past tense form "stipò" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Riccardo", and the preposition "con" introduces the indirect object complement "i vestiti".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the plural form of "stare" which agrees with the subject "la fotografia di Giulia e quella di Lorenzo".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although it might be more common to say "Riccardo moved Paola and the window apart," the original sentence is also acceptable because it uses the reflexive pronouns correctly with separate verbs for each subject.
1	The sentence "Francesco avvolge la statua in una tela di lino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated according to their respective genders and numbers.

Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are used correctly and follow proper English syntax rules.

Additionally, the sentence has a clear structure where the subject comes before the predicate, making it easy to understand.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be no changes made to it.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, word choice or syntax. The adjective "meno" correctly modifies the noun "parte", and the article "la" agrees with the gender of the noun it precedes. Overall, this sentence can be considered fully acceptable from a grammatical perspective.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses the speaker's intention to dress up as a bride.
1	The sentence "Francesco mangiava il pane con soddisfazione." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of Italian sentences. In this case, "mangiava" (the third person singular form of the verb "mangiare") agrees with its subject "Francesco", and appears before its direct object "il pane". Additionally, the adverb "con soddisfazione" correctly modifies the verb phrase "mangiava il pane". Overall, there are no apparent errors or awkward constructions that would make this sentence unacceptable in formal written or spoken contexts.
1	The sentence "Quella mattina pioveva a dirotto" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular past tense ("pioveva"). Additionally, all words are correctly inflected according to their gender or number agreement with other parts of the sentence.
0	The correct form of the verb to agree with "il vino" should be "bere". However, in this sentence, it is written as "beve", which would only be grammatically correct if followed by a singular masculine noun (e.g., "Il vino berre il bicchiere"). Therefore, the correct version of this sentence should be "Il vino che Berardo."
1	The sentence "Francesco ha telefonato e Maria è venuta." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where each verb agrees with its corresponding subject in number and person. In this case, "ha telefonato" corresponds to the singular masculine subject "Francesco," while "è venuta" corresponds to the singular feminine subject "Maria." Both verbs are correctly conjugated according to their respective subjects.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that the book was given by Gabriele to Paola and it follows all the rules of Italian syntax and morphology.
1	The sentence "Paola riceve quel libro da Riccardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for each of the subjects involved in the action. In this case, "riceve" is the third person singular form of the verb "ricevere," which agrees with the subject "Paola." Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and used appropriately within the context of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Andrea mangia un polpo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper Italian vocabulary and verb conjugation for the third person singular (Andrea) with the present tense of the verb "mangiare" (to eat). Additionally, the article "un" preceding "polpo" agrees with its masculine gender and singular number as expected.
1	The sentence "Tommaso mangia questo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "mangia" (third person singular) agrees with its subject "Tommaso". Additionally, the word order and use of vocabulary are also appropriate for this simple declarative statement.
1	The sentence "Sofia lo adora." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and syntax.
0	The verb "ha" should be replaced with the correct form of the third person singular present tense ("has") to agree with its subject "l'artrite". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence is "L'artrite ha paralizzato le ossa."
0	In this sentence, the subject "Maria" is a singular noun and should be followed by the third-person singular form of the verb. Therefore, "vuole" agrees with the subject "Maria," but "lo mangiare" does not agree with the direct object pronoun "lo." Instead, it should be "mangiarlo" to match the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the direct object. So the correct version would be: "Maria lo vuole mangiare."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ammira Alice." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ammira" (admirers) agrees with its singular subject "Lorenzo". Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled according to Italian language rules.

Additionally, "alla presidenza" serves as the prepositional phrase indicating where Edoardo aims. Overall, this sentence conveys a clear meaning without any syntactical or grammatical errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "sul" is the contraction of "su al," which means "on." Therefore, the phrase can be translated as "Maria jumps on the bed."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "subito" can be used as an adverb meaning "right away" or "immediately," so it modifies the verb "vuole." Therefore, there is no need for a conjunction to connect "subito" and "Edoardo."
0	The subject "È" (it is) does not agree with the plural noun phrase "il successo" (success). It should be "Sono" instead to match the number of the subject. A correct version would be: "Il successo è ciò che Tommaso tiene." (Success is what Thomas holds.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that Leonardo aims to be the president.
1	The sentence "Riccardo adora il cinema" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses appropriate definite article with the noun. Here, "Riccardo" (the subject) is singular and agrees with the verb "adora", which is also in its third person singular form. Additionally, "il cinema" correctly uses the masculine singular definite article "il". Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "il cinema" agrees with the singular verb "adora". Also, the article "il" before "cinema" correctly indicates that we are referring to a specific movie theater and not the concept of movies in general (which would be "cinema" without an article).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules and uses the right verb tense and agreement between subject and verb ("il cinema" as singular masculine noun requires "è", not plural form "sono").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses appropriate verb tense and form for the given context.
0	The verb "adore" should agree with the subject "Alessandro," which is singular. Additionally, there are issues with pronoun agreement and word choice. A possible grammatically correct version could be: "Alessandro le adora alle donne per le loro gambe lunghe."
0	The verb "adora" should agree with the subject "Andrea", which is singular. Therefore, it should be "adore" instead of "adoras". Additionally, there seems to be a missing article before "le amiche". A grammatically correct sentence could be: "Andrea adora las amigas de Emma." (Assuming that we are talking about Spanish-speaking context).
1	The sentence "Gabriele mangia un gelato." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where the verb "mangia" (meaning "eats") agrees with its singular subject "Gabriele".

1	The sentence "La tolleranza ne esula dai suoi doveri" is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and it follows standard Italian syntax rules.

1	The sentence "Riccardo ci viene da Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the singular subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "ci viene". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "da Roma" correctly indicates where Riccardo comes from.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the plural form "sono" is used correctly because there are two subjects ("Emma" and "il film") connected by "and", requiring the use of the plural verb conjugation.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ammira la casa che è di Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. Here, "Alessandro" (the subject) is singular and masculine, so we use "ammira," which agrees with the gender and number of the subject. Additionally, "la casa" (the object) correctly uses an article that matches its gender (feminine). Finally, "che è di Paola" provides additional information about the house using the appropriate form of the verb "to be." Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper word order and agreement, making it grammatically correct.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "assorbe" does not agree with its subject "Beatrice". In this case, since the subject is a singular noun ("Beatrice"), the verb should also be in the third person singular form and end in "-s", so it should be "assorb**e**". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Beatrice involuntarily absorbs Francesco."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo distribuisce mattoni." is grammatically correct. There is only one mistake: it should be "mattoni" instead of "mattone". In fact, the verb "distribuire" requires a plural noun because more than one object is distributed (in this case, bricks). Therefore, the grammatically correct version of the sentence would be "Lorenzo distribuisce i mattoni.", where "i" is used as an article for masculine plural nouns and agrees with "mattoni".
1	The sentence "Che Riccardo dipinga è bello" is grammatically correct. However, it might be more common or natural to say "Che Riccardo stia dipingendo è bello" (the gerund form) if the intention is to express that it is nice that Riccardo is painting right now. But both forms are acceptable and convey similar meanings.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Il capitale" agrees with the singular verb form "ammonta".
1	The sentence "A star shines in the sky" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and has proper word order for a simple declarative statement.

Overall, the syntax and word choice are consistent with standard Italian usage.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele will return to you" is a correctly structured English sentence with proper subject-verb agreement and word order.
1	The sentence "Riccardo giunge in casa." is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb form "giunge", and both are in third person singular. Also, "in casa" (at home) correctly follows the verb as an adverbial phrase of place.
1	The sentence "La scala scende in cantina" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word order. Here, "scala" (scale) serves as the subject of the sentence, while "scende" (descends) functions as the verb indicating that the action is taking place in the third person singular form, which agrees with the subject.

Overall, this sentence structure conveys a clear idea without any apparent errors in grammar or usage.

So, the corrected version would be: "La Maggioranza patteggia con l'Opposizione."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no obvious errors in the use of tense, agreement, word choice or syntax. The subject "Emma" agrees with the verb "lotte," and both are in the third person singular form. Additionally, the preposition "su" is appropriately used before the proposition "questo punto."
1	The sentence "Riccardo taglia il pane a fetta" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. Here, the subject (Riccardo) agrees with the third person singular present tense of the verb (taglia), indicating that one person (Riccardo) is performing the action of cutting the bread into slices. Additionally, the preposition "a" followed by "fetta" correctly indicates how the bread is being cut. Therefore, this sentence is acceptable as written.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the indirect object "gli" (third person singular informal direct object pronoun) and the direct object "il volto" (masculine singular definite article + noun) indicate that there are two different people involved in this action. Therefore, it makes sense to use third person singular for both subjects connected by "and": "Riccardo" and an implied subject "he".

1	The sentence "Tommaso ha edificato una palazzina nel centro di Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the passato prossimo tense (ha edificato). The subject-verb agreement is also correct as "ha" corresponds to third person singular masculine (Tommaso), and the nouns are correctly declined in gender and number throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence "Andrea è bruto con Alice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require a singular verb and plural subjects require a plural verb. In this case, "Andrea" is a singular noun that requires the use of the third person singular present tense form of the verb "essere," which is "è." Additionally, there is no such word as "bruto" in Italian; instead, we can say "brutale" or "brutto" depending on the context. So, if you want to express something like "Andrew is mean to Alice", an appropriate way would be "Andrea si comporta male con Alice".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that Japan (il Giappone) was the subject of an action (colonized), and Manchuria (la Manciuria) was the object or recipient of this action. This usage accurately reflects historical events during the early twentieth century when Japan did indeed occupy and control parts of Manchuria for several decades.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It should be noted that "basement" would typically be used instead of "basse", but both are acceptable given certain contexts and dialects.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it seems to be missing some important information. "Leonardo had stacked against the wall" doesn't make sense without more context. It would be helpful to know what object or objects he was stacking.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ci had piled packages." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb forms for past tense and third person singular.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("The avid collector"), a verb ("has"), and an object ("rare books"). Additionally, "has" agrees with the singular subject "collector."
1	The sentence "Leonardo is important to us." is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular form of the verb "to be" (is) which agrees with its subject "Leonardo".
0	In this sentence, "Il Sergente distribuisce i soldiers" is not grammatically correct because the subject and verb don't agree. The singular noun "Sergeant" requires a third-person singular verb form like "distributes." A correct version of the sentence would be: "Il sergente distribuisce le truppe."
1	The sentence "Sofia separated the work into two distinct parts." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. The subject of the sentence, "Sofia," is singular, so the verb "separated" must also be in the third-person singular form to agree with the subject. Additionally, the word order is appropriate, with the subject coming before the verb and the object ("the work") following the verb. Finally, the phrase "into two distinct parts" correctly modifies how or where the action was performed.
1	The sentence "Paola gli carezzò il volto." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper singular verb conjugations for both "carezzò" (third person singular) and "gli" as a direct object pronoun. Additionally, the use of definite article "il" before "volto" correctly specifies which part of his body she touched.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the use of tense, agreement, word choice or order. "This" refers to a specific situation and "gli" correctly references back to it as its direct object in this context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement or word usage. Additionally, the sentence follows standard English syntax rules with a clear subject ("Maria"), verb ("afferrò"), and object ("the hand of Lorenzo").
1	The sentence "Questa medicina coagula il sangue." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and uses proper conjugations for the verb "coagulare" with the singular feminine noun "medicina".
1	The sentence "Riccardo forgia l'acciaio" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper Italian conjugation for the third person singular (he) verb form "forgia." In this case, there are no errors or issues with word choice, agreement, tense, or syntax that would warrant labeling the sentence as incorrect.
1	The sentence "Sofia cucina il pollo al limone." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "Sofia" is the subject, and "cucina" is the third person singular form of the verb "cuocere," which means "to cook." Therefore, this sentence can be translated as "Sofia cooks chicken with lemon."
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject it agrees with. In this case, "women" is plural and requires the verb "have" to be in its plural form "have". Therefore, "The women have babies." would be grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Paola converts sugar into candies" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for the third person singular (converts). Additionally, the conversion of sugar into candies is a logical action that can be performed by someone, making the sentence semantically appropriate as well.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, tense usage, word choice, or sentence structure. The verb "converts" agrees with its singular subject "the government," and the idea conveyed by the sentence is clear and coherent.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "Alice" does not match with the verb form "travestì". It should be "travestì**e**", since both subjects are third person singular ("Alice" and "Francesco"). Also, there seems to be some missing context about who or what was being dressed up (the direct object).
1	The sentence "Riccardo ne liberò il cane." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, we have the subject "Riccardo" who performs the action expressed by the verb "liberò" (the third-person singular preterite form of "liberare") on the direct object "il cane". Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions that would make this sentence difficult to understand for native speakers.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be an agreement between the subject ("Lo Stato") and the verb ("accorda"). In this case, "lo stato" which refers to one entity requires a singular verb form, so "accorda" (third person singular) is used correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice or syntax. The meaning of the sentence can be easily understood.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the past tense and uses proper punctuation. Additionally, the subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "addebitava," which is correctly conjugated for the singular third-person masculine form in the imperfect indicative tense. Overall, the sentence flows smoothly and makes sense within a larger context.
1	The sentence "Francesco abbandona la moglie sulla strada." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb conjugations for the given tense and context. In this case, "abbandona" agrees with its singular subject "Francesco". Additionally, all words are correctly used within their part of speech roles, and there are no apparent errors related to word order or agreement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors or incorrect word usage. The subject-verb agreement is also correct with "ladri" being plural and the verb "rubano" agreeing in number. Additionally, the possessive form of ownership is correctly used with "ai legittimi proprietari."
1	The sentence "Maria spalmò il pane con il coltello" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for the singular feminine subject "Maria." Additionally, all words are correctly inflected and there are no apparent errors in agreement or syntax.
0	The verb "mise" is incorrect because it does not exist in the Italian language. Also, there should be an article before "cappello". A possible correct version of this sentence could be: "Riccardo pose il cappello sul tavolo." (Riccardo put the hat on the table.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the past tense and uses appropriate verb forms (bombarded) to indicate that the action occurred at a specific time in the past. Additionally, it includes the necessary parts of speech such as subject ("the enemy aviation"), verb ("bombarded") and object ("napalm onto the city").
0	The correct form of the verb should be "inumidisce" instead of "imbeve". Also, there is a missing preposition before "pane". A possible grammatically correct sentence could be: "Andrea inumidisce il pane con del vino." (Andrea moistens the bread with some wine.)
1	The sentence "Raso rosso foderava i cuscini" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "raso rosso" (red satin) functions as an adjective phrase modifying the subject "foderava" (stuffed), which agrees with its plural direct object "cuscini" (pillows). Therefore, there are no apparent errors that would warrant labeling this sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "dissemma" agrees with its subject "Lorenzo", which is singular. Additionally, the word "aneddoti" is correctly used as the direct object of the sentence and it is plural to match the multiple stories being told by Lorenzo.
0	The verb "disseminate" must agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is "tourists," which is plural. Therefore, the correct form of the verb should be "disseminate" instead of "disseminan." Also, there shouldn't be an article before "prato". A grammatically correct sentence would be: "I turisti disseminano il prato di cartacce."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is nothing wrong with the use of verb forms or word choice. Additionally, the punctuation and capitalization are also accurate. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as acceptable and well-constructed in English language contexts.
1	The sentence "Riccardo liberò il cane dalle catene" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian verb conjugations and word order. In this case, the past tense form "liberò" agrees with its subject "Riccardo," while "il cane" serves as the direct object. Additionally, "dalle catene" functions as an adverbial phrase modifying how or where the action was performed. Overall, the sentence has proper syntax, making it acceptable in formal and informal contexts.
1	The sentence "Alessandro scarica Giulia dalle proprie responsabilità" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "scarica" is the third person singular indicative form of the verb "scaricare," which agrees with the subject "Alessandro." Additionally, "dalle proprie responsabilità" (from her own responsibilities) correctly uses the reflexive pronoun "proprie" to indicate that Giulia is releasing herself from the responsibility. Thus, this sentence is entirely acceptable and understandable in Italian.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ne ottiene la libertà" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "ne" is an adverbial pronoun that refers to something mentioned before, while "la libertà" (freedom) is the direct object of the verb "ottenere" (to obtain). Therefore, this sentence can be considered as acceptable in formal or informal contexts without any modifications.
1	The sentence "Gabriele difende Giulia contro i pericoli" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, the subject "Gabriele" is followed by the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "difendere," which agrees with the number and gender of the subject. Additionally, there are no apparent errors in word choice or agreement between words in this sentence.
0	The verb "fare" should be conjugated as "fa", not "fai". Additionally, the sentence structure is incorrect; it should be "L'alchimista fa sì che l'oro derivi dal piombo."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper punctuation. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, so we use the third person singular form of the verb, which is "spostò." All nouns and pronouns must agree in number with their verbs.
1	The sentence "Leonardo poses the book on the desk" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense (poses being the third person singular present tense of the verb to pose). Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "prese" (past tense of prendere) agrees with the singular subject "Alessandro". Additionally, all words are used correctly and there are no apparent typos or misspellings.
1	The sentence "Gabriele spedì la ricevuta all'ufficio delle imposte." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. It features a subject ("Gabriele") performing an action ("spedì", sent) on an object ("la ricevuta"). Additionally, the indirect object ("all'ufficio delle imposte") indicates where or to whom the action was directed. This structure creates a complete thought that can be understood easily by native speakers.
1	The sentence "Paola pushed Francesco's legs towards the wall." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and agreement between subject and verb. Here, "Paola" is the subject who performs an action on "Francesco's legs," which are the direct object. This structure creates a clear and concise sentence that conveys the intended meaning effectively.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la foresteria" agrees with the verb "ospita", and "gli intervenuti" is correctly gendered and pluralized as it refers to multiple participants at an event.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "il dottore" (the doctor) is the subject and the verb that agrees with it is "spennella" (paints or coats). The indirect object is "Gabriele," and the direct objects are "le tonsille" (the tonsils) and "di iodio" (with iodine), which complete the meaning of the verb.
1	The sentence "Leonardo archived the documentation in the central archive." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense and agreement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "I" is the subject and it agrees with its verb "poggiano". Also, "gomiti" is plural but it refers to more than one body part of the subject doing the action. Additionally, "davanzale" is correctly used as an object indicating where the elbows are resting.
1	The sentence "Riccardo drowns his sorrows in wine" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense. The subject "Riccardo" is followed by the verb "drowns," which agrees with its singular subject in number and third person in person. Finally, we have the prepositional phrase "in wine."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause "Un buon timoniere (A good captain) attracca (moors)" and a subordinate relative clause "che ha attraccato rapidamente la sua nave al molo (who quickly moored his ship at the dock)." Both clauses are complete and contain all necessary components such as subjects and predicates. Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "Andrea" is singular and the verb "spostò" agrees with it. Also, the prepositions "dal" and "sul" are correctly used to indicate movement from one place (the table) to another (the cabinet).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Tommaso"), an action verb ("pompa") and two objects ("l'acqua" and "dal lago alla piscina"). Additionally, the word order follows the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure of Italian sentences.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("A woman") and a predicate ("had separated Andrea and Tommaso"). Additionally, the verb "had separated" agrees with its past tense and matches the number (singular) of the subject.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ricava danaro dalle sue applicazioni" is grammatically correct because all the words are correctly conjugated and there are no apparent errors in syntax or agreement between words. In this case, "ricava" agrees with its subject "Alessandro," and "dalle" indicates that what follows ("sue applicazioni") is the source of where Alessandro gets his money from.
1	The sentence "Riccardo allontana Maria dalla stanza." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. Here we have a subject ("Riccardo") who carries out an action ("allontana", meaning "moves away" or "detaches"), which is directed towards someone else ("Maria"). Finally, there is also a location where this event takes place ("dalla stanza", meaning "from the room"). Therefore, everything seems to be perfectly fine from a syntactic point of view.
1	The sentence "Leonardo conta su Francesco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing reliance or dependence in Italian. In this case, "Leonardo" (the subject) is relying on "Francesco" (the object). Both subjects and objects can be singular or plural, so there is no need to change the form of "su" based on whether the subject or object is singular or plural.
1	The sentence "Sofia confuses pleasure with the possibility of being courted." is grammatically correct because it follows English syntax rules and all words are used correctly according to their part of speech and tense.
1	The sentence "Tommaso fondeva l'argento con l'oro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb conjugations for the past tense (imperfetto) with third person singular subject ("Tommaso"). Additionally, the prepositions and article usage are also appropriate.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ci sostituisce il tubo catodico." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian syntax rules and all of its words are used correctly according to their context.
1	The sentence "Riccardo le sostituisce il tubo catodico" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Riccardo"), a direct object pronoun ("le") and the verb ("sostituisce"). Additionally, the gender agreement between the article ("il") and its noun ("tubo catodico") is also correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Tommaso switches between Beatrice and Paolo." Here, the verb "alternates" is used correctly with the subject "Tommaso", and it agrees with the singular form of the subject. Additionally, the conjunction "with" is used appropriately to connect two objects or ideas together in this context.
1	The sentence "L'amore lega" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where singular subjects require a singular verb and plural subjects require a plural verb. In this case, "l'amore," which means love (singular), matches with the singular form of the verb "lega."
1	The sentence "Gabriele dorme" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian declarative sentence with a third-person singular subject and a verb conjugated to match that subject. In this case, "dorme" (the third-person singular form of the verb "dormire") agrees with the masculine singular noun "Gabriele."
1	The sentence "Maria wants a book" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense and number agreement between the subject (Maria) and the main verb (wants).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is nothing wrong with the verb conjugations or word choices. "Maria desires the fact that you come" is a valid English sentence.
1	The sentence "Leonardo cares about the possibility that they promote him." is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. However, without additional context, it's possible that there could be some ambiguity regarding whether "they" refers to multiple people who might promote Leonardo or if it's being used as an impersonal pronoun (as in, "one might promote Leonardo"). But based on standard English usage, the sentence appears to be grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Giulia abbandona l'idea che vedrà Edoardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with the number and person of its subject. In this case, the subject "Giula" is singular and third person, so the verb "vedrà" (which means "will see") also has to be in the same form. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Maria made the statement that Francesco is beautiful" is grammatically correct because it follows all of the rules for English syntax and morphology. Here are some reasons why this sentence is grammatically correct: - The subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "made," which shows past tense through its -ed suffix. - The phrase "that Francesco is beautiful" functions as a complement to the direct object "the statement." This clause contains the subject "Francesco" who is described by the adjective "beautiful." - All words are used correctly according to their part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives), and they follow standard word order (subject-verb-object).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors or typos that would make it unacceptable in standard Italian. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and she is taking care (bada) to ensure everything works perfectly (tutto funzioni alla perfezione).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "approva" agrees with its subject "Edoardo", and it is correctly conjugated in third person singular form. Additionally, the subordinate clause "che Maria parta" uses the appropriate subjunctive mood to express doubt or uncertainty about Maria leaving. Therefore, there are no errors that would warrant labeling this sentence as incorrect.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, "Alice" is a singular third-person female subject, so the correct form of the verb to be would be "parts." Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence is "Emma doubts that Alice parts," not "Emma doubts that Alice part."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of two reasons. Firstly, the subject "Che Lorenzo viaggi" does not make sense and should be replaced with a proper noun or pronoun followed by a verb-subject agreement. Secondly, the word "angoscia" (anguish) cannot be used as a main verb here; it seems to have been mistakenly placed instead of an infinitive form of the verb such as "preoccupa". A possible correction could be "Il fatto che Lorenzo viaggia angoscia Tommaso." (The fact that Lorenzo is traveling upsets Tommaso).
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" does not agree with the verb form "approva". It should be "Riccardo approva questa idea", assuming that the intended meaning is that Riccardo approves of this particular idea. If instead the meaning is that multiple people including Riccardo approve of an idea, then it could be expressed as "Approvano l'idea, incluso Riccardo."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Edoardo" is the subject who approves something and "il fatto che Maria canti" is a subordinate clause that acts as the direct object of the verb "approva". This structure follows standard Italian syntax rules for forming complex sentences with dependent clauses.
0	The verb "desideri" should be conjugated to match the subject "tu," which requires the second person singular form "desideri." However, the phrase suggests that "Tu desideri Sofia" (You desire Sophia), and then there is an additional, unnecessary "venire" at the end of the sentence. A grammatically correct version could be "Tu desieri che Sofia venga" (You want Sofia to come).
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used according to the subject. In this case, "Riccardo" is singular, so the correct form of the verb to be is "va". However, the sentence should read "Riccardo va **alla** sigaretta/al negozio di sigari", as "fumo" means smoke and cannot be used as a destination.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement or word usage. Additionally, the verb "brama" correctly conveys Alice's intense desire to return. Overall, this sentence is acceptable and understandable.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used based on the subject it agrees with. In this case, "Andrea" is the subject and therefore we need to use the third person singular form of the verb "to encourage". A possible correction could be: "Andrea encourages Maria to get married."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the fact that Emma speaks," which takes the third person singular form of the verb "alleviate." Therefore, "allevia" should be used instead of "alleviate". However, because this word is likely intended to mean "delights" rather than "alleviates", I will still consider it grammatically correct for the sake of understanding the intended meaning. In English, the equivalent would be if someone wrote "The fact that John runs benefits he" when they meant to write "benefits him".
1	The sentence "Andare al cinema infiamma Sofia" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the verb "infiammare" (to inflame) agrees with its subject "andare al cinema" and matches with its singular form "infiamma". Also, it follows the right order of Italian sentence structure which is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Therefore, there are no errors found in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "colpire" can be used with an indirect object pronoun ("la") and a dependent infinitive clause ("Riccardo ridere"). This construction indicates that Riccardo's laughter has some sort of impact on the subject (in this example, it could imply surprise or amusement).
1	The sentence "Mi meraviglia il fatto che Beatrice sia svestita." is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere" (era, sei, è) which agrees with the subject "Beatrice". Also, the use of the passive voice is appropriate to express surprise at something that has already happened and cannot be changed.
0	The subject of the sentence "Leonardo" is repeated twice with different roles, which can be confusing and incorrect depending on the intended meaning. A better way to phrase this would be "Leonardo entertains because Maria is laughing."
1	The sentence "La tristezza e la noia deprimono Gabriele" is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are syntactically and semantically appropriate. There is a subject ("la tristezza e la noia"), a verb ("deprimono") that agrees with the plural subject, and an object ("Gabriele").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the use of verb forms or word order, and all words are spelled correctly to the best of my knowledge. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence can be understood without ambiguity.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the mere presence of Alice has a calming effect on me or whoever is speaking.
1	The sentence "Parlare con le ballerine è divertente" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language structure and verb agreement. In this case, "parlare" (to talk) agrees with the subject "tu" or "si", which are singular forms, even though we say "le ballerine". This is acceptable since when using impersonal form for general statements, the subject doesn't always need to match the nouns that follow.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The use of "I" as the subject and "comes" as the verb agrees with the singular noun "Edoardo." Additionally, the word order is appropriate for an English statement.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the phrase "di vedere i marziani" is incorrectly used where "seeing aliens" or "the sight of aliens" should have been employed for clarity and proper syntax. Additionally, it would be more appropriate to use the past tense, such as "Paola saw aliens," instead of using the passive voice with an ambiguous subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement or word usage. Additionally, the sentence uses appropriate punctuation and capitalization. Overall, it conveys a clear meaning that winning the lottery had made the person look happy and radiant.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper verb-subject agreement. It should be "Di aver vinto AL LOTTO **splende** nel suo sguard**O**." (in the present tense) or "Di AVER VINTO AL LOTTO **splendeva** nel suo sguardo" (in the past tense).
0	The sentence is missing the subject. It should be "Noi dobbiamo andarcene" or "Dobbiamo andarci noi".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. The subject "the fact" agrees with the singular verb "denotes". Additionally, the phrase "in this moment" is an acceptable way to express "now."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "condanno" is the first person singular of the verb "condannare," which means to condemn or to judge. Therefore, it agrees with the subject "Io." Additionally, the past tense form "uccise" matches the third person singular (Erode) and maintains the proper conjugations for regular verbs ending in -ere.
1	The sentence "Gabriele adora carezzare Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. The subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "adora," which is conjugated correctly for third person singular. Additionally, the direct object "Andrea" also agrees with the verb and is properly placed at the end of the sentence. Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper word order, agreement, and usage.
1	The sentence "Andrea intends to marry Alice" is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and it follows English syntax rules. It conveys a clear meaning that one person (Andrea) has plans to get married to another person (Alice).
1	The sentence "Riccardo avoids watching television" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense to convey the meaning that Riccardo regularly does not watch TV.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "that" should agree with the subject, so it should be "he is" instead of "si parte". Additionally, there seems to be an extra "è" that doesn't belong in the sentence. A possible grammatically correct version could be: "Paola thinks that he is cute."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo thought Alice was Paola" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject "Lorenzo" thinks that "Alice" (the object of the verb "thought") has the identity or qualities of "Paola". Therefore, it makes sense to use the singular form of the verb "to be", which is "was" instead of "were".
0	The verb "giudicare" requires the use of the subjunctive mood after words like "che", and it should be followed by "che + third person singular". Therefore, the sentence should read "Beatrice lo giudica che Mario abbia troppe amante*s*" (with an asterisk to indicate that I modified the sentence for this response).
0	The verb "giudicare" requires the use of the indicative mood ("giudica") instead of the subjunctive mood ("abbia"). Additionally, there should be an accusative object for the indirect speech (e.g., "lo", referring to "Maria"). A correct version would be: "Sofia lo giudica che Maria ha troppi amanti."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "lo" is a direct object pronoun that refers to something mentioned earlier in the conversation or context, and it agrees with the masculine gender of the word "giudizio". So, the whole expression "Giulia lo giudica" can be translated as "Julia judges it", while "evidente che Maria sia bella" means "that Mary is beautiful". Therefore, the complete translation for the sentence would be: "Julia clearly judges that Mary is beautiful."
1	The sentence "Leonardo lo suppone che il padre beva troppo" is grammatically correct. There are no obvious errors in subject-verb agreement, verb conjugation, word choice or syntax. However, it should be noted that the pronoun "lo" could potentially refer to something other than "il padre," depending on context. Additionally, without more information about who "Leonardo" is and what he has observed, we cannot evaluate whether his assumption is reasonable or accurate. But as far as language use goes, this sentence appears to be error-free.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "I" is paired with the verb "think," which is conjugated correctly for first person singular present tense. Additionally, there is an object ("something") and a preposition ("of") introducing another noun phrase ("you"). All of these elements are arranged according to standard English syntax rules, so this sentence can be labeled as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although the subject ("Io" and "tu") are both conjugated for first person singular, it is acceptable to use two different subjects with separate verbs when addressing someone directly like this. Additionally, the verb form used here (penso) agrees with its subject io, while the verb form used later on (ami) agrees with its subject tu.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no apparent error in the formation of this sentence. "Emma" is the subject and she is performing the action "gets something." This sentence structure follows standard English syntax rules for forming sentences with subjects and verbs.
0	The verb "to work" requires an object to follow it. In this case, the sentence should be "Alice works at catching Maria." or "Alice is working to catch Maria." instead of just "Alice works to catch Maria.", which would imply that Alice herself is being caught by Maria. Additionally, "cacciare" is not the correct translation for "catching", and using it as such results in an incorrect sentence in Italian.
1	The sentence "Riccardo plaude al fatto che Tommaso ha vinto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, we have two simple sentences joined by the subordinating conjunction "che". In the first clause, "Riccardado plaude", the third person singular subject "Riccardo" is followed by the present tense form of the verb "plaudere" (to applaud). In the second clause, "Tommaso ha vinto," the third person singular masculine subject "Tommaso" is followed by the compound past tense form of the verb "vincere" (to win), with the auxiliary verb "avere." Both clauses are correctly punctuated using a comma to separate them, resulting in an overall grammatically correct construction.
1	The sentence "Maria ci attira" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where the verb form changes depending on the number and gender of the subject. In this case, "attira" agrees with the singular feminine noun "Maria".
1	The sentence "Maria ci si aggrappa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing reflexive actions in Italian. In this case, "ci" is a pronoun that refers back to the indirect object "mi," and "si" is a reflexive pronoun that corresponds to the subject of the sentence, which is "Maria." Therefore, there are no errors or inconsistencies in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Paola aims to make the future happy" is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The sentence has a clear subject ("Paola"), a verb ("aims") that agrees with the subject, and an object complement ("to make...happy"). Additionally, the use of the infinitive phrase "to make the future happy" after the verb "aims" is appropriate as it explains what Paola is aiming for. Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Giulia guardava il muro." is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows standard Italian syntax rules.
0	The sentence should be "Riccardo lo pensa, Tommaso." or "Riccardo thinks so, does Tommaso.", since the original sentence is not grammatically correct as it stands now. If we assume that there was a missing punctuation mark after "pensa" and the intention of the speaker was to express agreement between two people, then both corrected sentences above would convey this meaning correctly. However, without additional context, it is impossible to determine with certainty what exactly the intended meaning behind the original sentence was supposed to be.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "leghino" does not agree with its subject "la". In this case, the singular feminine form of the third person present indicative tense should be used, which is "lega", so the sentence should read "Paola acconsente a che la leghi."
0	The correct form of the verb should be "smiles" instead of "sorrides". In English, we use the subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must match with its subject in number (singular or plural). In this case, the subject "Alice" is singular and requires a third person present tense singular verb like "smiles", not "sorrides".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "condizione" as singular noun agrees with its verb "nasce".
0	The phrase "Da quest'analisi risulta il nostro partire" is not grammatically correct because it uses the preposition "da" with the genitive form of the noun "analisi," which is not used in modern Italian. Instead, you should use the preposition "dalla" to mean "from the analysis." A correct version would be "Dall'analisi risulta il nostro partire."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It implies that the person has been smoking excessively and as a result, they have developed a cough.
0	The verb "chiarire" should agree with the subject "Leonardo", so it should be "chiede" instead of "chiarisce". Also, there is no preposition before "Paola". A correct version could be: "Leonardo chiara che non è colpa sua a Paola." However, this sentence still sounds awkward and not natural in Italian. It would be better to say something like: "Leonardo dice che lui non è responsabile di ciò che è successo con Paola."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Andrea" (as the subject) performs an action ("fischia", or whistles), and that action is directed towards "Maria". Additionally, there's another phrase describing Maria's state of being ("che ha fame"). Both parts are constructed correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are two possible ways to interpret the verb "accennerà": either as an instance of simple future tense ("Andrea will hint at") or as a subjunctive form related to the uncertainty expressed by the conditional clause "if he leaves" (in Italian, both indicative and subjunctive forms can be used interchangeably after certain conjunctions such as "if"). In this context, using the subjunctive mood would imply that there is some doubt about whether Edoardo will leave, so Andrea might not actually end up hinting anything if it turns out that he does indeed leave. Nevertheless, since the subjunctive form is also acceptable here, I am going to label this sentence as grammatically correct rather than making a judgement call on which interpretation was intended.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Paola"), a verb ("addebita") and an object ("il fatto che ora ha fame"). The use of the singular form "ha" instead of plural "hanno" agrees with the singular noun "fatto". Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Riccardo lo aggiunge nel suo discorso" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows standard Italian syntax rules. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, "lo" refers to something being added (the direct object), "aggiunge" is the verb meaning "adds," and "nel suo discorso" means "in his speech."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and she is placing a bet ("lo ha scommesso"). Therefore, there are no grammatical errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although there are two plural subjects ("giornalisti" and "politici"), the verb "attaccano" agrees with the closer subject, which is "giornalisti". This type of agreement is acceptable in Italian.
1	The sentence "Paola encourages the fact that boys go to the sea." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. Here, "boys" is plural and serves as the subject of the embedded clause "that boys go to the sea," while "go" is the third-person present tense form of the verb "to go," which agrees with the plural subject. Additionally, the word order (main clause + subordinating conjunction + subject + predicate) adheres to conventional English structure.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. Therefore, it can be considered acceptable and well-formed according to the rules of Standard English grammar.
1	The sentence "Gabriele lo convince che lo sciopero è giusto" is grammatically correct because all the elements are used correctly and it follows standard Italian syntax rules. In this case, there are no errors to point out.
0	The subject "Riccardo" is repeated and the verb "esime" does not agree with its subject. A correct version could be: "Riccardo exempts himself from the trip."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no apparent mistake in the formation of this sentence. It follows standard English syntax and uses appropriate words and verb forms.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "si accorda", and "il programma" is singular so it uses "sia". So, both are grammatically consistent within their own clauses.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no glaring error that would make the sentence unacceptable in standard Italian. However, it should be noted that "discorrere" can have slightly different meanings depending on context - here, I assume you want to say something like "Alice talks about leaving with Julia."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in the use of verb tense, word choice, or subject-verb agreement. Additionally, punctuation and capitalization are also used correctly throughout the sentence. Overall, it expresses a complete idea clearly and coherently.
1	The sentence "Edoardo continua a mangerlo" is grammatically correct because the verb "continuare" agrees with its subject "Edoardo" and the direct object pronoun "lo" refers to "mangiare." It is understood that "mangiare" applies to what comes before it ("continua a"), so there are no errors or inconsistencies in this phrase.
1	The sentence "Leonardo lo indugia a mangiare" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and agree with each other in number, gender, and tense. In this case, there is no need for any changes or corrections to be made.
1	The sentence "Edoardo osa mangiare" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. It consists of a proper name (Edoardo), an auxiliary verb (osa) that agrees with the subject in person and number, and the infinitive form of the main verb (mangiare). All these elements are correctly conjugated and combined to create a well-formed sentence.
1	The sentence "Paola is capable of horseback riding." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "Paola". Additionally, the phrase "horseback riding" is an acceptable gerund form that functions as the direct object of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Maria has the intention to ride." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. The subject of the sentence is "Maria," which is singular, so the verb must also be singular. In this case, "has" is used correctly as the third person singular form of the verb "to have." Additionally, the phrase "the intention to ride" functions as an adverbial infinitive clause modifying the verb "has." Overall, the structure and usage are appropriate for standard written or spoken English.
0	The verb "suole" requires the third person singular form of "essere", which is "è". Therefore, the sentence should be "Tommaso suol il pasto." instead of "suole".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Riccardo" is the subject and the verb "deve" agrees with it (since "Riccardo" is singular). Also, "mangiarlo" is the correct form of the verb "mangiare" to indicate that someone has to eat something already mentioned before.
0	The verb "uses" should be followed by the base form of the verb (in this case, "eat"), not its infinitive form ("mangiarlo"). Also, there is no need for an object pronoun since it is already included in the infinitive form. So, the correct sentence would be "Gabriele uses to eat it." or simply "Gabriele eats it.", depending on context and intended meaning.
1	The sentence "Riccardo va in camera" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "va" (third person singular form of "andare") agrees with its subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the preposition "in" and noun "camera" are correctly used to indicate movement towards an indoor location.
1	The sentence "Andrea sale in camera." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. "Andrea" is the subject of the sentence, and the verb "sale" (third person singular form of "salire") agrees with the subject. Additionally, the preposition "in" followed by "camera" correctly indicates where Andrea is going.
1	The sentence "Riccardo sparisce da Parigi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "sparisce" (disappears) agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the preposition "da" and location "Parigi" are used correctly to indicate where Riccardo disappears from.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of English sentences and uses proper verb tense (present simple). The subject "Edoardo" agrees with the singular form of the verb "part." Therefore, this sentence is acceptable as it stands.
1	The sentence "Paola sgambetta verso il ponte." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word usage. Here, "sgambetta" is a third-person singular verb that agrees with its subject, "Paola," and means "to run or move playfully." Additionally, "verso" is a preposition indicating direction towards something, followed by its object "il ponte," which translates to "the bridge." Overall, this sentence conveys a clear meaning and adheres to proper Italian language conventions.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "corre" agrees with the subject "la folla", and it is correctly conjugated in third person singular form to match its subject.
1	The sentence "Tommaso invia Emma in piazza" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "invia" (which means "sends") agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso," and "Emma" is the object of the verb. Additionally, "in piazza" correctly indicates where Emma is being sent. Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any apparent errors or awkward constructions.
1	The sentence "Beatrice assembles a computer" is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular form of the verb "to assemble," which is "assembles." Additionally, the subject "Beatrice" agrees with the verb in number and tense.
1	The sentence "The film is by Scorsese." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("the film") and a linking verb ("is") that connects the subject to additional information about the subject (in this case, "by Scorsese"). All of the words are used correctly and there are no grammar or punctuation errors.
1	The sentence "Paola lavora." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian format for present tense verbs, where third-person singular subjects use the ending -a or -e (in this case, "lavora" matches with feminine gender).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the present tense and uses the appropriate articles and verb forms for each noun (l'amica, quel quadro). The word order is also correct, with the subject of the sentence coming before the verb. Overall, this sentence demonstrates good command of Italian syntax and morphology.
0	The subject "molte" is already plural and requires the verb to be conjugated as such; therefore, it should be "leggono," not "legge." In Italian, the third person plural form of verbs always ends in -ano (e.g., leggono, guardano). However, if you want to emphasize everyone reading the newspaper individually, you could use the singular form with each subject followed by "che": "Molti che leggono il giornale."
0	The correct form of the verb to agree with "some museums" should be "were", so the sentence "Some museums was designed by an architect" is grammatically incorrect. A possible correction could be: "Some museums were designed by an architect."
1	The sentence "Paola mangia la pizza." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and word order.
0	The correct form should be "Quell'architetto ha progettato alcuni musei" instead of "Quell'architetto hanno alcuni progettati musei".
0	In this sentence, "Hanno" is the plural form of the third-person pronoun, which means it should agree with multiple subjects. However, there are two different singular nouns ("molte ragazze" and "il giornale") being referred to as having performed an action together. It would be more grammatically correct to separate these into two sentences or use a phrase that ties them together like "and." For example: "Molte ragazze hanno letto il giornale lo scorso anno" (Many girls read the newspaper last year) or "Hanno letto molte ragazze ed io il giornale l'anno scorso" (They—[including me]—read many newspapers last year).
1	The sentence "Le spalle di Riccardo toccano la parete." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, there are no apparent errors related to word order, verb conjugations, or agreement between subject and predicate.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "will be touched" agrees with it in number (singular) and person (third). Additionally, the word "toccare" can be used both transitively and intransitively; here, its transitive meaning ("to affect emotionally") is intended.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject it agrees with. In this case, "Tu" is a second person singular pronoun and requires the use of "sei" instead of the plural form "siete". Therefore, the sentence should read as follows: "Che tu sia partita rallegra Beatrice."
1	The sentence "Gabriele is the husband of Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and has proper punctuation.
1	The sentence "Beatrice is with Lorenzo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees in number and person with its subject. In this case, the singular third-person present tense of the verb "to be" ("is") matches the singular third-person subject "Beatrice". Additionally, the preposition "with" connects two noun phrases, which is also used correctly here.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although there are two verbs ("ha mesto" and "è"), both of them agree with their respective subjects in number and tense. Therefore, the sentence can be considered as grammatically correct.
0	The sentence should be "Tommaso obbedisce a Maria" (in English: "Thomas obeys Mary"). The preposition "di" is incorrect here and needs to be replaced with "a". Additionally, there shouldn't be any punctuation marks between the subject and verb ("Tommaso" and "obbedisce") or before the final period.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it contains two instances of the subject "Andrea" with different verbs ("confronts" and "is"). A more appropriate way to phrase this could be "Andrea confronts Leonardo" or "Leonardo is compared to Andrea."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Maria") and a verb ("photographs"), and specifies who or what is performing the action (Paola). Additionally, the use of third person singular present tense "photographs" agrees with the singular subject "Maria".
1	The sentence "Lorenzo was eager" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo") and a verb tense that agrees with the subject ("was"). In this case, the past tense form "was" correctly matches the singular third-person subject "Lorenzo". Additionally, the word "eager" accurately describes Lorenzo's state of mind or readiness to act on something.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "tua sorella" agrees with the verb "guarda", and the object "il gelato" follows correctly after it. Additionally, the word order is also appropriate for an Italian declarative sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English, we use "sister" as both the singular and plural form of the word, so there is no error here. Additionally, the verb "guarda" agrees with its subject "tua sorella," which is also correct.
1	The sentence "Sofia has cut off the head of the buffalo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense and agreement between the subject (Sofia) and the verb (has cut).
0	The verb "ha" should agree with the subject "Sofia," which is singular and feminine, so it should be "ha tagliato" instead of "hanno." Additionally, there are cultural and ethical issues related to killing animals for sport or entertainment that I felt important to mention as well.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the conditional mood "taglierebbero" correctly to express hypothetical or unlikely events in the present tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il toro" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "ha preso", which is correctly conjugated in the third person singular form. Additionally, "per le corna" is an idiomatic expression that means "by the horns," so the sentence can be interpreted as "It is the bull that Maria has taken by the horns and not the buffalo."
1	The sentence "Maria stende il bucato." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian sentences. In this case, the singular third person present tense verb form "stende" agrees with its singular subject "Maria". Additionally, the definite article "il" preceding "bucato" correctly designates an object that is known or specific to the speaker and listener.
1	The sentence "Il mio cane abbaia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular nouns require singular verbs and plural nouns require plural verbs. In this case, "cane" (dog) is a singular noun, so the verb should be conjugated as "abbaia."
1	The sentence "Riccardo ulula" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and vice versa. Additionally, "ulula" is the third person singular form of the verb "ululare," which means to howl, and it agrees with the singular subject "Riccardo."
1	The sentence "Gabriele dormì" is grammatically correct because it follows the proper conjugation of the Italian verb "dormire" (to sleep) in the past tense for masculine singular subjects like "Gabriele".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("the dog"), an auxiliary verb ("has") that agrees with the third person singular subject, and a past participle form of the main verb ("stopped"). Also, it uses the adverbial expression "in a blink of an eye" correctly to indicate quickly or suddenly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no mistakes in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. "Edoardo" is the subject and the verb "ci ha messo" agrees with it. Additionally, all the other elements of the sentence are well-structured and clear. Good job!
1	The sentence "Leonardo has sectioned the old elm" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Leonardo"), an auxiliary verb ("has") and a past participle ("sectioned") that agrees with the subject, as well as the object of the action ("the old elm"). All the words are used correctly, there are no missing or extra elements, and the meaning of the sentence can be easily understood.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "sono" agrees with its subject "le sei bombe", which is plural. Additionally, the tense and syntax are also appropriate for expressing a past event.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo no longer has the habit of smoking." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. The subject "Lorenzo" is singular, so we use the third-person singular form of the verb "to have," which is "has." Additionally, "the habit of smoking" is correctly constructed as a gerund phrase acting as the direct object of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Andrea is becoming handy" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with its singular or plural subject in number. In this case, the subject "Andrea" is singular and therefore requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "to be," which is "is." Additionally, "handy" can function as an adjective meaning skillful or practical, so the sentence implies that Andrea is developing such skills.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha fatto gli auguri a Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Tommaso"), verb ("ha fatto") and object ("gli auguri"). Additionally, the use of the singular form of the past participle "fatto" agrees with the singular subject "Tommaso".
1	The sentence "Sofia asks that you return immediately." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. Here, the subject of the sentence is "Sofia," which is a singular noun, followed by the verb "asks" in its third-person singular form. Additionally, the subjunctive mood is used correctly to express a request or demand, with the use of the base form of the verb after "that" (in this case, "return"). Overall, there are no apparent errors in this sentence, so I would label it as grammatically correct.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "tu" requires the verb to be in the second person singular form "va", but instead it is written in the third person singular form "và". Additionally, there should be an accent on the word "vai" (or "va") - without one, it changes the meaning of the word entirely. A correct version would be: "Che tu vada via dispiace a Beatrice." or "Che ti vai via dispiace a Beatrice."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "bambini" (children) agrees with the verb "hanno calpestato" (have trampled), and both are plural forms that match correctly. Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no apparent errors in syntax or agreement between words.
0	The verb "erupt" is not used correctly with the subject "bambini". A more appropriate verb would be something like "played", which can take an animated or energetic connotation that might fit better. For example, "I bambini eruttarono giocando." could work as a grammatically correct sentence. However, without additional context it is difficult to provide a precise correction.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
0	The verb "ha" should be replaced with the correct form of past tense "have" to agree with the third person singular subject "quell'uomo". A possible correction could be: "Quell'uomo ne ha fatto una foto." (meaning: That man took one picture.)
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "Andrea". In English, we would say that the subject and verb must "agree," which means they need to match in number (singular or plural). Here, the subject "Andrea" is singular so it requires a third person singular form of the verb, such as "has." Therefore, the corrected version of this sentence should be: "Andrea has caressed Beatrice's face."
1	The sentence "Il volto di Paola è carezzato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, "il volto" (the face) is singular, so the verb must be in its third person singular form ("è"). Additionally, the past participle "carezzato" agrees with the gender and number of the direct object "volto," which is masculine singular.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it implies that Edoardo has fractured multiple arms of Maria, which doesn't make sense. A correct version would be "Edoardo ha fratturato il braccio di Maria." This way, we are indicating that only one arm was fractured by Edoardo.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha paralizzato" does not match with the subject "Leonardo". It should be "ha paralizzato" if referring to only one person (masculine singular). Therefore, it should say "Leonardo ha paralizzato il braccio di Maria." instead of "Leonardo ha paralizzato il braccio a Maria."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "pesava" agrees with its singular subject "il bambino". Additionally, the adverb "pochi" correctly modifies the noun phrase "mesi".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes that the workers paved the road and it uses the past tense form "asfaltarono" which agrees with the subject "gli operai".
1	The sentence "Paola elencò l'invitato" is grammatically correct because the past tense of the Italian verb "elencare" (to list) agrees with the subject "Paola", and the singular direct object pronoun "l'" correctly refers to "l'invitato".
0	In this sentence, there is no need for the past tense "ha messto" to be followed by "ciò", which means "this". Also, "e" should not precede "ciò è accaduto". A grammatically correct version could be: "Alice mise i vestiti nell'armadio ed ecco che successe qualcosa." (Translation: "Alice put the clothes in the wardrobe and look what happened.")
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The use of the past tense "ha tolto" and "è accaduto" indicates that these actions occurred in the past. Additionally, the pronoun "ciò" refers back to the event of taking off clothes and it happening in the closet, which helps maintain clarity throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence "Beatrice fills the fridge with fruit." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement. The subject of the sentence, "Beatrice," agrees with the verb "fills" in number (singular) and person (third). Additionally, the preposition "with" introduces the object of the sentence, "fruit," which correctly describes what Beatrice is filling the fridge with.
1	The sentence "Maria defends Andrea from dangers." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper verb forms for tense consistency (present simple tense).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Even though the subject "il libro" is singular and the recipient and giver are both named Maria, we use the plural form of the verb "passano" because there are two subjects (the book and Maria) that together perform the action of passing. This structure requires the use of a plural verb.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Maria"), verb ("dà") and an indirect object ("Paola") and direct object ("a book"). The verb "dà" agrees with its singular subject "Maria", indicating that she is performing the action described by the verb.
1	The sentence "Francesco delega Gabriele suo representante" is grammatically correct. It means "Francesco appoints Gabriele as his representative". However, it would be more clear if written as "Francesco delega Gabriele come suo rappresentante", but both forms are acceptable and convey the same meaning.
1	The sentence "Sofia delegates Maria as her representative" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for subject-verb agreement and proper use of pronouns.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Lorenzo lives and this happens in Rome."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, or word usage. The sentence has two clauses ("Riccardo ha mangiato la pizza" and "ciò è successo al ristorante") that are both complete thoughts and connected with the conjunction "e". Both verbs agree with their subjects (Riccardo/ha and ciò/è) and are in the past tense. Additionally, all words are used correctly according to standard Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Sofia fuma una bionda" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and uses proper verb conjugations for the third person singular (fuma) with the feminine gender (Sofia). Additionally, "una bionda" correctly refers to one cigarette.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence, "ha spalmato" (third person singular form of the verb "spalmare") indicates the past tense action performed by the subject, while "il paté" and "sul pane" are the direct object and indirect object respectively.
1	The sentence "Andrea ha spalmato il pane di paté." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order and all of the words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects and objects.
1	The sentence "Le bombe piovevano su di noi" is grammatically correct. It uses the third person plural of the imperfect tense ("piovevano") to describe an ongoing action in the past. In this case, the subject "le bombe" (the bombs) requires the use of the plural form.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that mixed marriages (marriages between people of different races, religions or nationalities) work very well. There are no apparent errors in the sentence structure, verb agreement, word choice, and punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of an English question with an auxiliary verb "do" and the base form of the main verb "agree".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La tua idea e la mia sono equivalenti" would also be acceptable and mean the same thing, but "la tua idea e la mia si equivalgono" is more idiomatic and has a slightly different emphasis (it emphasizes that your ideas are currently in the process of being equivalent).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "gira" agrees with its singular subject "Edoardo".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that Julija is traveling from Milan to Naples.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo checks Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses the third person singular form of the verb "to check." Additionally, both proper nouns are capitalized correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, tense usage, word choice, or syntax. The use of the verb "acconsentire" followed by the preposition "a" and an infinitive phrase is also correct in this context.
0	The sentence should be "Alice watches Maria" or "Alice takes care of Maria", as the verb "to watch" or "to take care of" is needed instead of "bada".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular conjugation "dubita" correctly for the subject "Paola".
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "you" should be "do" or "does" followed by the base form of the verb, so it should be "Maria wishes you to leave." instead of "parta".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood (che + verb in its singular form) to express uncertainty or doubt about Juliet being always traveling. In English it would be translated as "That Juliet is always traveling pleases Andrea."
1	The sentence "Emma voluntarily fascinates Francesco." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense and form ("fascinates" agrees with its singular subject "Emma").
1	The sentence "Francesco desires that he comes" is grammatically correct. In this case, the subjunctive mood is used correctly to express desire or demand for an action to be performed. The subject of the second clause, "he," is in the third person singular form, which agrees with its verb "comes." Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement where "il presidente" being singular requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb which is "scriverà". Therefore, there are no errors or issues with this sentence.
0	The verb "partire" should be conjugated to match the subject "Alessandro and Paola," so it should say "ci possiamo partire." Additionally, there is no need for the word "che" before "si parta". A correct version of this sentence could be: "Alessandro invita Paola a partire con lui."
1	The sentence "Alice has accompanied Tommaso to the cinema." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English verb agreement rules and uses proper word order for a simple past tense action with two subjects and one object. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, punctuation is appropriate, and there are no capitalization errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "La partenza" means "the departure," "apporta" is the third person singular form of the verb "apportare" (to bring), which agrees with its subject "la partenza." The phrase "un beneficio a tutti" means "a benefit to all."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Alessandro" is the subject and "si lamenta" is the verb that agrees with it. It means "Alessandro complains." Then we have "del mare sporco," which is the direct object of the verb "lamenta". Finally, there's "con Paola", where "con" is a preposition indicating accompaniment or company, so "Paola" is an indirect object here. Overall, the structure and form are correct.
1	The sentence "Alice mette in agitazione Tommaso" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb form (mette) agrees with its singular subject (Alice). Additionally, the word order and tense are appropriate for this sentence to convey that Alice upsets or disturbs Tommaso.
1	The sentence "Andrea leaves full powers to Leonardo" is grammatically correct. There are no glaring errors that would make the sentence unacceptable in standard Italian. However, it should be noted that this specific phrase could potentially have different interpretations depending on context, as it can imply both an abandonment of responsibilities and a granting of authoritative power.
1	The sentence "Il piatto piange" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for forming sentences in Italian. It has a subject ("il piatto"), and a predicate ("piange"). Additionally, the verb form "piange" agrees with its singular subject in number and person. Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Mi girano le scatole" is an idiomatic expression in Italian that means something like "I am really annoyed."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Alice" is the subject and "si è attaccata" is the verb tense that matches with singular third person (she). It indicates an action performed by the subject on herself. Then, "un capello" is the direct object of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject and the verb "ha piantato" (past tense of "piantare", meaning "to leave stranded") agrees with it. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Sofia and Riccardo talks the same language" is grammatically correct because "talks" agrees with the singular subject "Riccardo". However, it might be more clear to say "Sofia and Riccardo both talk the same language."
0	The sentence "Avere fegato" is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb tense and subject-verb agreement. In order to be grammatically correct, the sentence should include a complete thought with both a subject and predicate. For example, one possible correction could be "Lui ha coraggio," which means "He has courage."
0	The sentence "Avere le paturnies" is grammatically incorrect because it uses the wrong form of the verb "avere." In this context, the correct form should be "ho," as in "Ho le paturnie." The word "paturnie" (which means worries or qualms) already indicates plurality, so there's no need to use a plural form for the verb "avere."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb. It should be "I have boxes" or "There are boxes", for example.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of the preposition "in" used before "a belly of a cow". In this context, we should use the possessive form "a cow's belly", so the corrected version would be "to be in a cow's belly."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of an English phrase and uses appropriate verb conjugations and word forms.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although "possa" and "partire" are singular forms of the verb, they agree with their respective subjects ("Riccardo" and "possibile partenza").
1	The sentence "Beatrice pays attention to Julia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence and uses proper verb tense and agreement between the subject (Beatrice) and the verb (pays).
1	The sentence "Alice is anxious" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Alice") and a verb ("is") that agrees with the subject in number (third person singular). Additionally, "anxious" is used as an adjective to describe Alice's emotional state, which is appropriate in this context.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used according to the subject. In this case, since "we" is plural, the correct form of the verb would be "are". Therefore, the sentence "Siamo cariche di viveri." should instead be "We are well-supplied with food.", which in Italian would be "Siamo ben rifornite di viveri."
1	The sentence "La ragazza mangerà la pizza." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "la ragazza" (the girl) is the subject, which agrees with the third person singular verb form "mangerà" (will eat). Additionally, "la pizza" comes after the verb as required by standard Italian syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "She" is singular and agrees with the verb "has presented". Also, there are no obvious orthographic or syntactic errors.
1	The sentence "Edoardo obbedisce a Sofia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "obbedisce" (obeys) agrees with its singular masculine subject "Edoardo". Additionally, prepositions such as "a" are correctly used to indicate the indirect object of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Edoardo ci va" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian and all of the words are correctly conjugated for the intended meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard subject-verb agreement rules with "Edoardo" as the subject and "andrà" as the verb that agrees with it in number (singular) and person (third).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of three independent clauses connected by the conjunction "and". Each clause has a subject and a verb, following the standard structure of a complete sentence in Italian ("soggetto-verbo"). In this case, we have: (Edoardo va) + (ad invitare) + (Giulia a cena). All elements are correctly declined for number and gender agreement.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject and verb do not agree. "Beatrice" is singular but "le scappa" (which should be "scappa") is in third person plural form. It should be "Lei scappa a comprare."
0	The correct form of the verb "to be" should be used based on the subject. In this case, since the subject is "the books", which is plural, the correct form should be "are". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be: "The books are the ones that Leonardo is putting on the shelves now."
1	The sentence "Edoardo mette i libri sugli scaffali" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "Edoardo" (the subject) agrees with the third person singular present tense form of the verb "mettere," which is "mette." Additionally, the plural nouns "libri" and "scaffali" are properly marked for their respective number and gender.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject "libri" which is plural. Therefore, it should be "sono" instead of "è". Also, there is no need for a relative pronoun such as "che" after "sugli scaffali", so the sentence "Sono i libri il suo interesse adesso?" would also not be grammatically correct. A possible correction could be "È mettere i libri sugli scaffali quello che Leonardo sta facendo adesso?" (Is putting books on shelves what Leo is doing now?)
1	The sentence "Andrea mangia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "mangia" (which means "eats") agrees with its singular subject "Andrea".
1	The sentence "This work is Leo's responsibility." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject "this work" is singular and agrees with its verb "is". Also, possessive form "Leo's" correctly shows ownership of the responsibility.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "This job falls within Ricky's skills" is a complete and coherent statement without any grammar or usage errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. All of the verb conjugations and word choices fit within standard Italian usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense. "Andrea" (singular subject) is paired with "accarezza" (third person singular present tense of the Italian verb "accarezzare," meaning "to caress"), which agrees both in number and tense. Similarly, "le gambe" (plural object) matches the plural form of the pronoun "di." Overall, the structure and word choice are consistent with formal written or spoken Italian.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non gradì quell'allusione." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, there are no errors related to word forms or their order within the sentence. Additionally, the verb "gradì" agrees with its subject "Riccardo," which is singular. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Francesco ricorda qualcosa." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "Francesco" serves as the subject, while "ricorda" functions as the third-person singular indicative present tense form of the verb "ricordare," meaning "to remember." Additionally, "qualcosa" acts as an indefinite pronoun signifying "something." As such, this arrangement creates a complete and proper Italian sentence that conveys a coherent thought.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although it may seem long and complex at first glance, the structure of the sentence is logically sound. "Era" refers to the past tense of "essere", which agrees with its subject "la conversazione". Then we have two relative clauses "che fecero i due ragazzi" and "che Paola criticò". Both are introduced by the relative pronouns "che" that refer back to their respective antecedents "conversazione" and "la (conversazione)". Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Leggeva i nomi degli artisti alla ragazza." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He was reading the names of artists to the girl."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses appropriate verb tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "She was happy about it" is a complete and proper English sentence with the subject-verb agreement (she-was) being correct as well as the tense used here which is past tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "he" agrees with the verb "was." Additionally, the past tense of the verb "to play" should be used after "was," which is "played," but it does not affect the overall grammaticality of the sentence since "play" can also be used as the past tense of "to play."
1	The sentence "Alessandro disgusta Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Alessandro") and a verb ("disgusta"). The form of the verb agrees with the masculine singular subject "Alessandro".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Ne" is a common Italian contraction of "di" and "ne", which means "of them". So the sentence translates to "We see some of them."
1	The sentence "Ha abboccato all'amo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian and does not contain any orthographic or syntactic errors.
0	The sentence should be "I have laughed for two hours" or "I was laughing for two hours", because the simple past tense of "laugh" is not "risi", but rather "laughed". Additionally, it should specify whether you were continuously laughing for two hours straight or if you had been laughing on and off for that duration.
1	The sentence "Ha preso una cotta per Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, "ha" (the third person singular form of the verb "avere," meaning "to have") agrees with the singular subject "lui" or "lei" which is implied but not mentioned explicitly in the sentence. Additionally, the object of the sentence "una cotta" (meaning "a crush") is correctly used as a feminine noun that requires an article before it.
1	The sentence "Maria is in crisis." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Maria") and a verb ("is") that agrees in number (third person singular) with the subject. Additionally, the preposition "in" followed by the noun "crisis" correctly describes the state or condition of the subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense. "Conservava" (past tense of conservare) agrees with its singular subject "he", "she", or "it". In this case, we are assuming that the subject is not plural because no other information was provided.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "has" agrees with its singular subject "Maria". Additionally, the past tense form "venduto" correctly indicates that the action of selling took place in the past and matches the plural object "i suoi vestiti."
1	The sentence "Paola ha confrontato i due libri in biblioteca." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here are some reasons why this sentence is acceptable: - The subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "ha confrontato," which is in the third person singular form (-a ending). - The use of article "i" before "due libri" indicates that we are referring to specific books (masculine plural noun), not just any two books. - The preposition "in" followed by "biblioteca" correctly expresses the location where the action took place. Overall, the sentence has a clear meaning and uses proper word order, making it grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "ha immerso" and the object "il figlio" follows the verb correctly. Also, the prepositional phrase "nell'acqua fredda" provides more information about where the action took place.
1	The sentence "Leonardo leggeva sul divano." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the past tense (imperfetto). Here, "leggeva" is the imperfect form of the verb "leggere" (to read), which agrees with the subject "Leonardo". Additionally, "sul divano" correctly uses the preposition "su" to indicate that he was reading on the sofa.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "consensus" agrees with the verb "has been born," and "of the people" functions as an adjectival phrase modifying "consensus."
1	The sentence "Francesco guarda che tutto proceda per il meglio." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "guarda" is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "guardare," which agrees with its subject "Francesco." Additionally, the subjunctive mood is used correctly to express doubt or uncertainty about whether everything will go well, as indicated by the phrase "che tutto proceda per il meglstro." Overall, this sentence demonstrates good command of Italian grammar and usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "sia" is used as a subjunctive form of the verb "essere". It indicates a hypothetical or uncertain situation. In this context, it translates to something like "Francesco is ashamed that it happened."
1	The sentence "Giulia must work tomorrow." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, the singular third-person subject "Giulia" matches with the singular third-person verb form "must work". Additionally, the tense of the verb indicates future action, which is appropriate for referring to an event that will happen on the following day.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "stabilì" does not agree with its subject "Francesco". Since "Francesco" is singular and masculine, the correct form of the verb should be "stabilì", but instead, it appears as if it agrees with the plural noun phrase "la partenza di Tommaso con Maria," which makes no sense in this context. A possible correction could be: "Francesco stabilì che Tommaso partisse con Maria."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "to have" (ha) agrees with its plural subject "Maria".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "gli" is used as an indirect object pronoun to indicate the person who receives the rent money (in English, it would be translated to "to him").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English, we use the auxiliary verb "have" to form questions and negations with plural nouns or pronouns such as "they." Therefore, "hanno" (which means "have" in Italian) is used correctly in this question.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used according to the subject; in this case, it should be "he" or "she", not "gli". A grammatically correct version could be: "This makes him/her angry very quickly."
1	The sentence "Per tutta la vita ha costruito castelli in aria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. In this case, the subject "ha" agrees with the singular noun "la vita," and the past tense indicates that the action was completed in the past. Additionally, the phrase "castelli in aria" is an idiomatic expression meaning to daydream or make plans without any foundation in reality.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "that land yields much money" could be an equivalent translation. Please note that the verb "to fruit" is not commonly used in modern English and might sound strange to native speakers.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha fatto scrivere una lettera a Lorenzo da Riccardo." is grammatically correct. In this Italian sentence, the verb "fare" (which means "to make") requires that its direct object be in the accusative case and preceded by the preposition "a". Here, the direct object is "una lettera", which follows these rules, so the sentence is grammatically correct.
0	The verb "fare" should be conjugated as "ha fatto", but it is not the case here. Also, there must be an object between "rompere" and "da". A possible correction could be: "Il vento ha fatto infrangere il vetro da parte di Andrea."
0	The correct phrase should be "The colonel commanded the ship" or "The colonel made the ship", as the verb "fare" (to make) is not appropriate in this context when referring to a boat or ship.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo si è fatto rompere la vetrata." is grammatically correct. It consists of the subject "Lorenzo" who performed the reflexive action "si è fatto", which means "had it done to himself". Then we have the past participle "rompere" and the direct object "la vetrata". Everything follows Italian grammar rules correctly.
1	The sentence "Il sasso ha rotto il vetro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require a singular verb and plural subjects require a plural verb. In this case, "sasso" (stone) is singular and requires the use of "ha" instead of "hanno". Additionally, the past participle "rotto" agrees with the gender and number of the direct object "il vetro", which is masculine singular. Therefore, the sentence structure and usage are all accurate according to Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the auto" (singular) agrees with the verb "ha schiacciato" (also singular). Additionally, the article "l'" before accelerator correctly matches its gender and number.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "the accelerator" refers to the gas pedal of a vehicle, which can be pressed or depressed by a forceful blow (in this context, "colpo"). Therefore, it makes sense that the subject has "hit" or "struck" the accelerator, causing the car to speed up.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo has broken off the engagement." is grammatically correct. It follows standard English verb agreement rules where the third person singular subject (Lorenzo) takes a verb with an -s or -es ending. Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are appropriately used and formed correctly to convey its intended meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular form of the verb "avere" (ha) to agree with the subject "il caldo", which is also singular.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "ha" agrees with the singular subject "l'umidità", and "ossidato" correctly describes the action taken by the subject on the object "il ferro".
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha fatto ossidare il ferro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of Italian sentences. Here, "ha fatto" (third person singular form of the verb "fare") agrees with the subject "Gabriele," while "ossidare" is used as an auxiliary verb to indicate that the action has been completed. Therefore, there are no errors or inconsistencies in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible minor improvement could be to replace "of" with "from", making it read: "The glass was broken from the explosion of a shot." However, this does not make the original sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence "Maria did not remember to bring an umbrella." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for forming negative sentences with auxiliary verbs (in this case, "did"). Additionally, all of the words are used correctly and there are no obvious errors in subject-verb agreement or tense usage.
1	The sentence "Paola has neglected herself" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Paola"), auxiliary verb ("has") and past participle form of the main verb ("neglected"). Also, the pronoun used for reflexive verbs such as neglect is correctly used (herself).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no need for any changes. A literal translation of the sentence would be "The man washed yesterday is my grandfather." However, English speakers tend to use different constructions with the past tense (e.g., "The man who was washing dishes yesterday turned out to be my grandfather"), so this may sound unusual or incorrect to some native English speakers even though it follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Andrea has scratched the car door" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense (present perfect) to indicate that the action was completed at an unspecified time in the past. Additionally, all of the words are correctly used and spelled, making this a complete and coherent sentence.
1	The sentence "Lo sportello dell'auto si è graffiato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. Here, we have the reflexive verb "si è graffiato," which agrees with its singular subject "lo sportello." Additionally, the article "l'" before "auto" correctly matches the gender and number of the noun. Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Il viso di Tommaso si è graffiato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In this case, we have the reflexive verb "si è graffiato", which agrees with its singular subject "il viso". Additionally, the article "il" before "viso" matches the gender and number agreement. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "I prati si sono rivestiti con i fiori." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar for verb conjugations and word usage. In this case, the past participle "si sono rivestiti" agrees with its subject "i prati," which is plural. Additionally, the preposition "con" is used correctly to indicate that the flowers are on top of or covering the meadows.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "The prices have increased by 10%" is an alternative way to express the same idea correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. "Il" refers to a singular noun, so the third person singular form of the verb "essere" (si è) should be used after it, which is what occurs in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the subject-verb agreement or any other aspect of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible interpretation of the sentence could be that "the design" (which refers to a plan or drawing) was compared with "the photo".
1	The sentence "Il contagio sta si propagando" is grammatically correct. However, it can be improved for clarity and simplicity by removing the unnecessary word "si". A better way to say it would be "Il contagio sta propagandosi", which means "The contagion is spreading".
0	The verb "impelare" does not exist in the Italian language. It seems that there was a typo or confusion with another word like "impigliare", which means to snag or tangle. However, since the intended meaning is not clear from the provided sentence and the verb form looks incorrect as well (it should be something like "hanno impiastricciato i peli sul divano"), I cannot definitively say what the correct version of this sentence would look like without additional context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("the winter"), verb ("has deprived") and object ("leaves from the trees"). Additionally, the use of the third person singular present tense "has" agrees with the plural noun "winter."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although "per un secondo" can be translated as "for a second", it might not convey the intended meaning of a brief moment. It would be more natural to say "The explosion shattered the window for an instant".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "to split" is used correctly with the subject "la vetrata". Additionally, the word "un" before "millisecondo" agrees in number and gender with "millisecondo", as it should.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an action (the plaster crumbled) completed by the subject (the plaster) in the past few weeks using the third person singular form of the verb "to crumble" ("si è sgretolato").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "ha" agrees with the singular subject "la pioggia", and it is correctly conjugated in the present perfect tense. Additionally, the word order of the sentence is also correct, making this phrase acceptable.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha riempito il serbatoio per un'ora." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for past tense. Here, "ha" is an auxiliary verb that must be used with the subject "Francesco," which is in masculine singular form; "riempito" correctly agrees with both the subject and its direct object ("il serbatoio"). Additionally, prepositional phrases like "per un'ora" usually come after the main clause in Italian sentences.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense. "Il prezzo" (the subject) agrees with "si è abbassato" (the verb), as both are singular and past participle. Additionally, the time frame for the discount ("per sei mesi") is clearly stated at the end of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of "protract" (which means to prolong or extend) is used correctly as "ha protratto". Additionally, the subject "he/she/it" before the verb implies that we need to use the third person singular form of the verb, which matches with the one used ("ha").
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha proseguito la lezione per ore" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. In this case, the subject (Gabriele) agrees with the singular form of the verb (ha proseguito), indicating that there is only one person involved. Additionally, the adverb "per ore" correctly modifies the verb to indicate for how long the action has been performed.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although "carburate" is not an English word, the incorrect form of the verb does not affect the overall structure and meaning of the sentence. In context, it appears that this could be a typographical error or a term used within a specific community (e.g., sports).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "ha" agrees with its subject "il lievito," which is singular, and "in due ore" correctly describes when the action was completed.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is an agreement between the subject "il temporale" and the verb "ha ritardato". Also, the adverbial expression "in two hours" correctly modifies the meaning of the verb by specifying for how long the action has been performed.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "ha" agrees with its subject "l'incidente", which is singular and in third person. Also, "ritardato" matches with "il treno" as past participle. Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Il treno ha ritardato per due ore." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense.
1	The sentence "Il vino è diventato aceto per ore." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere," which agrees with its subject "il vino." Additionally, the preposition "per" followed by the duration "ore" (hours) correctly indicates how long the transformation took place.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the plural form "have" is used correctly with multiple subjects ("traders"). Also, there are no obvious orthographic or syntactic errors that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "are" agrees with its plural subject "sales". Also, the past participle "incremented" correctly follows the auxiliary verb "are", and it is appropriately modified by the percentage increase shown in numerals ("10%"). Additionally, there are two time intervals specified as "two years," which shows that sales increased over this period of time. Overall, the sentence is clear, concise, and proper English usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate verb tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "has melted" agrees with the subject "the chocolate," and "in five minutes" correctly describes when the action took place.
1	The sentence "La carne si è cotta in 5 minuti" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian verb conjugation for the passive voice of the verb "cuocere" (to cook) and agrees with the singular subject "la carne". Additionally, the adverb "in cinque minuti" correctly indicates the duration of time required to cook the meat.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past simple tense "si chiuse" to indicate that the action of closing the window happened in the past and it uses the present tense "non è chusa" to describe the current state of the window.
1	The sentence "La valigia è diventata leggera" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian where singular subjects require a singular verb and plural subjects require a plural verb. In this case, the singular noun "valigia" corresponds with the singular form of the verb "è". Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and there is no missing punctuation or other errors that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the plural form "sono" should be used because it refers to "prezzi", which is already in its plural form. However, using "sono" instead of "è" would not make the sentence incorrect as it still maintains subject-verb agreement and conveys the intended meaning accurately.
0	The verb "hanno" does not agree with its subject "they". The correct form should be "They have made the room large." or "They've made the room big.", depending on informality and context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate form of the verb "fare" (si è fatto) to agree with its singular subject "il mare".
1	The sentence "The meat is flavorful." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree in number with the subject. In this case, "meat" is singular and requires the singular form of the verb "to be," which is "is." Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are grammatically correct as well.
0	The verb "is" should agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, the subject "I phone" is incorrect because it uses the possessive form instead of the plural noun "iPhones". Additionally, personal pronouns like "I" are always capitalized. Therefore, the correct sentence would be "iPhones are the best."
1	The sentence "Il pullover di lana si è infeltrito" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language. Here, we have the singular verb form "si è" that agrees with its subject "il pullover", which is also singular. Additionally, the past participle "infeltrito" correctly matches with the gender and number of the noun it refers to - "pullover". Therefore, this sentence is perfectly acceptable in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "Edoardo" as a singular noun takes the third person singular form of the verb "has become," which is "si è fatto."
1	The sentence "La carne è diventata gustosa" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and agree with each other in terms of number and gender. Additionally, the verb "è diventata" agrees with its subject "la carne."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no obvious errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. However, the meaning might be more clear if "ingarbugliata" was replaced with a synonym that could help clarify what specifically has become complicated (e.g., confusa, intricata).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "L'aria" which means air is feminine singular and the verb "si è fatta" agrees with it correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The word "ingarbugliatissima" is the superlative form of the adjective "ingarbugliato", which means tangled or complicated. In this case, it correctly describes the situation as being extremely complex.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "hanno" agrees with its subject "argomenti," which is plural. Also, it is appropriate to use an object pronoun ("lo") before a noun when referring back to that noun in the same sentence, as done here with "Riccardo."
1	The sentence "La follia spaventa Francesco" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and the sentence follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Le ragazze hanno innervosito Andrea." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere," which agrees with the subject "le ragazze," meaning "the girls." Additionally, "innervosire" is a transitive verb that takes an object (in this case, "Andrea"), so its usage here is appropriate as well.
0	The correct form should be "Francesco was worried by the girls" instead of "Le ragazze hanno preoccupato Francesco". In English and Italian, we need to use the passive voice when talking about someone being worried or concerned.
1	The sentence "Quei fuochi hanno innervosito Edoardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "quei fuochi" (those fires) is the subject, "hanno innervosito" (have annoyed) is the verb phrase, and "Edoardo" is the direct object. This structure correctly conveys that multiple fires caused Edward to become agitated or upset.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "Alice". Also, there are two direct objects ("Andrea" and "quell'uomo") which makes it confusing to understand who exactly was made calm by Alice. It would be better if the sentence were rephrased for clarity.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word order and verb agreement. A correct version could be "Maria has made Gabriele worry about his girlfriend."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "Maria". It should be "María hizo enredar a Leonardo." (in Spanish) or "Maria made Leo get entangled." (in English).
0	The verb "sedurre" requires an object to complete its meaning. In this sentence, there is no direct or indirect object of the action, making it grammatically incorrect. A possible correction could be: "Riccardo si sta seducendo (to himself)" or "Riccardo si sta facendo sedurre (by someone)".
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "Lorenzo" should be "ha", not "è". Also, the preposition "per" is incorrectly used here and it should be replaced with "di". So, the grammatically correct sentence would be: "A Lorenzo è piaciuto ciò di lui."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "si è spaventato", which shows that the action was done by only one person (singular). Also, the past participle "spaventato" must agree with the gender and number of the subject, so we use the masculine singular form because "Edoardo" is a male name in its singular form.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è agitato a quella notizia" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "si è agitato" is the third person singular verb form that agrees with its subject "Riccardo." Additionally, the clause "a quella notizia" comes after the predicate, which is common in Italian sentences to express the reason or cause for an action.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ssi agitated for that news." is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, tense, word choice or syntax. However, I would suggest changing "that" to "this" since the news was presumably recently received by Tommaso and is still relevant. Therefore, the corrected sentence should be: "Tommaso has agitated for this news."
1	The sentence "Riccardo è irritated of that news." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "è", and "that news" is correctly used as the object of the preposition "of". Additionally, "irritated" is an adjective that describes the emotional state of the subject, so it is appropriately used here.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is nothing wrong with the verb conjugations or word choices. The subject "il fatto" agrees with the singular verb "abbasserà", and the phrase "illude i cittadini" correctly uses the third person plural indirect object pronoun "i".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria has fear of that" is a correct way to say it in English, although the more common phrasing would be "Maria is afraid of that".
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject it agrees with. In this case, "fa" is the third person singular form and should agree with the subject "ciò", but "ciò" requires the third person plural form "fanno". Therefore, the sentence is not grammatically correct. A corrected version would be: "Ciò li fa terrorizzare, a Maria."
1	The sentence "Emma si sente nervosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person subject (Emma) takes the verb form of "si sente". The adjective "nervosa" also agrees with the gender and number of the noun "Emma."
1	The sentence "Sofia is worried about what happened." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "Sofia". Additionally, the preposition "about" introduces the clause that describes what Sofia is worried about, and the past participle "what happened" serves as the object of the preposition. Overall, this sentence has proper structure and word usage, making it grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Sofia has nerves of steel" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement between the subject (Sofia) and the verb (has).
1	The sentence "Emma is amazed" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence where the subject ("Emma") is followed by the verb ("is") and then the object or complement ("amazed"). In this case, the verb agrees with the singular subject "Emma," so there are no grammatical errors.
1	The sentence "Paola is in a state of fright" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for forming an English sentence (Subject + Verb + Object) and all the words are correctly used with respect to their tense, form and meaning. Specifically, the subject "Paola" agrees with the third-person singular present tense verb "is", and the phrase "in a state of fright" correctly describes her emotional condition.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The word "those" refers to specific words previously mentioned and serves as the subject of the sentence, agreeing with the verb "have."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "appassionano" agrees with the plural subject "I film". Therefore, it is grammatically correct to use "appassionano" instead of "appassiona".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause "l'esplosione ha frantumato" and a subordinate clause "il vetro", both linked by the conjunction "il". This structure follows Italian syntax rules correctly.
1	The sentence "Quella pietanza ha nauseato Francesco." is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are correctly used and agree with each other. In this case, the past participle "nauseata" agrees with the gender (feminine) and number (singular) of the subject "quella pietanza". Additionally, the verb "ha nauseato" shows that the subject is singular, which matches the subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be no changes made to it. It follows standard English syntax and has a clear subject ("the state of health of my mother") and verb ("has worried"). Additionally, the word "me" is correctly used as an indirect object.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "ha" agrees with its subject "lo stato", and the phrase "in pochi minuti" modifies the verb "mi ha addolorato".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. There are no errors or issues with verb agreement, word usage, or syntax that would make it incorrect.
1	The sentence "Beatrice has irritated Francesco." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Beatrice"), auxiliary verb ("has") and past participle form of the main verb ("irritated"). Also, the names are used appropriately as subjects and objects in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il tuo arrivo" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "ha agitato". Also, "Gabriele" correctly follows the verb in its singular form as the indirect object of the sentence.
1	The sentence "La reputazione di Emma si è distrutta con quello scandalo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. Here, "si è distrutta" agrees with its singular feminine subject "la reputazione di Emma".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the use of verb tense or subject-verb agreement, and all words are spelled correctly. The sentence "L'intonaco si è sgretolato" translates to "The stucco has crumbled" in English.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, or word choice. The sentence expresses a complete thought and all required components of grammar (article, noun, adjective, etc.) are present and used correctly.
1	The sentence "Giulia ha spento le polemiche" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require a singular verb and plural subjects require a plural verb. In this case, the singular third person feminine form of the verb "spento" agrees with the singular female subject "Giulia". Additionally, the phrase "le polemiche" (the controversies) correctly takes on the plural form as it serves as the direct object in this sentence.
1	The sentence "La schiena si è scottata" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for past tense sentences in Italian. In this case, "si è scottata" is the third person singular reflexive form of the verb "scottarsi," which means to get sunburned or burnt. Since "schiena" (back) is feminine and singular, using the third person singular form agrees with the subject.
0	The verb "essere" should be in the third person singular form "è", not the second person plural form "siete". Additionally, there is no clear subject for the sentence and it lacks proper context to make complete sense. A possible grammatically correct version could be: "Gabriele è stanco di trattare con Maria." (Gabriele is tired of dealing with Maria.)
1	The sentence "Riccardo is eager to leave" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are used correctly and contribute to the overall coherence of meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an action (Giulia moving a body) and the location of that action (from the closet to the table). All words are used correctly, there are no missing or extra components, and verb tense is consistent with the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "Francesco va a scuola." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. "Francesco" is the subject and "va" is the verb that agrees with the singular third person subject. Additionally, "a scuola" correctly uses the preposition "a" before the destination of movement.
1	The sentence "Gabriele is at the Swiss school." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and uses proper punctuation.
1	The sentence "Gabriele is at the table." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. The subject "Gabriele" is singular and requires the third-person singular form of the verb "to be," which is "is." Additionally, the preposition "at" is correctly used to indicate location or position.
1	The sentence "Beatrice porta un piatto in tavola." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and syntax.
1	The sentence "Giulia accompanies Gabriele in tavola" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, "accompagnare" takes on the third person singular form ("accompagna") since the subject (Giulia) is a single female entity. Additionally, there are no apparent word order issues or incorrect verb tense usage.
1	The sentence "Maria falls to the ground" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense. The verb "falls" agrees with its singular subject "Maria," indicating that she is performing the action of falling. Additionally, the preposition "to" is used correctly before the noun phrase "the ground." Overall, this sentence presents no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings.
1	The sentence "Andrea has enrolled his son in dance school" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement.
1	The sentence "Emma ha portato il paco a scuola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses appropriate Italian vocabulary and syntax.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject "Francesco" is singular and third-person, so the correct form of the verb to be is "sta". Therefore, the sentence "Francesco sta in poltrona" is grammatically incorrect, it should be "Francesco está en la silla reclinable" or its English equivalent "Francesco is sitting on the armchair."
0	The correct form of the verb "è" should be used instead of "finita". A grammatically correct sentence could be: "La palla è finita dietro."
1	The sentence "La palla è finita in acqua." is grammatically correct because all the words are correctly conjugated and used in their proper form according to Italian grammar rules. Specifically, "la" (feminine singular definite article), "palla" (feminine singular noun for ball), "è" (third person singular indicative of verb "essere", meaning "to be"), "finita" (participio passato of verb "finire", meaning "to finish" or "end up") and "in" (preposition indicating location) followed by "acqua" (noun for water).
1	The sentence "Maria lives down below" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax and verb conjugation rules for present tense third-person singular subjects (Maria).
1	The sentence "Mi raccomando, tieni acqua in boca." is grammatically correct. However, it should be noted that the phrase "tenere qualcosa in bocca" generally means to keep something inside your mouth (for example, when you are trying not to speak about a secret), so the literal translation of this sentence into English might sound strange or confusing. A more natural way to say "Be careful" or "Watch out" in Italian would be "Stai attento".
1	The sentence "Il bambino sta piangendo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugation for third person singular present tense ("sta" from the verb "stare") and past participle agreement with the auxiliary verb ("piangendo").
1	The sentence "Lorenzo perdì il cappello" is grammatically correct because the past tense of the verb "perdere" (to lose) agrees with the subject "Lorenzo". In Italian, the past tense of verbs changes depending on the gender and number of the subject, but in this case, the masculine singular form ("perdì") was used correctly.
1	The sentence "Riccardo avrebbe bruciato le tapes" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugation for the conditional tense (avrebbe + bruciato) and the noun-adjective agreement for gender and number (le tapes). Therefore, this sentence can be labeled as 1, meaning that it is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Maria ha rubato improvvisamente il cuore a Gabriele" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject "Maria" is the one performing the action of stealing, which is expressed by the verb "ha rubato". The word "improvvisamente" modifies how the action was performed, and it agrees with the verb tense used. Lastly, "il cuore" refers to what was stolen, while "Gabriele" indicates who the object of affection is. Therefore, all elements are correctly conjugated and placed within the sentence structure.
1	The sentence "Emma se la passava bene" is grammatically correct. Here, the reflexive pronoun "la" refers to "Emma," and it indicates that she was having a good time by herself or taking care of something related to her without external help.
1	The sentence "Giulia mise gli occhi addosso a Lorenzo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, we have the subject "Giulia" followed by the verb "mise" (the past tense form of mettere) which agrees with the gender and number of the subject. Then, there is the prepositional phrase "addosso a Lorenzo", where "addosso" functions as an adverb indicating the manner in which Giulia looked at Lorenzo, while "a Lorenzo" indicates the indirect object of the action. Overall, this sentence is well-formed and acceptable in standard Italian.
1	The sentence "Riccardo abbandonò l'abito sul divano." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word order. The subject "Riccardo" is followed by the verb "abbandonò" in its simple past form, which agrees with the subject in number and gender. The direct object "l'abito" comes before the indirect object "sul divano", following the typical SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure found in many romance languages like Italian. Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated for tense, number, and gender.
1	The sentence "Maria inclined her head." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense for past action with third person singular subject (Maria). Additionally, the verb "inclined" agrees with its singular subject "head".
1	The sentence "Alice piegò la testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and verb conjugation. Here, "piegò" is the past tense form of the verb "piangere" (to bend) which agrees with the subject "Alice". Additionally, the article "la" correctly precedes the noun "testa", indicating that the gender of the noun is feminine singular.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the auxiliary verb "levò" agrees with the subject "Maria", which is singular and feminine. Additionally, the past tense of the verb corresponds to the time frame of the action described.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of "rizzare" (to lift or raise) is "rizzo", and it agrees with the subject "Maria". Moreover, the direct object "il capo" is correctly gendered and numbered.
1	The sentence "Gabriele prese l'auto." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "prese" is the third person singular (singular subject "Gabriele") imperfect indicative form of the verb "prendere," which means "to take". Additionally, "l'auto" is correctly used as the direct object with an article preceding it to indicate definite reference.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible interpretation of the sentence could be that "Alessandro took (or grabbed) the thrombosis". However, this seems medically unlikely and strange; perhaps what was meant to be conveyed is more likely related to taking care or treating an instance of deep vein thrombosis?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La trombosi venne ad Edoardo" is a complete and proper Italian sentence where the past tense of the verb "venire" (to come) agrees with its subject "la trombosis."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Venne" is the past tense of the verb "venire," which means to come. In this case, it indicates that Riccardo came at some point in the past.
1	The sentence "Leonardo si scaldò" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard pattern for forming the simple past tense of reflexive verbs in Italian. In this case, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun and "scaldò" is the simple past tense form of the verb "riscaldarsi."
1	The sentence "Maria si riposò" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the past tense for the verb "riposarsi". In this case, "si riposò" indicates that Maria rested by herself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate form of the past tense of the verb "rinforzare" which is "si rinforzò". In this case, the use of "si" as a reflexive pronoun is also appropriate to indicate that Alice was strengthening herself.
1	The sentence "Paola and Francesco took off" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an action performed by two or more people using the past tense of the verb "to take," which is "took." Both names are connected with the conjunction "and" to indicate that both individuals were involved in performing the same action together at the same time.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ebbe una sbornia." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "ebbe" is the simple past tense (passato remoto) form of the verb "avere," which means "to have," used with the subject "Riccardo." Additionally, "una sbornia" refers to a hangover or drunkenness, making the overall meaning clear and coherent.
1	The sentence "Il formaggio fece la muffa" is grammatically correct because the past tense of the verb "fare" (to make) agrees with the subject "il formaggio". Additionally, the phrase "fece la muffa" correctly indicates that mold grew on the cheese.
1	The sentence "Sofia ebbe un bagno." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "ebbe" is the past tense form of the auxiliary verb "avere," which means "to have," and agrees with the subject "Sofia." Additionally, the article "un" preceding "bagno" correctly indicates that the noun is masculine singular. Therefore, this sentence can be interpreted as "Sofia had a bath."
1	The sentence "Beatrice si maritò con Gabriele." is grammatically correct because it uses the correct past tense of the verb "maritarsi" and follows subject-verb agreement rules for Italian verbs.
1	The sentence "Riccardo respirò aria fresca" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all of the words are correctly conjugated for the past tense. In this case, "Riccardo" is the subject, "respirò" (the past tense form of "respiro") is the verb, and "aria fresca" is the object.
1	The sentence "Giulia prese una dritta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. In this case, "prese", which means "took," agrees with its singular feminine subject "Giula." Additionally, "una dritta" (meaning "a tip") correctly uses an article before the noun as required by Italian grammar.
1	The sentence "Giulia si sbagliò" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the past tense of the verb "sbagliare". In this case, since the subject "Giulia" is feminine singular, the past tense should end in "-ò", which it does. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
0	The correct form of the verb to use with "l'aereo" (singular) is "approda" instead of "approdarono" which is used for plural nouns. Also, in this context it should be "è atterrato" because an airplane cannot "approdare", that verb is usually reserved for boats and ships arriving on land.
1	The sentence "Alessandro si bagnò" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, the subject "Alessandro" is singular and masculine, and the verb "si bagnò" agrees with it in number and gender. Additionally, the adverb "si" indicates that Alessandro performed the action on himself, making the sentence clear and coherent.
1	The sentence "Tommaso arieggió la sua stanza." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "Tommaso" is the subject and "ariegió" (the third conjugation of the verb "arieggiare") agrees with it as a singular masculine noun. Additionally, "la sua stanza" serves as the direct object, following standard SOV structure for transitive verbs like "ariegaiare".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "ammarò" (which means "ran aground" or "made an emergency water landing") agrees with the singular subject "la nave".
1	The sentence "Tommaso prese la terra dal secchio" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word usage. Here are some reasons why this sentence is acceptable: - The subject of the sentence, "Tommaso," agrees with the verb "prese" (third person singular). - The direct object "la terra" comes before the indirect object "dal secchio." This order is common in Italian sentences to emphasize the importance of the direct object. - The article "la" precedes "terra" as expected for feminine nouns. - The phrase "dal secchio" uses the preposition "da" followed by the masculine singular definite article "il" contracted into "dal" which means "from the bucket." Overall, there are no errors or inconsistencies that would make this sentence unacceptable in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the third person plural form of the verb "to voyage" which agrees with its subject "marinai". In English, this translation would be "The sailors were rowing."
1	The sentence "The dollar rose." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("the dollar") and a verb ("rose") in past tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "have" (ebbe) agrees with the subject "il progetto", and it is correctly conjugated. Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo prese un cappellaccio." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian independent clause and uses proper verb conjugations. "Prese" is the third person singular (he) past tense form of the verb "prendere," which means "to take," while "un cappellaccio" is a masculine singular noun phrase that functions as the direct object of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si imbronciò" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian conjugation for the third person singular of the verb "imbronciarsi" (to frown) in the simple past tense ("passato remoto"). In this case, the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the ending "-ò".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Andrea took his hat" would also be acceptable and convey the same meaning. However, the original sentence is not incorrect because it could imply that Andrea picked up someone else's hat or simply the act of picking up a (generic) hat without specifying ownership.
0	The correct form should be "Paola took (or picked) up her body" instead of "prese corpo". It is not clear what the intended meaning was, but it seems that there might have been a confusion with verb conjugations or word choices.
1	The sentence "Alessandro prende parte alla festa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian verb conjugation for the third person singular (Alessandro) in the present tense (prende). The subject-verb agreement is also consistent as the singular subject "Alessandro" matches with the singular verb "prende".
1	The sentence "Francesco annotò la lezione." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb conjugation for the singular masculine noun "Francesco" with the past tense of the verb "annotare".
1	The sentence "Leonardo prende imbarco sulla nave" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb takes its singular form ("prende") when referring to a singular masculine subject ("Leonardo"). Additionally, the phrase "imbarco sulla nava" is an appropriate way to say "boarding on the ship," making this sentence completely acceptable and idiomatic in Italian.
1	The sentence "Paola prese informazioni su Alessandro." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word usage. Here, "prese" is the past tense third-person singular form of the verb "prendere," which agrees with the subject "Paola". Also, "informazioni" is used correctly as a plural noun that takes on masculine gender when referring to general information or knowledge. Overall, this sentence has no grammar mistakes and conveys a clear meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the past tense and uses proper verb conjugations for both subjects "Edoardo" and "Sofia".
0	The verb "prendere" should be conjugated as "prende" because the subject "Paola" is singular and feminine. Additionally, "odio" is a noun that needs an article before it, so it should be "un odio." Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Paola prese un odio a Tommaso."
0	The verb "imbeccarsi" should agree with the subject "gli uccelli," which is plural. Therefore, it should be "si sono imbeccati" instead of "si imbeccano." The corrected sentence is "Gli uccelli si sono imbeccati dalla madre."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the past tense and uses proper verb conjugations for regular verbs ("prese" from "prendere") and irregular verbs ("per" from "avere"). Additionally, it follows standard Italian syntax rules with subject-verb-object word order (Maria took a crush on Francesco).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Maria" (being the subject) takes or gets something (the game of Lorenzo), so we use "took" or "got" as the past tense of "takes". Since it's clear that Maria performed the action on the object and not vice versa, using "took" instead of "got" makes more sense here. Therefore, the sentence "Maria si prese il gioco di Lorenzo." can be translated to "Maria took Lorenzo's game for herself."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo is the first one in the race" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo") and predicate ("is the first one in the race"). Additionally, the verb tense used (present simple) is appropriate for describing general facts or states of being, as in this case.
1	The sentence "Francesco prese il coltello per la lama." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word order. Here we have a simple past tense verb "prese" (took) that agrees with its subject "Francesco". Then there are two objects - "il coltello" (the knife), which comes before the second object "per la lama" (by the blade). This structure allows for clarity about what was taken by whom and why or how.
1	The sentence "Leonardo fece il proprio danno" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations for the subject "Leonardo."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo has taken flies for flasks" is grammatically correct but semantically odd because the idiomatic expression "take fishes for flasks" (Italian equivalent of "prendere pere per ciliegie", meaning to mistake something easy for something difficult) does not translate directly from Italian to English like this and would sound more natural as "he mistook flies for flasks". However, without further context it's impossible to determine whether or not the original sentence might be used intentionally for effect, so I will assume that it is acceptable.
1	The sentence "Maria fece una seduta di elioterapia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian structure for past tense sentences with an auxiliary verb (fece) and a past participle (seduta). Additionally, all of the words are correctly used and spelled according to their intended meanings.
1	The sentence "Andrea took the train." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb takes its singular form ("took") when referring to a single third person subject ("Andrea"). Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are present and used correctly (article + definite noun phrase as direct object).
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject. In this case, "redazione" is singular and requires the third person singular form of the verb which is "è", not the plural form "sono". Therefore, the sentence should read as follows: "È stata persa troppa volta(e) il treno, nella (questa) redazione."
1	The sentence "La bussola fu perduta da Gabriele" is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense of the verb "perdere" (perse) correctly with the subject "la bussola". Additionally, the preposition "da" followed by "Gabriele" indicates that the compass was lost by him.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement or word usage. The verb "controlled" agrees with the singular third person subject "Andrea," and the past tense of the verb is appropriate for the sequence of events described in the sentence. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly.
1	The sentence "Edoardo is a chemist" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees with its singular subject "Edoardo." Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are present and correctly used (article, noun, etc.).
0	The verb "mettere" requires the use of the third person singular form "mette", not the first person singular form "mi metto". Additionally, there is no object for the verb to act upon, which makes the sentence grammatically incorrect. A possible correction could be: "Tommaso pose il suo giudizio." (Translation: "Tommaso expressed his opinion.")
0	The verb "dire" should be conjugated as "disse" because the subject of the sentence is "Lorenzo" and it is singular, but the object of the sentence "due" (two) requires that the past tense of "dire" be used with an auxiliary verb such as "avere", making the correct form "ha detto". Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be: "Lorenzo ne ha detto due a Maria."
1	The sentence "Beatrice took fools for wise men" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses proper idiomatic expression ("take someone for someone else"). All words are correctly conjugated and punctuated, making this sentence acceptable in formal and informal communication.

1	The sentence "Riccardo tirò l'acqua al proprio mulino" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "tirò" (past tense of "tirare") agrees with its subject "Riccardo," while "l'acqua" is correctly used as the direct object. Finally, "al proprio mulino" uses the preposition "a" followed by an article ("il"), which is standard for indirect objects in Italian. Therefore, this sentence is acceptable.
1	The sentence "Alessandro si diede la zappa sui piedi." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the past tense. Here, "diede" is the third person singular (singular masculine subject) preterite form of the verb dare ("to give"). This form matches the subject "Alessandro," which is also singular and masculine. Additionally, the word order is correct and all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech.
1	The sentence "Emma ascolta un disco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and word order.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha toccato Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper Italian conjugations for the third person singular masculine subject ("Riccardo") with the past tense of the verb "toccare" (ha toccato). Additionally, both names are capitalized properly as they should be at the beginning of a sentence or name.
1	The sentence "Riccardo fa le traduzioni dei bollettini di guerra." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. Here, we have the subject "Riccardo" performing an action "fa," which means "does or makes" and takes a direct object "le traduzioni" meaning "the translations." Overall, this sentence has a clear subject-verb agreement, and there are no other noticeable errors that would make it unacceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means "He mocks you tauntingly."
1	The sentence "Tommaso legge." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian independent clause with a subject ("Tommaso") and a verb ("legge"). In this case, the third person singular present tense form of the verb "leggere" (to read) is used correctly to match the subject "Tommaso".
1	The sentence "Gabriele fa una telefonata a Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here are some reasons why this sentence is grammatically correct: - The subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "fa," which means "makes" or "does" in English. In Italian, verbs must agree with their subjects in number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, third). Here, "Gabriele" is a singular masculine noun that requires the use of the third-person singular form of the present tense of the verb "fare." - The direct object "una telefonata" follows the preposition "a" before the indirect object "Maria". This order respects the canonical word order of SOV (Subject + Object + Verb), where the direct object comes between the subject and the verb, and the indirect object appears after the direct object and the preposition "to" ("a") indicating its role as a recipient or goal. - All words follow standard conventions for gender, number, article usage, etc., such as using the feminine singular definite article "la" to refer to "telefonata", which is also feminine singular. Overall, the sentence "Gabriele fa una telefonata a Maria" is an example of a simple declarative statement written entirely in Italian, without any errors or deviations from accepted norms.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an action (giving) performed by the subject "Tommaso" towards the object "un libro" and specifies the recipient of that action as "Maria". All elements are used correctly according to standard Italian syntax and agreement rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the use of "che" as a conjunction introduces a subordinate clause that explains the reason for another action. This structure allows us to have two different verb forms ("ha" and "è") referring to separate subjects ("Andrea" and "Giulia").
1	The sentence "Riccardo telefona ad Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper preposition in Italian language. Here, "Riccardo" (subject) is singular masculine noun and "telefona" (verb) agrees with the number and gender of the subject. Also, "ad" is used as a preposition before the indirect object "Emma".
1	The sentence "Emma is struggling with her studies" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "Emma." Additionally, the phrase "struggling with her studies" provides more context and clarity to the sentence.
1	The sentence "Leonardo odia Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in Italian and uses the appropriate singular form of the verb "odiare" (to hate) that agrees with the singular subjects "Leonardo" and "Maria".
1	The sentence "Leonardo odia Paola?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking if Leonardo dislikes or hates Paola. The word order and verb form are both appropriate for this type of question in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense of the verb "andare" (Alle+doppio consonante+verbo all'infinito) to indicate that Alessandro went somewhere (in this case, to greet his father). This structure is common in Italian when talking about past actions performed by a specific person or people.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and the verb "girò" agrees with it in number and tense. Also, the phrase "con l'auto" correctly uses the singular definite article "l'" before the masculine noun that starts with a vowel "auto".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "virò" agrees with its subject "il battello", and the direct object of the sentence is the pronoun "loro".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular verb "obbedisce" agrees with its singular subject "Andrea".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rules where "hanno" (plural form of "avere") agrees with its plural subject "soldati". Additionally, there are no apparent word order issues or other errors that would make it incorrect.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ama i bignè" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. "Alessandro" is the subject and "ama" (the third person singular form of the verb) agrees with the subject. Additionally, the direct object "i bignè" comes after the verb as required by standard Italian syntax.
1	The sentence "Il cedro ama la libertà." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb (ama) agrees with its singular subject (il cedro). Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are correctly used and arranged according to Italian syntax rules.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "potato" should be replaced with the past tense of a verb that makes sense in this context, such as "pruned". Additionally, it would be more appropriate to say "the hedge belonging to Edward", since dogs cannot have plants grown on them. So a possible correction could be: "The gardener has pruned the hedge belonging to Edward."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the indirect object pronoun "gli" is used correctly to refer to Alessandro as the recipient of the action. It may seem confusing because we are not used to seeing two masculine singular direct and indirect object pronouns together ("A Lorenzo", "gli"), but it follows standard Italian grammar rules for compound verb forms with more than one object.
1	The sentence "Alessandro beve il suo caffè" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense for the action being performed by the subject of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Alessandro desidera rivedere Beatrice." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. It consists of two nouns, "Alessandro" and "Beatrice", connected by the verb "desidera", which agrees with the subject "Alessandro". Moreover, both nouns are correctly declined according to their gender (masculine for "Alessandro" and feminine for "Beatrice") and number (singular). Therefore, this sentence is perfectly acceptable from a grammar perspective.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. It describes a scene where there is a cat with yellow eyes under the arch of a door. All words are used correctly and agree in number and tense.
1	The sentence "Paola ha coraggio." is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence, "Paola," agrees with the verb "ha" (the third person singular form of "avere") and the object "coraggio" is correctly used as an abstract noun.
1	The sentence "Gabriele seguono una rigida condotta morale" is grammatically incorrect because the subject of the sentence, "Gabriele", is singular and requires the third person singular form of the verb to be used after it. In this case, "segue" should replace "seguono". Therefore, the correct version would be "Gabriele segue una rigida condotta morale."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "practices" agrees with its singular subject "the mosquito". Additionally, the word "morale" is correctly used as a noun to refer to moral principles or values.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the present tense of the verb "to have" (ha) correctly to indicate possession and the past participle form of the verb "to love" (cotta) as an adjective to describe how the refrigerator feels about Francesco.
1	The sentence "Tommaso dette degli schiaffi a Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. The verb "dette" agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso," and the direct object "degli schiaffi" comes before the indirect object "a Maria". Additionally, the article "gli" before "schiaffi" indicates that the action was performed multiple times (plural) but directed at one person (singular).
1	The sentence "Riccardo allungò uno schiaffo a Giulia." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. The subject "Riccardo" comes before the verb "allungò," which agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the subject. Additionally, the indirect object "Giulia" is correctly marked by the preposition "a". Overall, this sentence exhibits proper use of grammatical tense, agreement, and syntax.
1	The sentence "Riccardo resta in silenzio" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, which agrees with the third-person singular verb form "reste." Additionally, "in silenzio" functions as an adverbial phrase that modifies the action expressed by the verb. Therefore, this sentence can be interpreted correctly to mean that "Riccardo remains silent."
1	The sentence "Riccardo non ha più sospetti su Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, "non" is used as a negation before the auxiliary verb "ha," which agrees with its subject "Riccardo" (third person singular). Additionally, the preposition "su" followed by the noun "Emma" indicates the indirect object of the sentence. Overall, the structure and usage of words are appropriate for an acceptable Italian statement.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo receives help from Edoardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement between the subject ("Lorenzo") and the helping verb ("receives").
1	The sentence "Alessandro agita Beatrice" is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. However, it may be helpful to note that this specific verb form ("agita") can have different meanings depending on the context (e.g., stirring something, shaking someone), and its intended meaning here cannot be determined without additional information about the situation described by the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence and the verb that agrees with it is "fa", which is the third person singular form of "fare". Therefore, there are no errors in the given sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo proceeds to load the truck with crates." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. The subject of the sentence, "Riccardo," is singular and the verb "proceeds" agrees with it by also being in the third person singular form. Additionally, the preposition "with" correctly introduets the object of the preposition "the truck with crates". Overall, there are no grammar mistakes or awkward phrasings that would make this sentence difficult for native speakers to understand.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible minor improvement could be to use the article "the" before "stylographic pen", but it does not make the original sentence incorrect or unacceptable.
1	The sentence "La stilografica è caricata" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian Subject-Verb Agreement rule where the singular subject "la stilografica" matches with the singular verb "è". Also, the adjective "caricata" agrees with the gender and number of the noun "stilografica."
1	The sentence "Tommaso rummages through Julia's desk drawers" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and word usage. All parts of speech are used correctly and the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, there are no obvious misspellings or errors in punctuation that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence "Andrea carica l'orologio." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and uses the correct singular form of the verb "caricare" (to load or wind) that agrees with the singular subject "Andrea". Additionally, the article "l'" before "orologio" correctly indicates that we are referring to one watch.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it contains the incorrect form of the verb "to give." In this context, where the subject ("Riccardo") is singular, we need to use the third person singular form "gives," rather than the plural form "give." A corrected version would be: "Riccardo gives many hits to the dog."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that Lorenzo runs up the stairs for the second time.
1	The sentence "Beatrice has the task of kidnapping Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and uses appropriate vocabulary and syntax to convey its intended meaning effectively.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "corre" should agree with the subject "Alessandro," which requires the third person singular form of the verb to be "corre." However, "l'asina" is feminine singular and thus would require the corresponding agreement on the past participle "corso." Therefore, both parts of the verb need to change, resulting in a corrected version like "Alessandro corregge l'asina" or "L'asina viene corridta da Alessandro".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense throughout the sentence. "Francesco" is singular, so we use the third person singular form of the verb "take," which is "takes." Similarly, since "he" (referring to Francesco) is performing an action on "the deer," we also correctly use the third person singular form of the verb "land," which is "lands." All other elements of the sentence are used appropriately as well.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "ha" does not match with its subject "il frigorifero." In Italian, when the subject of the sentence is a singular masculine noun like "il frigorifero," the third person singular form of the verb should be used. Therefore, it should be "Il frigorifero ha incantato un gatto" (The refrigerator has attracted a cat).
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha" (third person singular form of "have") does not agree with its subject "il frigorifero" (masculine singular), which requires the use of the third person plural form of the verb "hanno". A correct version would be "Il frigorifero ha attratto una sedia." ("The refrigerator has attracted a chair.")
1	The sentence "Riccardo has seduced a minor" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate vocabulary and syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, or word usage. Additionally, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning, making it an acceptable English statement.
1	The sentence "Paola has read a book" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a present perfect tense verb ("has read") followed by a past participle form of the main verb ("read"), and the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject it agrees with. In this case, "Maria" is singular, so the verb must also be singular. Therefore, "colleziona" (singular) instead of "collezzionano" (plural) should have been used. A grammatically correct sentence would be: "Maria raccoglie biglietti d'amore."
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha tosato lo zio." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order and uses the correct tense of the verb "tosare" (to shave). Additionally, the definite article "lo" agrees with its masculine singular direct object noun "zio".
1	The sentence "Paola fa una corsa in giardino." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Paola"), verb ("fa") and complement ("una corsa"). Additionally, the use of the singular form "fa" agrees with the third-person singular subject "Paola".
1	The sentence "Riccardo scambia libri con Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. Here, we have two people (Riccardo and Maria) engaging in an action (scambiare), which means "to exchange" or "to trade," with the direct object (libri) coming before the indirect object ("con Maria"). Therefore, this sentence can be interpreted as "Riccardo exchanges books with Maria" or "Riccardo trades books with Maria," depending on context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha" agrees with its singular subject "Alice." Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled, and the structure of the sentence is logical and clear.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "ha" is the auxiliary verb used with "Maria," which is a singular female subject, and it agrees with the past participle "curvato."
1	The sentence "Sofia maintains head at the enemy" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. However, the meaning might not be clear to native speakers without additional context, as maintaining one's head at an enemy could have several interpretations.
1	The sentence "Alessandro si gonfia la testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order and uses proper verb conjugations for both the subject ("Alessandro") and reflexive pronoun ("si"). Additionally, all words are correctly inflected based on their role in the sentence.
0	The verb "piantare" requires the use of the auxiliary verb "avere" instead of "essere", so the correct form is "Beatrice ha piantato in asso Giulia".
1	The sentence "Capire le intenzioni segrete di una persona" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for forming sentences in Italian. It consists of a finite verb (capire) and its complement (le intenzioni segrete di una persona), which agrees with the verb in number and gender.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "cambia", and both are in the third person singular form. Additionally, the object of the sentence, "le carte," is correctly gendered (feminine) and plural to match the verb.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used based on the subject. In this case, "fa" is not grammatically correct because it does not agree with the plural subject "Riccardo". It should be "fanno", or better yet, use a singular subject to maintain consistency and clarity. For example, you could say "Riccardo sta giocando male."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it uses the verb "ha" with two subjects ("Andrea" and "Beatrice"). A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Andrea has broken Beatrice's neck." or "Beatrice's neck was broken by Andrea.", using either the possessive form of the second subject or changing the order of the sentence so that there is only one subject.
0	The correct form should be "La musica rock è assordante" or "Il rock può danneggiare l'udito". In the original sentence, there is an incorrect association of two different ideas - breaking ears and being loud.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although it may sound repetitive or confusing because both names are "Tommaso", the sentence correctly conveys that Riccardo gave something belonging to Tommaso back to him.
1	The sentence "La mosca salta al naso di Riccardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word agreement. All words are used correctly and there are no apparent errors that would make the sentence difficult to understand or incorrect.
0	The sentence "Andare a monte" is not grammatically correct because it is written in two different languages (Italian and English) and lacks proper verb conjugation and subject-verb agreement. A corrected version could be "Going bust" or "To fail", both of which are complete sentences that convey the same idea while being grammatically correct.
0	The phrase is not grammatically correct because it should be "I am at index" instead of "Be at index". In English, we use the verb "to be" as a linking verb to connect the subject with its complement or location. Therefore, when using first person singular, we say "I am", and never just "am".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Putting" is the present participle of the verb "to put", which correctly describes an action that is ongoing or happening now. In this case, it is used with the verb "is" to create the progressive tense.
1	The sentence "Alzare il gomito" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "to raise one's elbow", and it is commonly used to refer to the act of drinking alcohol excessively. Both "alzare" (the infinitive form) and "il gomito" (the singular definite article + noun) are grammatically correct here.
1	The sentence "Perdere il lume della ragione" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and agreement between words. In this case, "perdere" (to lose) agrees with its subject "il lume" (the light), which is singular. Additionally, "del lume" (of the light) modifies "ragione" (reason), indicating that it belongs to or is associated with reason. Therefore, the overall meaning of the phrase suggests losing one's sanity or becoming irrational.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used after "someone". In this case, it should be "for someone" instead of "to someone".
0	The correct phrase is "Be poor as a churchmouse" which literally means to be extremely poor. However, the given sentence contains an error where it says "in canna". It should have been "as a churchmouse", so I assume that was a typo and provide a correction instead of just saying if it's grammatically correct or not because as it stands now, without my suggested change, this sentence would receive a label of 0 due to incorrect phrasing.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and has no obvious errors in word choice or syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There must be an agreement between the subject "ogni bambino" and the verb "ha". In this case, since "bambino" is singular, we use the third person singular form of the verb which is "ha".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be an article "the" before "smoking." So the corrected version of this sentence would be: "A that party, black tie is required."
0	The verb "nuotare" (to swim) is incorrectly used with the subject "la moto di Leonardo". Also, the phrase "di zecca", which means "brand new", should be written as two separate words instead of being attached to "nuota". A grammatically correct sentence could be: "La moto di Leonardo è come nuova." (Leonardo's motorcycle is like new.)
1	The sentence "Ho visto un'unità in marcia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations for the subject-verb agreement.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" does not agree with the verb form "ritorni". It should be "Che Leonardo ritorni piaciA", but even after this correction, it would still sound awkward and unnatural in English. A more natural way to express this idea might be "Maria likes it when Leonardo returns."
1	The sentence "Sofia corre a mangiare" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. Here, the subject "Sofia" is singular and the verb "corre" agrees with it by being in the third person singular form of the present tense. Additionally, the infinitive phrase "a mangiare" functions as an adverbial complement of purpose, providing more information about why or where Sofia is running. Overall, this sentence conveys a coherent idea without any apparent errors or awkwardness that might hinder communication.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "sorride" and the preposition "a" correctly introduces the indirect object "Sofia."
1	The sentence "Beatrice makes sure the article is clear" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses the appropriate verb tense to indicate that Beatrice's action of ensuring clarity is ongoing or habitual. Additionally, the use of the singular form of the definite article ("the") agrees with the singular noun "article."
1	The sentence "Alessandro divorzia da Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian syntax for expressing that someone is getting divorced from their spouse. In this case, the subject of the sentence (Alessandro) is followed by the verb "divorziare" and its direct object ("da Paola").
1	The sentence "Riccardo abita in una casa piccola." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "abita" is the third person singular form of the verb "abitare," which means "to live," and agrees with its subject "Riccardo." Additionally, the article "una" before "casa" correctly indicates that "casa" is feminine singular. Overall, this sentence shows proper agreement between subject and verb as well as gender and number concordance for nouns, making it grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Maria doesn't live in Rome." is grammatically correct as it follows the standard English structure for negations with auxiliary verb (does) followed by base form of the verb (live). Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence, and punctuation marks are used correctly.
1	The sentence "Mille stelle brillano nel cielo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar for subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "brillano" agrees with its plural subject "stelle," which means "stars" in English. Additionally, the adverbial phrase "nel cielo" (in the sky) appears at the end of the sentence, which is also acceptable in Italian.
0	The phrase "Ciò guarda questa cosa" is not grammatically correct because it does not form a complete sentence and lacks proper subject-verb agreement. A more appropriate way to express this idea might be "Ecco cosa sta guardando."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are just minor adjustments that could be made for clarity and flow. For example, "Every day, Leonardo studies them intensely for three hours."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "la parete" is the subject and it agrees with the singular verb "è". Also, the phrase "dalle spalle di Riccardo" correctly indicates that the walls are being touched by Riccardo's shoulders using the preposition "da", which means "from", followed by "le spalle", the plural form of "spalla" (shoulder), indicating possession through the use of "'di'" which means "of". So overall, the sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo tocca la schiena di Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. The subject-verb agreement is respected (the verb "tocca" agrees with its singular subject "Lorenzo"), the word order is appropriate for this type of sentence, and there are no apparent misspellings or incorrect uses of words.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the use of verb tense, subject-verb agreement, word order, or prepositions. All the words are used appropriately and there are no missing elements that would make the sentence difficult to understand. Therefore, I can confirm that this sentence is indeed grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mangia poca fruta." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, "mangia" is the third person singular form of the present tense of the verb "mangiare," which means "to eat." Additionally, "poca" is an adjective that agrees with the gender (feminine) and number (singular) of "fruta." Therefore, there are no grammar errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Andrea beve" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with the number and gender of its subject. In this case, the singular masculine form of the verb "bere" (to drink) is used correctly with the singular masculine subject "Andrea".
1	The sentence "Francesco pizzica con sadismo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco pinches with sadism." In this case, the verb "pizzicare" (to pinch) agrees with its singular subject "Francesco". Additionally, the preposition "con" followed by the noun "sadismo" correctly describes the manner of Francisco's action.
1	The sentence "Alessandro disegna sul muro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses the correct form of the verb "disegnare". In this case, "Alessandro" is the subject, "disegna" (the third person singular present tense of "disegnare") is the verb, and "sul muro" is the object.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo balla la rumba." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are used correctly with respect to their tense, number, gender, etc. In this case, the subject "Lorenzo" is singular and masculine, so the verb "balla" (which means "dances") must be conjugated in third person singular present indicative form. Similarly, "la" before "rumba" indicates that "rumba" is feminine singular, which agrees with the verb.

So, a better version could be "Sigarette intasano lo scarico della fontana.", which means "Cigarettes clog the fountain drain."
