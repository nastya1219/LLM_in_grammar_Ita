label	explanation
0	The verb "voglio" should be followed by the infinitive form of the next verb without "di". Therefore, it should be "Voglio salutare Giulia." instead of "Voglio di salutare Giulia."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible translation to English would be "I feel like saying hi to Sophia."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "my" is used as an adjective to describe the speaker's favorite work, and it agrees with its noun, which is singular (Divina Commedia). So, there should be no confusion here; therefore, I would label this as grammatically correct.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "my favorite train" requires the verb to be in singular form, but it uses the plural form instead. A possible correction could be: "My favorite train is the Orient Express."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the past tense and follows proper subject-verb agreement rules. Each verb agrees with its corresponding subject, "Lorenzo" and "Andrea", respectively. Additionally, the pronouns used are appropriate for each person being referred to, and the word order is logical and clear.
0	The verb "does" is used with third person singular pronouns such as "he", "she", or "it". In this case, the subject of the sentence is the first person plural pronoun "we", so the correct form of the auxiliary verb should be "do": "We don't matter."
1	The sentence "Alessandro has met Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "has met" agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro". Additionally, the past tense of the verb accurately conveys that the action occurred at an earlier time.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "il" agrees with "padre", which is masculine singular, and "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere". Additionally, the past participle "ricomparso" must agree in gender and number with what it refers to; here, that would be "il padre", so we need the masculine singular form "ricomparso".
1	The sentence "I prezzi sono aumentati" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, "prezzi" (prices) is plural and agrees with the verb "sono" (are), which is also in its plural form to match the plural noun. Therefore, there are no errors or issues with the sentence from a grammatical perspective.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "we" is "were", not "ci siamo dati". So, a grammatically correct sentence would be "Salvatore, we were having fun."
1	The sentence "Il palazzo delle assicurazioni è crollato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "il palazzo" (the building) is singular and masculine, so the third person singular present tense form of the verb "essere" (to be), which is "è," must be used. Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no spelling or punctuation errors.
0	In this sentence, there is no explicit subject or verb, which makes it grammatically incorrect and difficult to understand the intended meaning. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (verb).
1	The sentence "Newton explained the force of gravity" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense to describe an event that happened in the past.
1	The sentence "Mi hanno dato il premio" is grammatically correct because the past participle "dato" agrees with the direct object pronoun "mi", and it is correctly used with the auxiliary verb "hanno". In this case, since the subject of the sentence (the people who gave the prize) is not explicitly stated, we use the plural form of the auxiliary verb to indicate that more than one person was involved.
1	The sentence "Tommaso si è danneggiato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard pattern for past tense verbs in Italian. In this case, the auxiliary verb "essere" (to be) is used with the past participle "danneggiato" to indicate that Tommaso caused damage to himself or something else. This construction is commonly used in Italian and does not contain any grammar errors.
1	The sentence "Quegli uomini hanno denunciato se stessi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the plural noun "uomini" agrees with the third person plural verb form "hanno," indicating that multiple men performed an action on themselves ("denunciato se stessi").
0	In this sentence, the use of two different subjects ("compro" is first person singular and "leggo" is also first person singular, but they refer to two different actions) requires the use of two pronouns or noun phrases. Therefore, it should be "Compro e io leggo quel libro." or simply "Compro e leggo quel libri.", which means "I buy and read that book."
1	The sentence "I met Lorenzo not Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for forming sentences with verbs and subjects. In this case, "I" serves as the subject of the sentence while "met" acts as its verb. Additionally, the use of negation through "not" before "Emma" correctly indicates that the speaker did not meet Emma instead of Lorenzo. However, depending on context or intended meaning, one might argue that adding a comma after "Lorenzo" could improve readability and flow (e.g., "I met Lorenzo, not Emma."). Nevertheless, such an addition would not affect the overall grammaticality of the given statement.
0	The correct form of the verb to match with "he" should be used instead of "have". It should be "He doesn't look."
1	The sentence "I met many of Richard's friends" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate form of the verb to agree with the subject and includes the necessary preposition before the possessive noun.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no apparent mistake in the use of verb forms or word order. Additionally, all words are spelled and used correctly according to their intended meanings in context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I haven't found many" is the past tense of "I don't find many," which means that the speaker has not discovered or come across a lot of something recently.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Riccardo"), an action verb ("has promised") that agrees with the subject in number and tense, and a direct object ("la propria casa"). Additionally, there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors. Overall, this sentence demonstrates good control of English syntax and morphology.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject and "ha salutato" is the conjugated verb for third person singular (ella/egli/esso) of the passato prossimo tense which corresponds to the English past simple tense. Therefore, it agrees with the subject "Maria".
1	The sentence "Riccardo doesn't have many friends" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of English negations with auxiliary verb (does) + not + base form of the main verb (have). Also, the subject-verb agreement is respected as the singular noun "Riccardo" matches with the third person singular form of the verb "has".
1	The sentence "Riccardo doesn't think that Mario and Luigi are very intelligent" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rules, where the verb agrees with the number of the subject (in this case, "Mario and Luigi," which is plural). Additionally, the use of negation ("doesn't") before the main verb ("think") is also appropriate for the third person singular subject "Riccardo."
0	The verb "hanno" does not agree with its subject "people". The correct form of the verb should be "have", which agrees with the plural subject. Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence is: "People have called that number many times."
1	The sentence "Che cosa ha comprato Riccardo?" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an interrogative sentence in Italian, with the subject pronoun "che cosa" (what thing) preceding the verb "ha comprato" (has bought). Additionally, the use of the third person singular masculine form of the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have), "ha," agrees with the past participle "comprato."
1	The sentence "Andrea has met Leo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Andrea"), auxiliary verb ("has") and past participle form of the main verb ("met"). Additionally, the word order is also correct, as well as the use of the third person singular for the auxiliary verb.
0	The correct form of the past tense of "to be" after "he" or "him" is "was", not "were". So, the sentence should read: "Riccardo asked by whom he had not been seen."
1	The sentence "Leonardo, mi han detto que parlará mañana." is grammatically correct. Although the subject of the second clause changes from first person singular to third person singular between Spanish and English, this does not affect the grammaticality of the sentence. Additionally, "han" agrees with the plural subject "mi", so there are no errors in agreement or tense.
1	The sentence "Gabriele, when did you see him?" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for asking a question about a specific time in the past. The subject "you" has a helping verb "did", and the verb tense agrees with the subject. Also, the pronoun "he" refers clearly to someone mentioned before or known by the listener.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "ha" agrees with its subject "Leonardo", and the preposition "in" before "quale cassetto" is used correctly to indicate where something is located.
0	The sentence should be "Quale político ha parlato?" instead of "Quale politco hanno parlato?". In Italian, the singular form "ha" must be used with the singular subject "politico", not the plural form "hanno".
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of the repeated use of relative pronouns "that" and the lack of clarity about who said what on the radio. A clearer version could be: "It was reported on the radio that a certain politician had spoken; the judge then declared something about this."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo said that he will leave tomorrow." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and punctuation rules. Additionally, the use of past tense ("said") correctly indicates that the action occurred before another time (the present), while the future tense ("will leave") refers to an event that has not yet happened.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Francesco" is the subject of the dependent clause and the verb "è arrivato" agrees with it in number and person. Also, "abbiamo potuto" is the auxiliary verb used to form the compound past tense (passato prossimo) for the main clause, which also agrees with its plural subject "noi".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper word order. Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated for their intended meaning.
1	The sentence "Alessandro, who came to visit me yesterday, told me to greet you." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an independent clause ("Alessandro told me to greet you.") and a dependent relative clause ("who came to visit me yesterday"). All the verb conjugations are consistent with their respective subjects.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It is written in standard Italian with proper use of verb tense, subject-verb agreement, and word order.
1	The sentence "Il timore della guerra è ingiustificato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. Here, "timore" (fear) is the subject and "è" (is) agrees with it as a singular third-person masculine noun. Additionally, "della guerra" (of war) is correctly used to describe what the fear is about. Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha perso le chiavi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require a singular verb and plural subjects require a plural verb. In this case, "Riccardo" is a singular noun, so we use the third person singular form of the verb "ha perduto," which is "ha perso." Additionally, the definite article "le" agrees with the gender (feminine) and number (plural) of the object "chiavi."
1	The sentence "Alessandro is eager for power" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees in number with the subject. In this case, the singular subject "Alessandro" matches with the singular verb "is." Additionally, the word "eager" is used correctly as an adjective to describe the intensity of Alessandro's desire for power.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In the subject "Francesco" and "Lorenzo" are both nouns referring to male individuals so we use the third person plural form of the verb "domanda" which is "domandano". However, since there are two subjects acting together with one action (interrogating), it requires the conjugated verb to be in its third person plural form as well ("domandano"). Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha affermato che Edoardo parla." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for present tense regular verbs like "parlare" (to speak). The subject-verb agreement is also respected as "Edoardo" is singular and "parla" agrees with it by being in its third person singular form.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a complex sentence with an independent clause ("Il signor Rossi andrà al cinema") and a dependent clause ("mentre sua moglie legge un libro"). Both clauses are correctly constructed and separated by the conjunction "mentre".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the elements are used appropriately and there are no apparent errors in syntax or verb agreement.
0	The correct form of the past tense of "essere" (to be) should be used after "il fatto di". In this case, it should be "è stato", since "delitto" is masculine singular. Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be: "Il fatto di essere stati scoperti un delitto ci ha sconvolti."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a question asking who the speaker thinks Alessandro will meet.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "The chair you sat on is broken."
0	The phrase is not grammatically correct because it lacks proper pronoun-antecedent agreement and uses the wrong tense for one of the verbs. A corrected version could be: "This is the person about whom Eduardo made the statement that Tommaso spoke."
0	The verb "crede" should agree with the subject "Edoardo", so it should be "Edoardo crede che Sophia l'abbia baciato". Also, "chi" is not necessary here and changes the meaning of the sentence; instead, use "che".
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used after "we". In this case, it should be "are" instead of "is". Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be: "We aren't sure what problem we can't solve."
0	The correct form of the verb "to have" should be used after "he". In this case, it should be "has", not "ha". So the grammatically correct sentence is: "He has seen him."
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject in number and person. In this case, it should be "we have seen him", because "we" is plural and requires the verb "have".
1	The sentence "Sofia says that Alessandro will speak tomorrow" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. Subject-verb agreement is respected (Sofia says), as well as tense consistency (will speak). Also, there are no misspelled words or incorrect word order.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the reflexive pronoun "se stessa" is incorrectly used and positioned in the sentence. Also, there are some missing words for better clarity. A corrected version could be: "Beatrice declared that she had nothing to do with Gabriele."
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha detto che Andrea si è guardato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses the appropriate tense to indicate that the action was completed in the past. Additionally, each verb agrees with its corresponding subject in number (singular or plural).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word usage or punctuation. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as acceptable and grammatically accurate.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice or syntax. All the pronouns and verbs agree with their respective subjects. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as acceptable in formal writing.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a complex structure with three nested subjunctive clauses ("che Emma voglia", "che Tommaso veda") that express doubt or uncertainty about the actions of the individuals involved. All verbs are correctly conjugated according to their tense and subject, making this sentence grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Il coniglio mangia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian language where singular subjects require a singular verb and vice versa. In this case, "coniglio" (rabbit) is singular and requires the third person singular present tense of the verb "mangiare," which is "mangia." Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English, the subject-auxiliary inversion that occurs in questions moves both "that" and the auxiliary verb "does", so the sentence becomes "Does that book say...?" instead of "Does book that say...". Additionally, there are no obvious grammar mistakes in terms of word choice or agreement throughout the entire sentence.
0	In the sentence "She don't like to eat vegetables," there is an incorrect usage of verb agreement. The third person singular subject "she" should be followed by the form "doesn't" instead of "don't". Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be "She doesn't like to eat vegetables."
1	The sentence "Arriva un uomo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. "Arriva" is the third person singular form of the verb "arrivare," which agrees with the subject "un uomo." Additionally, word order is also correct as subjects usually come before verbs in Italian sentences.
1	The sentence "Leonardo uccise Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a simple past tense verb (uccise). Both subjects and verbs agree in number, so there are no errors related to subject-verb agreement or any other issues that would make this sentence unacceptable in formal written or spoken communication.
1	The sentence "Andrea ha detto che Tommaso lo guarda" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject-verb agreement is respected (ha detto - third person singular), and the pronoun "lo" correctly refers to the direct object of the second verb ("Tommaso lo guarda"). Additionally, the use of the past tense ("ha detto") indicates that the action was completed before another one took place.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha voglia di andare al mare." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where singular subjects require a singular verb form (ha) and plural subjects require a plural verb form (hanno). Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correct form of the past tense "had had" to express that the action of reading the book happened before another past action (aveva mai letto). Additionally, the word order and agreement between subject ("questo libro") and verb are also correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the form of a question and it uses appropriate verb conjugations for each subject ("Da quel professore" takes third person singular "è", while "Tommaso" takes third person singular "è stato").
1	The sentence "Alessandro crede che invaderemo quel paese" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "crede" is the third person singular form of the verb "credere", which agrees with its subject "Alessandro". Similarly, "invaderemo" is the first person plural form of the verb "invadere", which matches with its subjects "noi" (implicit) and "quel paese" (the country being referred to). All other elements in the phrase are also used correctly according to their part of speech and function within the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no apparent error in the use of tense, agreement, word choice or syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense "scriveva" to describe what happened last year and present perfect continuous tense "has not finished yet" to indicate that something started in the past and continues up until now.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the past tense ('scrisse') to describe an action completed in the past and in the present perfect tense ('has not finished') to link that past event to the current moment, when Eduardo still hasn't completed his book.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correct form of the verb "to be" for each subject and there are no other apparent errors.
1	The sentence "The current king of France is bald." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for making a statement in English and uses words that are appropriate for their intended meaning. In this case, we have a subject ("the current king of France") which is clearly identified, followed by a verb ("is"), and ending with an adjective describing the subject ("bald"). There is no apparent error or violation of any rules regarding syntax, word choice, or agreement between subject and verb; therefore, I would label this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Qualche studente ha superato l'esame" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. It features the plural form "studenti", which agrees with the number indicated by the quantifier "qualche". Additionally, the verb "ha superato" matches the singular third-person subject "qualche studente".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past perfect tense ("had studied") to indicate that the action of studying happened before another past action (implied by "then failed"). This is appropriate for expressing a sequence of events in the past.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("have promised") and a main verb ("to part"). Additionally, the tense used (past simple) matches the time expression "yesterday".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A subject-verb agreement is present and the verb "dichiarò" agrees with its singular subject "la corte". Additionally, the use of past tense is consistent throughout the sentence.
0	The verb "like" must be used instead of "likes." Therefore, the correct form is: "They don't like to play football."
1	The sentence "Ho preso le chiavi" is grammatically correct because it follows the proper Italian verb conjugation for "ho preso" (I took) and uses the plural form of "le chiavi" correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, or word usage. The punctuation and capitalization are also accurate. Good job!
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb tense and agreement.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used after "neither" which is "is", not "are". Therefore, the sentence "Neither of them are available." is grammatically incorrect and it should be "Neither of them is available."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Uso" is the first person singular of the present indicative tense of the Italian verb "usare," which means "to use." Therefore, it should be followed by the singular subject "il gladio" (the sword).
1	The sentence "Il calcolatore funziona bene" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here are some reasons why this sentence is considered correct: - The subject "il calcolatore" agrees with the verb "funziona" in number (singular) and gender (masculine). - The adverb "bene" modifies the verb phrase "funziona bene," providing more information about how well the calculator works. Overall, there are no apparent errors or violations of Italian grammar in this sentence.
0	The sentence is missing the subject and verb. It should start with "I" or another pronoun followed by a form of the verb "to be". For example, it could say "I am sorry." Also, there should be a question mark at the end since it is a question.
1	The sentence "Le ragazze sono arrivate." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "sono" (which means "are") agrees with its plural subject "le ragazza" (which means "the girls").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The sentence expresses a clear idea and all the words are used appropriately. Well done!
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules.
1	The sentence "Legge velocemente" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an action (verb) being performed quickly (adverb). In this case, "leggere" is the verb and "velocemente" is the adverb describing how the action is being done.
0	The verb "ho" is the first person singular of the present perfect tense, but it does not agree with its subject "I". It should be "Sono andato a casa", since "sono" is the first person singular of the indicative present tense which is used to form the present perfect tense together with the past participle "andato".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "I" (the singular first person pronoun) matches with the verb form "sto" which indicates present continuous tense of "stare." Therefore, there are no errors or exceptions to note in this sentence.
1	The sentence "It isn't true that the appearance of places changes like the face of men." is grammatically correct. There are no obvious errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is an imperative statement ordering someone to go home.
1	The sentence "Io sono affamato." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian sentences where the verb must agree with its subject in number and gender. In this case, the singular first person pronoun "Io" matches with the third person present tense of the verb "essere" which is "sono". However, since "affamat*O*" is an adjective here, we need to consider its form too. Its masculine singular form agrees with both the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the speaker ("Io"). Therefore, the whole sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense "bravo" correctly to compliment someone's behavior or actions. Additionally, "this" agrees with its plural noun "ragazzi," but using an article such as "un bravo ragazzo" would also be acceptable and convey a similar meaning.
1	The sentence "Paola è una donna che apprezziamo molto." is grammatically correct as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper conjugations for each verb tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the interrogative form and asks about future plans for tomorrow.
1	The sentence "Ho visto il libro che mi hai regalato" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and the verb "ho visto" agrees with its subject "Io". Also, there is no missing punctuation or incorrect word order that could make it unacceptable.
0	In this sentence, there is no verb that agrees with the subject "gli amici", which should be followed by a third person plural form of the verb. Additionally, there is an incorrect use of the possessive adjective "whose" instead of "of whose". A correct version could be: "Gli amici di cui il maestro è Andrea."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular form of the verb ("pencil" is conjugated as "pencils") followed by an adverb ("carefully"). Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the past participle "si è fatto" agrees with the subject "lui" (implicit) and it means that something or someone has caused him to get hurt as a result of falling down.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense consistently and all verb forms agree with their subjects in number. "Volevano" (them-plural wanted) matches with "distruggerla" (to destroy her-singular), while "l'hanno" (they-plural have-past tense) agrees with "distrutta" (destroyed-feminine singular).
0	The verb "prenda" is in the singular form and should be changed to the plural form "prendano" to agree with the subject "ognuno". Also, it would sound more natural to say "Prendete ognuno il vostro cappotto." or "Ognuno prenda il proprio cappotto."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "take" (the verb) agrees with "I" (the subject) in number and person. Additionally, the article "that" before "aggregate" helps to make the meaning of the sentence clearer.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("I"), an action verb ("have given") and an object ("the milk"). Then it includes the indirect object ("to the child") and completes with the consequence of the action ("but he didn't drink it").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses that are correctly joined by the conjunction "io" which means "I". Both subjects and verbs agree within their respective clauses.
1	The sentence "I saw a house" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object structure and uses appropriate verb tense and agreement.
1	The sentence "Ho visto tua madre" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, the singular verb form "ho visto" (I saw) agrees with the singular subject "Io" (I), which may not be explicitly stated but implied. Additionally, the noun phrase "tua madre" (your mother) functions as an object in this sentence and does not affect the number or form of the verb.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be an article before "person" but since it is referring to a specific person mentioned earlier in the conversation or context, leaving out the definite article "the" is acceptable and common in English language usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("one"), verb ("goes") and object ("comfort"). The word "in" before "treno" is used correctly as it indicates the means of transportation.
1	The sentence "Fa male la mia testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing discomfort or pain in Italian. In this case, "fa" (the third person singular form of the verb "fare") is used with "male" to indicate that something is wrong or hurting. Additionally, "la mia testa" correctly uses the definite article "la" before "testa" since it refers to a specific part of the body belonging to the speaker.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that the speaker or writer possesses two houses.
0	The correct form of the verb to have with "I" or "il/lo/la/l'" is "ho", not "hai". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence should be "Ho una casa." instead of "Ho hai casa."
0	The correct phrase should be "I don't have any." instead of the double negative used here ("don't have none").
1	The sentence "The horse is a strong animal" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees with the number and person of its subject. In this case, the singular third-person subject "horse" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb form "is." Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are appropriate for formal written English.
1	The sentence "È venuto qualcuno" is grammatically correct because the verb "è venuto" agrees with the singular subject "qualcuno." In Italian, as in English, we use a form of the auxiliary verb "to be" to indicate that an action has been completed (passato prossimo), and this form changes depending on whether the subject is singular or plural. Here, since "qualcuno" is singular, we need to use the third person singular form "è," which means "he/she/it has come." So, the translation for "Is someone here?" would actually be "C'è qualcuno?" instead.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "He has arrived" is the past tense of "he arrives," and it indicates that at some point in the past, he reached his destination.
1	The sentence "Posso venire" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for forming an interrogative sentence in Italian by using the auxiliary verb "posso" (can) and then adding the infinitive form of the main verb "venire" (to come).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the appropriate form of the verb "piovere" (piova) that agrees with the subject "magari domani".
1	The sentence "Lui è stato colto dalla pioggia." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "lui" is the singular masculine subject, so we use "è," which is the third person singular form of the verb "essere" (to be). Additionally, the adjective "pioggia" agrees with its gender and number, as required by Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Scrive una lettera a sua zia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. Here, "scrive" (third person singular form of the verb "scrivere") agrees with its subject "he/she", and appears before the direct object "una lettera". Additionally, the preposition "a" correctly introduces the indirect object "sua zia".
1	The sentence "Egli lo vedeva" is grammatically correct. It is the Italian imperfect tense of the verb "vedere", meaning "to see". In this case, "egli" (he) is the subject and "lo" (it or him) is the direct object.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a complete sentence with a subject ("Alessandro"), predicate ("promettes ad Edoardo di restare a casa") and an object ("Edoardo"). Additionally, all words are used correctly according to their context within the sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non ha tempo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "ha," which is in the third-person singular form. Additionally, the phrase "non ha tempo" correctly conveys that Riccardo does not have time.
1	The sentence "Ho riparato il tavolo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian verbs. In this case, the first person singular form of the verb "riparare" (to fix) is used correctly with the masculine singular direct object "il tavolo".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "hanno" is the third person plural form of the verb "avere," which means "to have." It agrees with its subject "they" or "those people." Additionally, "aprire" is the infinitive form of the verb "aprire," which means "to open." So, "Hanno aperto il libro" can be translated as "They opened the book."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "le" is used as a plural indirect object pronoun (referring to more than one female or feminine noun), and it agrees with the subject "they." Additionally, "è" is correctly conjugated for the third person singular verb form, which matches the masculine gender of the direct object "il cappello" (the hat).
1	The sentence "Quel ragazzo apre la porta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian and all of the words are correctly conjugated for gender and number.
1	The sentence "Ho sentito cantare i ragazzi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a conjugated verb and its direct object. In this case, "ho sentito" (I heard) is the conjugated verb and "cantare i ragazzi" (singing the boys) is the direct object.
0	The subject of the sentence is "la macchina" which requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb to agree with it. Therefore, "vuole" should be replaced by "vogliono" to match the plurality of the direct object pronoun "la". A correct version would be: "La macchina le vuole lavare."
1	The sentence "Is it raining?" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an interrogative sentence in English, which requires an auxiliary verb (in this case, "is") before the subject to form a question. Additionally, the verb tense agrees with the third person singular pronoun "it."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "È" is the correct form of the third person singular of the verb "venire". However, note that there could be some variations depending on regional usage or dialects. But for standard Italian, this sentence is correct.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "al bagno" which is singular and requires the use of "fa" instead of "fanno". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be "Quanto al bagno, mi fa piacere."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Hai presente Lorenzo?" can be translated to "Do you know Lorenzo?" and it follows the standard structure of an interrogative sentence in Italian, with the subject pronoun "tu" (you) being omitted because it is understood from context.
0	In this sentence, there is a missing question mark at the end of the sentence to indicate that it is a question. Additionally, "da when" should be changed to "when" for proper phrasing of the question. The corrected sentence would be: "When did he move to America?"
0	The correct phrase should be "I don't know if it is possible" instead of "I don't know if it are possible". In this case, the verb should agree with its subject, so "it" requires the singular form of the verb "is", rather than the plural form "are".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate punctuation marks. Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "Strong winds over the sea can cause stormy seas."
0	The sentence "Piangere forte" is not grammatically correct because it lacks a subject and the verb form used ("piangere") does not agree with an implied subject. A possible correction could be "Lui piange forte," which means "He cries loudly."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "have" agrees with its subject "I", and "taken" correctly follows the auxiliary verb to form the present perfect tense. Additionally, the phrase "a kind of cat" is an acceptable way to describe a specific type of animal.
1	The sentence "Ho preso dello zucchero" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, the first person singular form of the verb "prendere" (to take) agrees with its singular subject "Io". Also, the use of the definite article "lo" before "zucchero" indicates that the speaker is referring to a specific amount of sugar previously mentioned or known by the listener.
1	The sentence "Non mi piacciono i vini." is grammatically correct because it uses the plural form of the verb "piacere" (to like) which agrees with the subject "i vini". In English, you would say "I don't like wines.", where the verb changes according to the subject too.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of the subject "quel che vendo" and the predicate "è merce cinese". The verb "è" agrees with the singular noun "merce", so there are no errors to be corrected.
0	The correct phrase should be "Hurry up," not "Mettere fretta." In English, the imperative form of verbs is often used without subject pronouns (you), so it would just be "hurry" instead of "hurry you." However, since this sentence was given in Italian, it should follow the proper Italian language rules and conjugations.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A competition has indeed been banned.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure and agreement rules for English verbs and subjects. "Balena" is the subject of the sentence and its plural form is used correctly with the verb "must be".
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, "them" is plural and requires the verb "are", so the sentence should read "Mette(s)telo bene in capo (to) them." instead of "Mettilo bene in capo are".
0	The correct form should be "This machine is old but new", since the adjective "new" must agree with "machine" and thus take the same form (in this case, singular). Additionally, it is not clear what "but new" means in this context - perhaps you meant to say "old, yet still functional"?
1	The sentence "Leonardo doesn't know María" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Leonardo"), a negation verb ("doesn't") and an object ("María"). Moreover, all the words are correctly conjugated and spelled.
1	The sentence "Il governo ha abolito la legge" is grammatically correct because the subject "il governo" agrees with the verb "ha abolito" in number and person, and the definite article "la" correctly precedes the noun "legge".
1	The sentence "Ho spazzolato le scarpe." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. Here, the subject "Io" (I) which is implied but not explicitly stated, agrees with the verb "ho spazzolato" (have brushed) as both are singular. Additionally, the article "le" before "scarpe" indicates that the noun "scarpe" (shoes) is feminine plural, requiring an appropriate adjective or past participle to agree with its gender and number, which has been done correctly in this case by using the past participle "spazzolato".
1	The sentence "Tommaso abita da dieci anni" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "abitare" agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso." Additionally, the adverbial phrase "da dieci anni" indicates how long he has been living there, making the sentence complete and meaningful.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha dato un libro a Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper singular forms of verbs for each subject. In this case, "ha" is used correctly with the singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, all nouns ("libro", "Sofia") are properly gendered according to Italian language rules.
1	The sentence "Maria ha corso per ore" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian where the verb "ha corso" (third person singular form of the verb "correre") agrees with its subject "Maria." Additionally, word order and tense are also used correctly.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha bevuto un caffè" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha bevuto" (has drunk) agrees with its singular subject "Francesco". Also, all words are correctly conjugated and there are no spelling errors.
1	The sentence "Andrea has found a ticket for the opera." is grammatically correct because it follows all of the rules of standard English grammar and usage. The subject-verb agreement is correct (Andrea is singular, so we use the third person singular form "has"), and the word order is also appropriate.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject and "sta compilando" is the verb in its gerund form, indicating an ongoing action.
0	The verb "emanate" requires an object to complete its meaning, so the sentence "Emanare profumo." is not grammatically correct because it lacks an object. A corrected version of this sentence could be: "Emanano un piacevole profumo di fiori." (They emit a pleasant scent of flowers.)
0	The sentence is missing the subject of the verb "aprire". A correct version could be "Io apro un nuovo negozio" or "Lui apre un nuovo negozio", where "Io" and "Lui" are the subjects.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (verb). Therefore, "Iniziare un'attività" should be either "Si inizia un'attività." or "Tu inizi un'attività.", depending on the context and intended meaning.
1	The sentence "La porta si è chiusa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the subject "la porta" (the door) is singular, so the verb "si è chiusa" (has closed) must also be singular.
1	The sentence "Gabriele non ammette di essere preso in giro" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and agree with each other in number and gender. Additionally, the verb "ammettere" agrees with its subject "Gabriele" in person and number. Furthermore, the subordinate clause "di essere preso in giro" has a consistent use of passive voice and matches the tense of the main clause. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Paola has returned the book" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English verb agreement rules. In this case, the third person singular subject ("Paola") matches with the present perfect tense of the verb "to have" (has) and the past participle form of the verb "to return" (returned). Additionally, the article "the" preceding "book" correctly specifies which particular book is being referred to.
0	The correct form of the verb "to take" should be used after "what". It should be "What did he take?" or "What has he taken?" instead.
1	The sentence "Le scarpe si sono macchiate" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere" ("si è") to match with the plural subject "le scarpe". Additionally, the past participle "macchiate" agrees with the gender and number of the noun "scarpe." Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Le giornate" (the days) is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the plural form of the verb "si sono accorciate" (they have shortened).
1	The sentence "Qualcosa ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("qualcosa"), a verb ("ha accorciato") and an object ("le giornate"). Also, each word is correctly conjugated according to its gender and number.
1	The sentence "Qualcuno ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, "qualcuno" (someone) is the subject, "ha accorciato" (has shortened) is the conjugated verb that agrees with the singular subject "qualcuno," and "le giornate" (the days) is the direct object. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Aggrapparsi a un ramo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and verb conjugation for the third person singular (aggrappa) with the definite article ("un") and noun ("ramo").
1	The sentence "Arenated themselves, the crews disembarked." is grammatically correct. There are no obvious errors in subject-verb agreement, word usage, or syntax. However, without additional context it's difficult to say for certain if every word choice and phrasing is ideal. But as far as basic grammar goes, this sentence appears to be error-free.
1	The sentence "The fog disappeared" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("the fog") and a verb in past tense ("disappeared"). The word choice and order are appropriate for the intended meaning.
0	The verb "piangere" should be conjugated as "piange" (third person singular) instead of "si piange" (reflexive form). Also, there is no need for the pronoun "si" because "Alessandro" is already mentioned. A correct version would be: "Alessandro piagne sempre."
1	The sentence "Riccardo si lagna always" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. "Si lagna" is the third-person singular form of the verb "lagnarsi", which agrees with the subject "Riccardo". The word "always" is correctly translated as "sempre" in Italian. Therefore, this sentence can be considered acceptable without any corrections needed.
1	The sentence "Alle sue parole, Maria ha annuito" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "alle sue parole" is a dative phrase that functions as the subject of the sentence, while "Maria" serves as its agentive modifier. Moreover, "ha annuito" represents the third-person singular form (conjugated with an auxiliary verb) for the past tense to indicate completed action, which agrees with the number and gender of "Maria." Therefore, this sentence is acceptable in written or spoken contexts without causing confusion or ambiguity.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, tense usage, or word choice. "L'acqua" (water) is singular and requires the use of the third person singular verb form "sgorgata" (gushed). Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Andrea yawned?" is grammatically correct because it follows the structure of a question asking about an action performed by someone in the past simple tense. In this case, the verb "yawned" is used correctly as the past form of "yawn". Additionally, the subject "Andrea" and the auxiliary verb "has" are not required for this type of question since the time frame has already been established with the use of the past tense.
1	The sentence "Riccardo pedala" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "pedalare" (to pedal) agrees with its singular masculine subject "Riccardo". In this case, the third person present tense of "pedalare", which is "pedala", matches the gender and number of the subject "Riccardo". Therefore, there are no grammar mistakes in this sentence.
0	The past participle "approfittato" should be used with the auxiliary verb "essere", which is "è" for third person singular masculine or feminine, not "ha". So it should be "Ha approfittato dell'esperienza." instead of "È approfittato dell'esperienza."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense and punctuation. "Il figlio" is the singular subject of the sentence, which requires the use of the third person singular verb form "si siede." Additionally, "Francesco" is used as an attributive noun to identify which child belongs to him, making it clear that there is only one son being referred to. The time expression "alle 8 in punto" indicates a specific point in time when the action occurs. Overall, the sentence conveys its intended meaning clearly and accurately.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Quando" can be translated as "when," indicating that the action of the second clause happens after the first one. In this case, "il figlio di Leonardo" (Leonardo's son) is the subject of the sentence, which agrees with the singular verb "sedeva" (was sitting). Additionally, there are no missing or extra words in the sentence.
0	The verb "ammuffire" requires the use of a singular noun as its subject. In this case, "un giorno" (one day) would be grammatically correct instead of "una giornata". Also, there is no article before "giornata", which should be "una giornatA". Additionally, it seems that "in" may not be necessary here and could simply be "Il muro ammuffisce in una giornata.", but without more context, I cannot confirm if the sentence still makes sense with just "il muro ammuffisce una giornata."
1	The sentence "Paola is playing a piece by Bach" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with the number and person of its subject. In this case, the subject "Paola" is singular, so the verb "is" should also be singular. Additionally, the preposition "by" is correctly used to indicate that the piece being played was composed by Bach.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "canta" agrees with its subject "il coro," which is plural. In English, you might be tempted to say "the choir sings well" instead of "the choir **sing** well." However, in Italian, just like in Spanish or French, verbs must agree in number and gender with their subjects. So here, since "coro" is masculine plural, we use the form "cantano", not "canta".
1	The sentence "Riccardo aspirava sempre il fumo del sigaro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "aspirava" (past tense of "aspirare") agrees with its subject "Riccardo," while "il fumo" (the smoke) is the direct object of the verb "aspirare." Additionally, "del sigaro" functions as an adjectival phrase modifying "fumo." Therefore, this sentence demonstrates proper usage of agreement between subjects and verbs, word order, and function of phrases within the context of the clause.
1	The sentence "Andrea aspires to become a doctor" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense. Here, the subject "Andrea" is singular and the verb "aspiras" agrees with the number of the subject by being in third person singular present form. Furthermore, the infinitive verb "to become" correctly describes what the subject wants to achieve in his future career. Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo doesn't have to cook today" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format of subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense. Here, the subject "Lorenzo" agrees with the third person singular form of the verb "doesn't have." Additionally, the use of present simple tense is appropriate for expressing general truths or habits.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "la lettera" is singular and requires the verb to be in its third person singular form "scrive". However, the present tense of the verb "scrivere" when used with a third-person singular subject should end in "-e", making it "scrive". Therefore, the correct version would be "La lettera scrive."
0	The verb "disturb" should be followed by the object pronoun "you", so it should say "Do you disturb..." instead of just "Disturb?"
1	The sentence "Leonardo is writing" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for forming an English present continuous tense verb ("is" + base form of the verb) and agrees with the subject "Leonardo".
1	The sentence "Riccardo non scrive più da un pezzo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular (non + present tense of the auxiliary verb "essere" = non è; past participle of the main verb "scrivere" = scritto). Additionally, the adverbial phrase "da un pezzo" correctly indicates that some time has passed since Riccardo last wrote.
1	The sentence "Il macchinista si è fermato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian conjugation for the third person singular of the verb "fermare" (to stop) in the passato prossimo tense, which matches with the subject "il macchinista".
0	The verb "hanno" does not agree with the subject "I negozianti". It should be "è" to match the singular form of "il prezzo", which is implied as the object of the sentence. A correct version would be: "Il prezzo che i negoziani offrono è aumentato." (The price that the retailers offer has increased.)
1	The sentence "I bicchieri si sono rotti" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate singular or plural form of verbs based on the subject. In this case, "si sono rotti" agrees with the plural noun "bicchieri."
1	The sentence "Paola ha acceso il fuoco." is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and follow Italian syntax rules. In this case, "ha" is the auxiliary verb that must be used with "Paola", which is feminine singular; "acceso" agrees with the past participle of the verb "accendere"; and "il fuoco" is the direct object, using the definite article "il".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple past tense verb ("has improved") being used with its corresponding subject ("the stay in Canada"). Additionally, the use of the possessive determiner "his" before "English" indicates ownership and agreement with the subject.
1	The sentence "La lezione ha continuato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. Here, "la lezione," which means "the lesson," serves as the subject and agrees with the singular verb form "ha continuato." This phrase translates to "The lesson continued" in English.
1	The sentence "Saltare un ostacolo." is grammatically correct because it is an Italian imperative sentence that means "Jump over an obstacle" in English. Imperatives are typically single-verb commands or requests and don't require the subject to be explicitly stated.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. All verbs agree with their subjects in number (singular or plural), and in this case, the verb "have" is correctly used in the past tense to match the plural subject "all."
1	The sentence "Si è macchiata la tovaglia" is grammatically correct because it uses the reflexive verb "si è macchiata" correctly with the subject "la tovaglia". In English, this would translate to "The tablecloth has stained itself", where "si è macchiata" serves as both an auxiliary verb and a passive voice marker for the past participle of the verb "macchiare" (to stain).
1	The sentence "Macchia il vino." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian imperative sentence with the subject (you) implied and understood from context. In this case, "macchia" is the verb in its second person singular form ("tu macchia"), addressed to someone else, telling them to stain the wine. If you meant something different or if there was more information about the intended meaning, please let me know!
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English, we use the verb "to be" to indicate the state of something (e.g., hot, cold). Here, "is" agrees with the subject "the water." Additionally, it's common and acceptable to say that something "is frozen" or "has frozen," but using "gelata" also works in this context as an adjective describing the current state of the water.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject. In this case, "le tappe" is plural and requires the use of the third person plural form of the verb. Therefore, it should be "Le tappe hanno bruciato", but since the sentence mentions an hour (un'ora), I assume that what was meant is something like "The stages lasted for an hour". So, if we want to express that idea correctly, one possibility could be "I tempi di percorrenza delle tappe sono durati un'ora."
1	The sentence "Il vetro si rompe" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "il vetro" (the glass) is the subject, and "si rompe" (breaks itself) is the verb phrase. In this case, "si" is used as an impersonal reflexive pronoun that agrees with the third person singular subject "il vetro." Therefore, the use of "si" instead of other forms such as "siamo," "state," or "sono" is appropriate for this particular sentence structure.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "ha" is the third person singular form of the verb "verificare," which agrees with its subject "he." Additionally, the past participle "verificata" agrees with its direct object "la firma" in gender and number.
1	The sentence "Riccardo lava la macchina." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. Here, the singular subject "Riccardo" matches with the third person singular verb form "lava". Additionally, the article "la" correctly agrees with the feminine gender of "macchina", which is also appropriate since "macchina" means car and refers to a vehicle that can be either masculine or feminine depending on its model but more commonly used as feminine.
1	The sentence "Paola ha visto la partita con gli amici." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper prepositions. Here, "Paola" (the subject) agrees with the verb "ha visto" (has seen), and "gli amici" are correctly used as an indirect object of the preposition "con" (with).
1	The sentence "Gabriele si è tagliato le basette." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian syntax and verb conjugations for past tense sentences with reflexive verbs. In this case, "si è" is the third person singular of the present perfect tense of the reflexive verb "tagliarsi," which agrees with the subject "Gabriele." Additionally, "le basette" refers to sideburns or short hair near the ears, making sense in context as something that can be cut.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "si è tagliato," which is correctly conjugated in the third person singular form for the compound past tense (passato prossimo) of the reflexive verb "tagliarsi." Additionally, the direct object "il mento" specifies what part of Riccardo was cut and follows standard Italian word order rules by appearing before the verb phrase.
1	The sentence "Francesco si è calmato, irrigidito." is grammatically correct. Both "calmato" and "irrigidito" are past participle forms that agree with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the subject "Francesco". Therefore, it is acceptable to use them together as shown in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Si è rotto il vetro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "si" serves as a reflexive pronoun that agrees with the plural noun "il vetro," while "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere" (to be), which also matches the gender and number of its subject. However, since "vetro" is a masculine noun, we would typically see "lo" instead of "il." Therefore, a more natural phrasing would be "Si è rotto lo vetro" or simply "Il vetro si è rotto." Nevertheless, the original sentence remains grammatically acceptable despite not being idiomatic.
0	The verbs "mangiate" and "bevute" are conjugated for the second person plural (you all) instead of the second person singular (tu). It should be "Vieni alla festa e mangia e bevi." if addressing one person or "Venite alla festa e mangiate e bevete." if addressing multiple people.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il dibattito è continuato" can be translated to "The debate has continued." In this case, the third person singular form of the verb "essere" (to be) should be used with "il dibattito," and it is indeed "è" instead of "sono". Therefore, I would label this as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Il dibattito ha continuato." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "il dibattito" (the debate) serves as the subject, which agrees with the third person singular verb form "ha continuato" (has continued). Additionally, the word order is Subject + Verb, which is standard for declarative sentences in Italian.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha cancellato la scritta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for past tense sentences in Italian. In this case, the subject (Riccardo) is followed by the auxiliary verb "ha" and then the past participle of the main verb "cancellato". This structure is commonly used to indicate that an action was completed in the past.
1	The sentence "Leonardo suona il telefono." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, "suona" is the third-person singular form of the verb "suonare," which agrees with the subject "Leonardo" in number (singular) and gender (masculine). Additionally, word order in Italian tends to follow a Subject + Verb + Object pattern, as demonstrated by the given sentence. Therefore, there are no apparent errors or violations that would warrant labeling this sentence as incorrect.
1	The sentence "Il livello si è alzato" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the past participle ("alzato") and the correct subject-verb agreement with "si." In this case, "si" serves as an impersonal reflexive pronoun that agrees in number with the implied subject (the level), which is singular.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha bruciato la torta." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.
1	The sentence "Edoardo è pentito" is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the verb "essere" (to be) which agrees with the singular subject "Edoardo".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the use of verb tense or agreement between subject and verb. "Il bosco" (the forest) as singular noun correctly uses the singular form of the past participle "si è bruciato."
1	The sentence "La biancheria si è asciugata per un'ora" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the past participle "asciugata" agrees with the subject "biancheria", and it indicates that the action of drying has been completed. Also, the time expression "per un'ora" correctly describes how long the action took to be accomplished. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "the book." Additionally, the use of tense and word order are consistent throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è ingrassato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for using the reflexive verb "ingrassare." In this case, "si" serves as both a direct and indirect object pronoun, agreeing with the singular subject "Riccardo," while the past participle "ingrassato" agrees in number and gender with the subject. Therefore, there are no errors or inconsistencies that would make the sentence unacceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be no changes made to it. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense. In this case, "ha" is used correctly as the third person singular of the verb "avere." Additionally, there are no apparent punctuation or word choice errors. Overall, the sentence appears well-constructed and understandable.
0	In the sentence "Si è rotta la televisione in un'ora," there is an agreement error between the singular subject ("la televisione") and the plural auxiliary verb used with it ("si è"). The correct form should be "È rotta la televisione in un'ora."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "la sala" agrees with the singular verb form "si è svuotata". Additionally, the adverb "in punto" correctly modifies the time expression "alle otto", and there are no other apparent errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "il treno" agrees with the singular verb "si è." Additionally, "un po'" functions as an adverb here and modifies the verb phrase "si è fermato," indicating that the train stopped briefly.
1	The sentence "The shirts that are on sale are all sizes" is grammatically correct. There is no error in this sentence. It consists of two independent clauses connected by the coordinating conjunction "and". Both clauses have the verb form "are", which agrees with their plural subjects ("shirts" and "all sizes").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("I") and a verb ("have noticed") that agrees in number with the subject, followed by an object ("a book fallen"). Additionally, the past participle "fallen" correctly describes the state or condition of the book after having been dropped.
1	The sentence "Alessandro conosce le strade" is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence, which is "Alessandro", agrees with the verb "conosce". In Italian, just like in English, present tense verbs change depending on whether the subject is singular or plural, and in this case, since the subject is singular (one person), the verb must be as well.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Andrea takes advantage of Maria" would be the literal translation to English. However, it's important to note that the phrase can have different connotations depending on cultural context and interpretation.
0	The sentence should be "Chi ama Leonardo?" or "Leonardo, chi lo ama?" instead of "Chi Leonardo ama?" because the subject and verb need to agree in number and order according to Italian grammar rules. In this case, we are asking who loves Leonardo, so the correct form is to put the pronoun "chi" before the name "Leonardo".
1	The sentence "Francesco sta andando al parco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "stare" (to be) must agree with its subject "Francesco." In this case, since "Francesco" is singular, we use the third person singular form of the verb "sta". Additionally, the preposition "al" before "parco" correctly indicates movement towards a destination.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, "Trenta chili" is plural and requires the verb "sono". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be "Trenta chili sono stati pesati da Alessandro."
1	The sentence "Mio nonno ha venduto il suo podere." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It should be noted that "two" is used correctly as it refers to the number of languages and not people; therefore, the plural form "are" is appropriate here.
1	The sentence "Otto ore al giorno sono studiate da Tommaso." is grammatically correct because the verb "sono" agrees with its subject "otto ore". In Italian, when the subject of a sentence consists of an amount or quantity followed by a noun, the verb must agree with the noun that follows the number (in this case, "ore"). So, since "ore" is plural, we use the third person plural form of the verb, which is "sono".
1	The sentence "Alessandro trivella questa cosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective roles in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Tommaso torna da Roma" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "Tommaso" is the subject, while "torna" (the third person singular form of the verb "tornare") agrees with the subject and serves as the predicate. Additionally, "da Roma" indicates where Tommaso is coming from, providing more context to the action. Overall, the structure and components of this sentence are consistent with standard Italian syntax and usage.
1	The sentence "Francesco macina il caffè in un vecchio macinino." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for both regular and irregular verbs ("macina" and "è," respectively). Additionally, all of the words are used correctly and agree with each other in terms of gender (masculine) and number (singular).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows standard Italian syntax rules. Additionally, there are no spelling errors or missing punctuation marks. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as acceptable in formal and informal written or spoken contexts.
1	The sentence "Dov'è che Riccardo ha posato la cassa sul mobile?" is grammatically correct. It features the required question word ("dov'è"), subject-verb agreement (the third person singular verb form "ha" agrees with its subject "Riccardo"), and uses appropriate prepositions and definite articles to indicate location.
1	The sentence "Lo scoglio affiora" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "lo scoglio," which means "the reef" or "the rock," serves as the subject of the sentence, while "affiora," meaning "emerges" or "surfaces," functions as the verb. This construction respects the number (singular) and gender (masculine) agreement between the subject and the verb. Furthermore, the word order adheres to SVO structure, where "S" stands for Subject ("lo scoglio"), "V" represents Verb ("affiora").
1	The sentence "Andrea si comporta." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "si comporta" agrees with its singular subject "Andrea".
0	The verb "sottrae" does not agree with its subject "Leonardo". In this case, the correct form of the verb should be "sottrae" because "Leonardo" is singular and masculine. However, the sentence implies that "la penna" is what is being taken away, so it would make more sense to say "Leonardo toglie la penna" (or "prende la penna da qualcuno/qualche cosa") instead of "sottrae."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo toglie dalla cassaforte il giornale." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word usage. Specifically, the subject (Lorenzo) agrees with the verb (toglie), and the direct object (il giornale) also correctly uses an article before the noun as expected in Italian.
1	The sentence "Alessandro legge un libro a letto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular present tense (leggere). In this case, "leggere" agrees with its subject "Alessandro". Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are used correctly, making the overall structure coherent and understandable.
1	The sentence "Riccardo beve il the in una tazzina di porcellana" is grammatically correct. However, it should be noted that "the" is typically lowercased unless it is at the beginning of a sentence or part of a title. So a more correct version would be "Riccardo beve il tea in una tazzina di porcellana."
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, "Andrea" is singular, so the sentence requires "has", not "have". A grammatically correct version would be: "Where has Andrea taken a cigarette?"
1	The sentence "Tommaso estrasse la pistola nel bar." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "estrasse," and both are in the singular form. Additionally, the article "la" correctly precedes the noun "pistola". Furthermore, the preposition "nel" followed by the definite article "il" and the noun "bar" is also grammatically correct. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ci mangia il riso" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "mangia" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo," and appears before its direct object "il riso." Additionally, the pronoun "ci" indicates that the indirect object is an implied "noi," which also agrees with the verb form used.
0	The verb "sostiene" should agree with its subject "Tommaso", so the correct form is " Egli (or Lui) sostiene la lastra". Alternatively, you can rephrase the sentence to avoid using a pronoun and it would be grammatically correct ("Tommaso sostiene la lastra").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "prese", and there are no obvious errors in word choice or syntax. Good job!
1	The sentence "Leonardo takes the book from the library room" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement between subject and verb ("Leonardo" is singular and "takes" is also singular). Additionally, all of the words are spelled correctly and punctuation is used appropriately.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mette le casse sul ripiano del montacarichi." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian syntax rules and all of its words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects.
1	The sentence "Dov'hai messo le foto di Francesco?" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and verb agreement. It uses the singular form of the verb "dove" which agrees with the subject pronoun "tu." Additionally, the preposition "di" is correctly used before the proper noun "Francesco."
1	The sentence "Tommaso toglie i soldi dal cassetto." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. Here are some details about the structure of this sentence: - Subject pronoun: Tommaso (third person singular masculine) - Verb: togliere (third person singular present tense) - Direct object: i soldi (plural noun with definite article) - Preposition: dal (indicating movement from something) - Indirect object: il cassetto (singular noun with definite article) Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La chiave" (the key) is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the singular verb form "sta". Therefore, this sentence can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "ha" agrees with the subject "Lorenzo", which is singular and masculine. Additionally, the phrase "dal giardino alla strada" functions as an adverbial of place, providing information about where the action described by the verb took place.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Francesco" (masculine singular) is the subject that performs the action of throwing, and it agrees with the verb "ha lanciato" (third person singular). Additionally, the prepositions are used correctly to indicate location changes from one place ("dal balcone") to another ("al giardino").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors and the word order is appropriate. In this case, "Leonardo" serves as the subject of the sentence, while "ha piantato" represents the verb in past tense. Additionally, both "giardino" and "garage" act as destination prepositional phrases for where the flowers were planted by Leonardo.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In the given example "Edoardo carica le casse sulla nave," there are no grammar mistakes found. It follows standard Italian language rules with proper verb conjugations and word usage.
1	The sentence "La scala poggia contro il muro" is grammatically correct because all the words are correctly conjugated and spelled, and the syntax of the sentence follows standard Italian rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes how the rioters imprisoned Gabriele in the dungeon of the fortress using past tense verbs (incarcerarono and was). This creates a clear image of an event that took place at a specific time in the past. Additionally, all subject-verb agreements are followed correctly throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence "Francesco chiuse Giulia nella stanza" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "chiuse" (closed) agrees with its singular subject "Francesco". Additionally, the word order and syntax are also correct.
0	The verb "chiudere" should agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, the subject is "il denaro", which is masculine singular. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use would be "ha chiuso". So, the grammatically correct sentence is: "Gabriele ha chiuso il denaro."
1	The sentence "Gabriele diede appoggio al libro" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the past tense of the verb "dare", which is "diede", has been used correctly to indicate that the action occurred in the past. Additionally, the noun "appoggio" agrees with the article "al" and matches the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the object it refers to ("libro").
1	The sentence "Alessandro diede appoggio alla diffusione del libro" is grammatically correct.

Additionally, all other elements within the sentence are also appropriately conjugated and structured.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo caricò il camion." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian verbs, where the singular masculine third person conjugation of the verb "carico" (to load) matches with the male singular noun "Lorenzo". Also, the tense used here indicates that this action was completed in the past.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the third-person singular form of the verb "deters" (deterge) which agrees with its subject "This milk". Additionally, it employs proper word order and includes all necessary components for a complete sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo stipò l'armadio con i vestiti." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "stipò" (the third person singular past tense form of the verb "stipare") agrees with its subject "Riccardo," while "con i vestiti" correctly shows what was put into the wardrobe.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the plural form "stanno" to agree with the subject "la fotografia di Giulia e quella di Lorenzo".
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" should match with the verb form used in the sentence. In this case, it would be "Riccardo allontanò Paola e la finestra da (or l'una dall'altra)". Also, there is no need for an article before "l'una", as it already includes one.
1	The sentence "Francesco avvolge la statua in una tela di lino" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows the rules of Italian syntax. In this sentence, we have the subject "Francesco", the verb "avvolge" (in the third person singular form), the direct object "la statua", and the prepositional phrase "in una tela di lino". This structure respects the standard word order for declarative sentences in Italian, which is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro accompanies Sofia to the cinema" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "accompanies" agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro". Additionally, all other elements of the sentence such as prepositions and objects are used correctly.
1	The sentence "Andrea accompanied Paola to school." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. The verb "accompanied" agrees with its singular subject "Andrea," and comes after the subject as expected. Additionally, the preposition "to" is correctly used before the noun phrase "school".
0	In this sentence, the verb "stanno" should agree with the subject "I libri," which is plural. However, it does not. The correct form of the verb to use here would be "stanno." Therefore, the grammatically correct version of this sentence would be "I libri non stanno nell'armadio."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. Additionally, the adjective "meno" correctly modifies the noun "pericolosa." Overall, this sentence describes an action performed by a singular subject ("Andrea") and uses appropriate language to convey its meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses the intention of dressing up as a bride.
1	The sentence "Francesco mangiava il pane con soddisfazione." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian verb conjugations for the subject "Francesco" and the past tense of the verb "mangiare". Additionally, the preposition "con" followed by the noun "soddisfazione" correctly expresses the idea that Francesco was eating bread with satisfaction.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the appropriate tense to indicate an action that happened in the past and it follows the standard structure of Italian sentences (subject + verb + object). In this case, "pioveva" is the verb in its imperfect form, which indicates ongoing or repeated actions in the past; "a dirotto", on the other hand, means "heavily" or "torrentially," providing more detail about how it was raining.
0	The verb "bere" must agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, the correct form for the third person singular (masculine) should be used instead of the infinitive form. A grammatically correct sentence would be: "Il vino **beve** Alessandro." or "Alessandro **bevono** il vino.", depending on whether you want to express that Alessandro drinks wine as an action he performs or if it is about his habitual consumption.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha telefonato e Maria è venuta." is grammatically correct because it uses proper conjugations for the past tense of both verbs and matches the subject-verb agreement rule. Here, "ha telefonato" (has called) corresponds to the masculine singular subject "Francesco," while "è venuta" (has come) agrees with the feminine singular subject "Maria." Both subjects are separated by the conjunction "e" (and), making this a simple compound sentence where each part has its own verb form that follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Quel libro è stato dato a Paola da Gabriele" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a passive voice sentence in Italian and all the words are used correctly with respect to their tense, number, gender and role in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Paola riceve quel libro da Riccardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, the subject "Paola" is singular and feminine, and the verb "riceve" agrees with the subject by being in the third person singular form (present tense). Additionally, the preposition "da" followed by a noun indicates the indirect object of the sentence, which is "Riccardo". Therefore, there are no apparent errors or violations of standard Italian language usage.
1	The sentence "Andrea mangia un polpo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated for the given tense and number.
1	The sentence "Tommaso mangia questo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the singular subject "Tommaso" correctly takes the third person singular present tense form of the verb "mangiare," which is "mangia".
1	The sentence "Sofia lo adora" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Sofia") and a verb ("adora"). In this case, "lo" is a direct object pronoun that refers to something or someone previously mentioned (e.g., "la pizza," "il suo cane," etc.). Additionally, the verb form "adora" agrees with the gender and number of its subject "Sofia." Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
0	The verb "ha" should agree with the subject "l'artrosi," which is singular. However, it appears as if there was an attempt to make the verb agree with "le ossa," which is plural. A grammatically correct sentence would require using the singular form of the verb that agrees with "l'artrosi." For example: "L'artrosi ha paralizzato un osso." (Arthritis has paralyzed a bone.)
0	The correct form of the third person singular present tense of the verb "to want" is "wants", not "vuele". Additionally, there should be an object pronoun "it" after the verb "mange". So the corrected sentence would be: "Maria wants to eat it."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ammira Alice." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and spelling.
1	The sentence "Riccardo la ammira." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in Italian and uses the appropriate form of the verb "ammirare" for the third person singular masculine subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the direct object pronoun "la" correctly refers to the feminine singular noun that precedes it in the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules with the subject "Edoardo" and the verb "mira".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "è" is the correct form of the verb to be because "Maria" is singular. Additionally, "sul letto" means "on the bed," so it implies that Maria jumps on top of the bed.
0	The correct form of the adverb "subito" should be used at the beginning of the sentence, which is "Subito", not "È subito". Also, there shouldn't be a space between "Edoardo" and "vuole". So, the corrected sentence would be: "Subito Edoardo vuole il caffè."
0	The correct form of the verb should be used to agree with the subject in number and person. In this sentence, "ci" is the subject, which requires the third-person singular form of the verb. Therefore, it should be "è", not "ci tiene". A grammatically correct version could be "Il successo è ciò che Tommaso desidera." (The success is what Thomas wants).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case "Leonardo" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "mira". Therefore, there should be no auxiliary verb "è", making the sentence grammatically correct as it stands.
1	The sentence "Riccardo adora il cinema." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper Italian vocabulary and syntax. Here, "adora" is the verb that agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo," and "il cinema" is the object of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "È" is the correct singular form of the verb "to be" to agree with the subject "il cinema".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be an article "il" before "cinema", but its absence doesn't make the sentence incorrect; it just changes the meaning slightly (it implies that "cinema" has been previously mentioned or is known from context).
1	The sentence "I denti di Emma battono dal freddo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word agreement. All the words are used correctly and there are no apparent errors that would make the sentence difficult to understand or incorrect.
0	The verb "adore" should agree with its subject "Alessandro," which is singular. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use here is "adores." Additionally, there are some issues with pronouns and articles that need to be corrected. A possible grammatically correct sentence could be: "Alessandro adora che le donne abbiano gambe lunghe." This translates to: "Alessandro loves it that women have long legs."
0	In this sentence, the subject "Andrea" is singular and requires the verb to be in its third person singular form "adore". However, the verb used here is "ne adora", which should be "ne adora" if it were referring to something that comes before it (e.g., "I like Emma's friends, but Andrea ne adora"). Therefore, without more context, I would consider this sentence grammatically incorrect.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mangia un gelato." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "mangia" (meaning "eats") agrees with its singular subject "Gabriele". Additionally, all words are properly conjugated and spelled correctly in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo promises to Riccardo that he will come" is grammatically correct. There are no obvious errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice, or sentence structure. However, it should be noted that the phrase "to Riccardo" might sound strange to native English speakers because we typically use first and last names interchangeably as both subjects and objects of sentences. So, depending on context, you could say either "Riccardo promised Riccardo that he would come" OR "Riccardo promised himself that he would come." But without more information about what's happening in this particular scenario, I can't definitively say which version is preferable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "il polpo" (the octopus) agrees with the singular verb form "è" (is). Also, there are no evident morphological or syntactical errors that would compromise the meaning of the sentence.
1	The sentence "La tolleranza ne esula dai suoi doveri" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the word "tolleranza" (tolerance) is the subject and it agrees with the verb "esula" (is outside of). Also, "ne" is used correctly as an adverb here to indicate that tolerance goes beyond its duties.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ci viene da Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. Here, "ci" is an indirect object pronoun that means "to us," while "viene" is the third person singular form of the verb "venire," which agrees with its subject "Riccardo." Additionally, "da Roma" indicates where Riccardo comes from. Therefore, this sentence is acceptable in formal and informal contexts without any modifications needed.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Andrea" is the one performing the action of thinking and it agrees with the verb "pensa". Also, the indirect object "Paola" has been correctly placed after the verb using the preposition "a", which is required for this construction.
1	The sentence "Sofia accompanies Maria in China" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. The verb "accompanies" agrees with its singular subject "Sofia," and appears before its object "Maria." Additionally, the preposition "in" correctly introduces the destination of the action.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the compound subject "Emma and the film" is plural, so the verb "si sono visti" agrees with it in number.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ammira la casa che è di Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. Here, "Alessandro" (subject) is singular and masculine, while "ammira" (verb) agrees with this subject by being conjugated in third person singular form. Additionally, the relative clause "che è di Paola" correctly uses the singular copula verb "è" to agree with its feminine singular subject "casa". Overall, there are no apparent errors or violations of standard Italian usage that would warrant labeling this as an incorrect sentence.
1	The sentence "Beatrice involuntarily absorbs Francesco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense (involuntarily is an adverb modifying the verb absorbs). Additionally, there are no apparent errors in agreement or usage of words.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo distribuisce mattoni" is grammatically correct but it changes the meaning of the original sentence. If you want to say that Lorenzo distributes bricks (more than one), then the correct form should be used.
0	The correct form of the verb "to be" should be used according to the subject. In this case, since "Riccardo" is singular, the sentence should use "è", not "sono". A grammatically correct version would be: "Che Riccardo dipinga è bello."
1	The sentence "Sofia walks through Venice." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense.
1	The sentence "Maria collects pebbles" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Maria") and a verb ("collects") in past tense, as well as an object ("pebbles"). Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled.
1	The sentence "Giulia legge" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. Here, the singular noun "Giulia" matches with the third person singular verb form "legge," which indicates that she is reading something.
1	The sentence "Beatrice schermisce with ability" is grammatically correct. There are no obvious errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice, or sentence structure. The verb "schermisce" agrees with its singular subject "Beatrice," and the meaning of the sentence is clear.
1	The sentence "Maria helps Alice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of the words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects.
1	The sentence "Emma humiliates Edoardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object), and both subject ("Emma") and verb ("humiliates") agree in number. In this case, the third person singular form of the verb ("humiliates") must be used since the subject ("Emma") is also singular. Therefore, there are no errors or issues with grammar in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Il fulmine cadde sulla testa di Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. The past tense verb form "cadde" agrees with its singular subject "il fulmine", and the preposition "su" followed by the article "la" correctly indicates that what comes next ("testa") is the thing being affected by the action of the verb. Additionally, the name "Andrea" appears at the end of the sentence in apposition to "testa". This structure emphasizes the identity of the person who was struck by the lightning bolt. Overall, this sentence demonstrates good command of standard Italian language usage.
1	The sentence "Fa neve" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure for weather expressions where the third person singular form of the verb (fa) is used with the subject "la neve".
1	The sentence "Alessandro dormicchia nell'inazione più totale" is grammatically correct. There are no errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The verb "dormicchia," which means to nap or doze off, agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro." Additionally, the prepositional phrase "nell'inazione più totale" correctly modifies the main clause. Therefore, this sentence can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La maionese non ha preso bene" can be translated as "The mayonnaise didn't turn out well." Both the subject-verb agreement and word choice are appropriate for this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "sorride" agrees with its plural subject "Maria and Giulia."
1	The sentence "Quel vestito non va ad Alice." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "quel vestito" (that dress) is singular and masculine, so the verb "va" (goes), which agrees with it, must also be singular and masculine. Additionally, the preposition "ad" followed by the definite article "al" is used correctly to indicate movement toward someone or something. Therefore, the sentence is acceptable as it stands.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Capital" can be used as an uncountable noun and does not require an article before it. Additionally, the verb "amounts" agrees with its subject "the capital."
1	The sentence "A star shines in the sky" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense to describe an action that occurs regularly ("shines"). The nouns are also used correctly with no agreement or number errors.
1	The sentence "A star shines in the sky" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for subject-verb agreement and uses proper vocabulary and tense.
1	The sentence "A star twinkles in the sky" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense for present continuous action (twinkles). Additionally, all of the words are correctly used and spelled, making this phrase acceptable as a complete thought in English.

1	The sentence "Beatrice arde dalla passione" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "Beatrice" is the subject, which is correctly conjugated to third person singular present tense "arde," agreeing with its subject in number and person. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "dalla passione" functions as an adverbial complement of cause, providing more information about the reason for Beatrice's passion. Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper word order and agreement between words, making it grammatically acceptable in Italian.
1	The sentence "Paola luccicava dall'emozione." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "luccicava" (past tense of "luccicare", which means to shine or sparkle) agrees with its subject "Paola" in number and gender, while "dall'emozione" correctly indicates the cause of her shining. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as acceptable in formal written and spoken contexts.

Additionally, "in casa" correctly comes after the verb as an adverbial phrase indicating where the action takes place.
1	The sentence "La scala scende in cantina" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows proper Italian syntax rules. In this case, "scenda" is the third person singular of the verb "scendere," which means to go down or descend, while "in cantina" refers to going into the basement or cellar. Therefore, the whole phrase can be translated as "The staircase goes down to the basement."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Ci" can be used as an indirect object pronoun to indicate the presence of a group that includes the speaker or writer (in this case, "we"). Therefore, the sentence means "The path leads to us," which is grammatically correct and idiomatic in Italian.
1	The sentence "La Maggioranza patteggia con l'Opposition." is grammatically correct because all of the words are correctly conjugated and there are no apparent errors in syntax or agreement. Additionally, this phrase follows standard Italian capitalization rules for nouns and proper names.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The verb "lotte" agrees with the singular subject "Emma", and it is correctly conjugated in the third person present tense. Additionally, all other elements in the sentence seem to form a coherent idea without any noticeable mistakes.
1	The sentence "Riccardo taglia il pane a fette" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses proper singular masculine definite article ("il") with the noun "pane". Also, the verb "tagliare" agrees with its singular male subject "Riccardo." Additionally, the phrase "a fette" correctly indicates that the bread is being cut into slices using the preposition "a".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "gli" is used as an indirect object pronoun (lo siento, I am assuming Italian) and it agrees with the masculine singular direct object pronoun "il". Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Il sarto ha confezionato un vestito di lino" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. Here, "il sarto" (the tailor) is the subject and "ha confezionato" (has made or has sewn) is the conjugated verb that agrees with the singular masculine noun. Additionally, "un vestito di lino" (a linen suit) is a correctly constructed direct object phrase, making this an acceptable and complete sentence in Italian.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha edificato una palazzina nel centro di Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. The subject-verb agreement is correct (Tommaso is singular, so we use "ha" which corresponds to third person singular), and the word order is also correct. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and there are no missing or extra elements that would make the sentence difficult to understand.
1	The sentence "Andrea is brutal with Alice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate prepositions.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an event that happened in the past when Japan (the subject) took control of Manchuria (the object).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense "had amassed" agrees with the subject "Leonardo," and the preposition "at" is used correctly before "the bottom of the library."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of the missing subject and verb agreement issue. A corrected version could be "Leonardo had leaned against the wall."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that "Lorenzo had stacked packages for us."
1	The sentence "L'avaro accumula ricchezze" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb form corresponds to the number and gender of the subject. In this case, the singular masculine noun "avaro" matches with the third person singular present tense verb "accumula".
1	The sentence "Leonardo is important to us." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "Leonardo".
0	The subject "il sergente" is singular, so the verb should also be singular. In this sentence, however, the plural form of the verb ("distribuono") is used instead of the singular form ("distribuisce"). Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.
1	The sentence "Sofia separated the work into two distinct parts." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. Here, the subject of the sentence is "Sofia," which is singular, so the verb must also be singular. In this case, the past tense verb "separated" agrees with the singular subject "Sofia." Additionally, the phrase "into two distinct parts" correctly modifies the object "work" by indicating how it was divided. Overall, the sentence has proper word order, clear meaning, and no obvious errors or awkward constructions.
1	The sentence "Paola gli carezzò il volto." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and agreement between words. In this case, "gli" is used as a direct object pronoun to replace the noun phrase "il suo viso", which refers to the face being touched by Paola. Additionally, "carezzò" agrees with the subject "Paola" in gender (feminine) and number (singular).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the possessive determiner "this" agrees with its plural noun "situation." Therefore, there should be no apostrophe after "this," and it does not imply possession but rather describes which situation is being referred to.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Maria" (feminine singular subject) agrees with the verb "afferrò" (third person feminine singular past tense of "afferrare", meaning "to grab"), and the direct object pronoun "la" correctly refers to "la mano". Additionally, the indirect object phrase "di Lorenzo" correctly follows the verb as it specifies who or what is affected by the action. Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper agreement between subjects, verbs, and objects, making it a grammatically correct statement in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense.
1	The sentence "Riccardo forgià l'acciaio" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb (in this case, "forgia") agrees with its singular subject ("Riccardo").
1	The sentence "Sofia cucina il pollo al limone." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the singular third person present tense form of the verb "cucinare" (to cook) agrees with its singular subject "Sofia". Additionally, the article "il" before "pollo" correctly indicates that "pollo" is masculine singular.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject it agrees with. In this case, "Le donne" is plural and requires the use of the third person plural form of the verb "partorire", which is "partoriscono". Therefore, the sentence "Le donne partoriscono i bambini" is grammatically incorrect because the singular form "parte" was used instead of the plural form "partoriscono".
1	The sentence "Paola converts sugar into candies" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. The subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "converts," which is in the third person singular form. Additionally, the preposition "into" correctly indicates the relationship between "sugar" and "candies." Overall, there are no apparent errors or awkward constructions that would make this sentence unacceptable in standard English.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject and verb do not agree. "Alice" is singular but "travestirono" is plural. It should be "trasse" to agree with the singular subject "Alice". A possible correction could be: "Alice lo trascinò via." (English translation: "Alice dragged him away.")
1	The sentence "Riccardo ne liberò il cane" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the simple past tense (passato prossimo) with the auxiliary verb "avere." In this case, "liberò" matches the masculine singular subject "Riccardo," indicating that he freed something or someone using the particle "ne" to introduce an indirect object pronoun. Since there is only one dog ("il cane") mentioned later in the sentence, we assume that "the dog" is what was released by Riccardo.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. However, the sentence might sound more natural with an article before "public administration". So it could be "The state grants too much trust to the public administration." Nonetheless, the original sentence without the definite article is also acceptable and understandable in English language contexts.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The sentence has a clear structure with a proper subject ("Tommaso") and predicate ("attributed the decision of going to China to Leonardo"). Additionally, there is an appropriate use of articles, prepositions, and verb forms. Overall, it meets all the requirements for standard English usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Leonardo"), an appropriate verb ("addebitava", past tense of "addebitare") that agrees with the subject, and a proper object ("la sua sfortuna"). The relative clause "della quale..." adds more information about the subject without altering the structure of the main clause.
1	The sentence "Francesco abbandona la moglie sulla strada." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and uses proper verb conjugations for each pronoun. In this case, "abbandona" agrees with its singular subject "Francesco". Additionally, all words are correctly spelled and there are no missing or extra components that would make the sentence difficult to understand.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word usage, or punctuation. This sentence describes an action (theft) performed by one group (thieves) on another group (legitimate owners). All the words used make sense and contribute to expressing this idea clearly.
1	The sentence "Maria spalmò il pane con il coltello." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper prepositions to indicate the relationship between words. Additionally, all of the nouns are correctly gendered and agree with their corresponding articles.
0	The verb "mise" is incorrect because the subject of the sentence "Riccardo" requires the use of an auxiliary verb followed by the past participle form of the verb "mettere", which should be "messo". Therefore, the correct form would be "Riccardo pose (or mette) il cappello sul tavolo."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes how the enemy's air force (la aviazione) dropped napalm bombs on a city.
0	The correct form of the verb "imbevere" should be used according to the subject-verb agreement rule. In this case, since the subject "Andrea" is singular, the third person singular form of the verb "imbeve" should be used instead of the infinitive form "imbeve". A possible grammatically correct sentence could be: "Andrea imbeve il pane nel vino."
1	The sentence "Raso rosso foderava i cuscini" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian language where singular subjects take a singular verb form and plural subjects take a plural verb form. Here, "raso rosso" (red satin) is the subject of the sentence and takes the third person singular verb form "foderava" which means "was upholstering". Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" agrees with the verb "dissemmina," and both are singular. Additionally, the word order is correct and all words are used appropriately to form a complete thought.
0	The verb "disseminate" is incorrectly used in this sentence. A more appropriate verb could be "scatter", which means to spread or distribute randomly. The corrected sentence would be: "The tourists scatter litter on the lawn."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. However, the meaning of the sentence could be clearer with additional context about what specifically Gabriele fed his son and how this relates to being "the most brilliant and intelligent of all."
1	The sentence "Riccardo liberò il cane dalle catene" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, the verb "liberò" (released) agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo," and the object "il cane" (the dog) comes before the prepositional phrase "dalle catene" (from the chains). Additionally, the past tense is used appropriately to describe a completed action.
1	The sentence "Alessandro scarica Giulia dalle proprie responsabilità" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and they form a coherent meaning that follows Italian syntax rules. In this case, the subject of the sentence (Alessandro) is performing an action on the object (Giulia), indicating that he is releasing or freeing her from some sort of responsibility.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ne ottiene la libertà" is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and the sentence structure follows standard Italian rules. In this case, there is no need for any changes or corrections.
1	The sentence "Gabriele difende Giulia contro i pericoli" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word usage. The subject Gabriele is correctly paired with the verb "difende," which agrees in number and person. Additionally, the preposition "contro" is appropriately used to indicate that Gabriele is defending someone (in this case, Giulia) from something (the dangers). Overall, there are no apparent errors or inconsistencies in the sentence structure, making it an acceptable sentence in Italian.
0	The verb "fare" should be conjugated as "fa" (third person singular) instead of "fanno" (third person plural). Additionally, the phrase "deriva dall'oro" is preferred over "derive dall'oro". So the grammatically correct sentence would be: "L'alchimista fa sì che l'oro derivi dal piombo."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("Riccardo"), an auxiliary verb ("spostò") and two complements ("il cappello" as the direct object and "dall'armadio al tavolo" as the indirect object). All words are used correctly according to their function in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Leonardo poses the book on the table." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. The subject of the sentence, "Leonardo," is singular and the verb "poses" agrees with it by being in third-person singular form. Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are arranged correctly to convey its meaning.
1	The sentence "Alessandro prese il cappotto dall'armadio." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word agreement. Here, "prese" (the third-person singular past tense form of the verb "prendere") agrees with its subject "Alessandro," while "il cappotto" (masculine singular definite article plus noun) matches the masculine singular adjective "dall'armadio." Overall, there are no apparent errors or inconsistencies that would make this sentence grammatically incorrect.
1	The sentence "Gabriele spedì la ricevuta all'ufficio delle imposte." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb conjugations for the third person singular (spedì). Additionally, it has appropriate use of articles and prepositions.
1	The sentence "Paola spinse le gambe di Francesco verso la parete." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for word order and verb agreement in Italian. In this case, "Paola" (the subject) comes before the verb "spinse," which agrees with the singular form of "Paola." Additionally, "le gambe di Francesco" are correctly marked as plural objects of the sentence. Finally, the preposition "verso" introduces the destination or direction of the action, followed by the noun phrase "la parete." Therefore, there are no obvious errors that would warrant labeling this sentence as incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La Foresteria" is the subject of the sentence and it is correctly followed by the verb "ospita". Then we have the plural noun "gli interventi", which agrees with the plural form of the past participle "alla manifestazione".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are used correctly and agree with each other in terms of number and tense. "Il dottore" (the doctor) is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "spennella" (paints). "Le tonssille" (the tonsils) belongs to Gabriele and therefore we use "le", which is the plural feminine form for direct object pronouns. Also, "di Gabriele" is necessary to indicate whose tonsils are being painted.
1	The sentence "Leonardo archived the documentation in the central archive." is grammatically correct as it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement or word usage. The verb "poggiano" agrees with its plural subject "gomiti," and the preposition "sul" correctly indicates that the elbows are resting on top of the windowsill.
1	The sentence "Riccardo drowns his sorrows in wine." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense. Additionally, all of the words are correctly used and spelled.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense and punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense for past actions. Also, the prepositions are used correctly to indicate movement of an object from one place to another.
1	The sentence "Tommaso pompava l'acqua dal lago alla piscina." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the third person singular past tense of the verb "pompava". Additionally, the prepositions "dal" (from) and "alla" (to) are correctly used to indicate movement from one location to another. Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper usage of Italian grammar.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject "Alessandro and Leonardo" who are negotiating something (the object), which is "the freedom of Maria". Both the subject-verb agreement and word order are correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word usage, or syntax.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ricava danaro dalle sue applicazioni." is grammatically correct because all the words are correctly conjugated and spelled, and the syntax follows standard Italian rules.
1	The sentence "Riccardo allontana Maria dalla stanza." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations for each subject. In this case, "allontana" is the third person singular form of the verb "allontanare", which agrees with its subject "Riccardo". Similarly, there are no errors in word order or usage.
1	The sentence "Leonardo counts on Francesco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in the use of tense, agreement, word choice or syntax. Therefore, I would label this sentence as correct with a response of 1.
1	The sentence "Tommaso fondueva l'argento con l'oro" is grammatically correct. The verb form "fondueva" agrees with the subject "Tommaso" and it expresses past tense correctly. Additionally, all words are used appropriately to convey the intended meaning of Tommaso melting silver with gold.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ci sostituisce il tubo catodico." is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Riccardo le sostitusice il tubo catodico" is grammatically correct if we assume that "le" refers to an object and not a pronoun. However, the gender of the object is not clear from this sentence alone, so it could potentially be incorrect depending on context. A more complete sentence would help clarify whether or not the use of "le" as a direct object pronoun for a singular feminine noun (such as "la televisione") is appropriate. Nonetheless, without additional information, I will label this sentence as grammatically correct since there are no obvious errors within it.
1	The sentence "Tommaso alterna Beatrice con Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. The subject of the sentence, "Tommaso," agrees with the verb "alterna" (third person singular), and the direct object "Beatrice" is correctly separated from the indirect object "Paola" by the preposition "con". Additionally, all words are properly conjugated for tense and number.
1	The sentence "L'amore lega" is grammatically correct because the verb "lega" agrees with its subject "l'amore." In Italian, just like in English, the form of the verb changes depending on whether the subject is singular or plural and also based on person (first, second, third). Here, since "l'amore" is singular and third-person, we use "lega," which is indeed the right choice.
1	The sentence "Gabriele dorme" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "dormire" (to sleep) agrees with its singular subject "Gabriele." In this case, the third person singular form of the verb "dorme" matches the number and gender of the subject.
1	The sentence "Maria wants a book." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement between the subject and its corresponding verb.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria desires that you come" or "Maria wishes for you to come" are possible alternative ways of expressing the same idea with similar levels of formality.
1	The sentence "Leonardo holds the possibility that they promote him." is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, or word usage.
1	The sentence "Giulia abbandona l'idea che vedrà Edoardo" is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are used appropriately and it follows Italian syntax rules. In particular, the verb "vedrà" agrees with the subject "Edoardo", which is singular and third person (masculine), so there is no grammar mistake here.
1	The sentence "Maria made the statement that Francesco is beautiful" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Maria"), a verb ("made") and an object ("the statement"). Additionally, the relative clause "that Francesco is beautiful" correctly uses the singular form of the third person present tense of the verb "to be", which agrees with the singular noun "Francesco".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. "Maria" is the subject and takes the verb "bada". The subjunctive form of the verb ("funzioni") is used correctly to express doubt, uncertainty or expectation about the action.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Edoardo" is the subject and "approva" is the verb that agrees with it (third person singular of the present tense). The subordinate clause "che Maria parta" follows the normal rules for Italian subjunctive mood after a main clause expressing approval or disapproval.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "that" should agree with the subject "Alice", so it should be "parts" instead of "part". Also, there should not be a space before the opening quotation mark. A grammatically correct sentence would be: "Emma doubts that Alice parts."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Che" does not make sense and it should be replaced with a proper word or phrase to express the intended meaning. Also, there seems to be missing information about what causes Tommaso's anguish regarding Lorenzo's travel.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject ("Riccardo") and the verb ("approva") do not agree in number. It should be "Riccardo approva questa idea". Also, the word "ciò" at the end of the sentence does not make sense without additional context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Edoardo" is the subject who approves, and "il fatto che Maria canti" is a subordinate clause that serves as the direct object of the verb "approva".
0	The verb "desideri" should be conjugated to match the subject "tu," which requires that it changes to "desideri" instead of "desiri." Additionally, there is no need for an object pronoun before the infinitive verb "venire" because it already follows the indirect object "Sofia." Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be: "Tu desideri che Sofia venga."
0	The verb "va" (goes) should agree with the subject "Riccardo", which is singular. However, "al fumo" means "to smoke," so it seems like there may be some confusion between going to a place and doing an action. A more grammatically correct way of expressing this idea would be "Riccardo fuma." or "Riccardo va a fumare.", depending on what exactly is meant by the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Alice" is the subject and the verb "brama" agrees with it in number (singular) and person (third). Additionally, "di tornare" functions as an infinitive phrase acting as the direct object of the sentence.
0	The correct form of the verb "to encourage" should be used in this sentence. A grammatically correct version would be "Andrea encourages Maria to get married."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "allevia" agrees with its subject "il fatto che Emma parli", and the word order is also appropriate for an Italian declarative sentence.
1	The sentence "Andare al cinema infiamma Sofia" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject ("andare al cinema") agrees with the verb ("infiamma") and the object ("Sofia"). Therefore, there are no errors regarding number or agreement between words.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("La colpisce") and a verb that agrees with it in number and person ("Riccardo rida" - third person singular).
1	The sentence "Mi meraviglia il fatto che Beatrice sia svestita." is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "essere" ("è" or "sono") according to the subject-verb agreement rule. In this case, since "Beatrice" is singular, we use "è", which correctly agrees with its subject.
0	The subject "Leonardo" is repeated twice with different roles (one as the subject of the first clause and another as the object of the second clause), leading to confusion and lack of clarity. It would be better to rephrase it using a pronoun or another noun to clearly distinguish between the two roles. For example: "Leonardo allieta Mario perché quest'ultimo ride."
1	The sentence "La tristezza e la noia deprimono Gabriele" is grammatically correct because the subjects ("la tristezza" and "la noia") agree with the verb ("deprimono") in number (plural) and person (third). Also, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Mi" is a reflexive pronoun used as the direct object of the verb "acquieta," and it agrees with the subject "Io." The subjunctive form "parli" is appropriately used since this clause expresses doubt or uncertainty about whether Julia talks that way or not.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the third-person singular form of the verb "acquiets" to agree with its subject "the sole presence", and "Alice". This structure creates an interesting contrast between the abstract concept ("solitude") and the specific example ("Alice").
1	The sentence "Parlare con le ballerine è divertente." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Io"), verb ("parlare") and object ("le ballerine"). Additionally, the use of present tense with the third person plural form of the verb agrees with the subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The use of the present continuous tense "I am coming" correctly conveys an action that is currently happening (the speaker being fascinated), and it agrees with the subject "Io". Additionally, "Edoardo talks about poetry" is also grammatically correct as the third person singular form "talks" matches the subject "Edoardo", and the preposition "of" preceding "poetry" is appropriate to indicate what Edoardo is talking about.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the phrase "di vedere i marziani" is incorrectly structured and should be rephrased for clarity and proper syntax. A possible correction could be: "Paola claimed to have seen martians."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the past participle "having won" (which needs to be paired with an auxiliary verb) is used as an adjective to describe the subject ("he"). This usage is acceptable and does not require an accompanying auxiliary verb.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper verb-subject agreement. "Di" cannot be used as the subject of the sentence; instead, there should be a noun or pronoun that agrees with the third person singular verb "splendeva". A possible correction could be: "The joy of having won the lottery shone in her gaze."
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, "Si tratta" is singular and requires "è", not plural "dobbiamo". A grammatically correct sentence would be "È che dobbiamo fuggire."
0	The verb "si tratta" should be conjugated as "è" instead of the plural form "sono". Also, there is missing agreement between the subject and the verb; it should be "si tratta *di una* fuga", since "fuga" is feminine singular. So, a correct version would be: "È una fuga." or "Si tratta di una fuga."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. It follows the standard structure of an indicative sentence with a subject ("Il fatto che Emma sia uscita così presto") and a predicate ("denota che in questo momento non va d'accordo con te"). Additionally, the verb "essere" agrees with its singular subject "Emma".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "condanno" is the first person singular of the Italian verb "condannare", meaning "to condemn". Therefore, it requires the subject to be in third person (Erode), and not in second or third plural form as the English translation might suggest.
1	The sentence "Gabriele adora carezzare Andrea" is grammatically correct because all the words are correctly conjugated and used in their proper form according to their role in the sentence. In this case, we have the subject "Gabriele", followed by the verb "adora" and its direct object "carezzare Andrea".
1	The sentence "Andrea intends to marry Alice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for forming sentences (subject + verb + object). In this case, "Andrea" is the subject, "intends" is the verb, and "to marry Alice" is the object of the sentence. Additionally, each word is correctly conjugated and spelled.
1	The sentence "Riccardo avoids watching television" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. Here, the subject "Riccardo" is singular, so the verb "avoids" should be used instead of its plural form "avoid". However, since the original sentence already uses the correct form of the verb, I assume that there was a mistake when typing the question, which initially stated "Riccardo avoid watch the television." In this corrected version, using "watches" would also be acceptable but might imply a different meaning (habitual action).
0	The verb "partire" should agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is "si", which requires the third person singular form of the verb, so it should be "parte". Therefore, the correct sentence would be: "Paola ritiene che si parte sia carino."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo thought Alice was Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with the number and person of its subject. In this case, the singular third-person verb "was" agrees with its plural antecedent "Alice and Paola."
0	The verb "giudicare" requires the use of the subjunctive mood after expressions like "che", so it should be "Beatrice lo giudichi che Maria abbia troppi amanti". Additionally, there is no need for the indirect object pronoun "lo" since "Beatrice" is already mentioned as the subject. A correct version could be: "Beatrice giudica che Maria abbia troppi amanti."
0	The verb "giudicare" requires the use of accusative case for its direct object and subjunctive mood when referring to an uncertain event or situation. In this sentence, "Maria" should be in the accusative form ("Marian") and "abbia" is needed instead of "ha". Also, there could be some confusion with the word "amanti", which usually means "lovers" but here it seems to imply something negative without proper context. A grammatically correct version of this sentence might be: "Sofia lo giudica una pazzia che Maria abbia così tanti amici." (meaning: "Sophia judges it as crazy that Maria has so many friends.")
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "lo" is a direct object pronoun that refers to something mentioned earlier in the conversation or context. In this case, it likely refers to someone or something whose beauty Julius has already commented on. So, the complete translation of the sentence would be: "Julius clearly judges that Maria is beautiful."
1	The sentence "Leonardo lo suppone che il padre beva troppo" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows proper Italian syntax rules. It means "Leonardo assumes that his father drinks too much".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "qualcosa" (something) refers to an idea or thought, so it makes sense to say "I think something of you." This means that the speaker has some sort of opinion or impression about the person being addressed.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. However, the use of "Io" at the beginning of the sentence can be seen as redundant and informal since it is clear that the speaker is referring to themselves without having to explicitly state so. A more formal version could simply say "Di te, penso che ami il tartufo."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that someone named Emma receives something from you. Both the subject ("Emma") and the verb ("ottene") agree in number (singular) and person (third). Additionally, there are no apparent missing or extra words, making it a complete and coherent statement.
0	The verb "lavorare" should agree with the subject and take the third person singular form ("lavora") instead of the second person plural form ("lavorate"). Additionally, there is no preposition indicating what kind of work Alice does towards Maria (e.g., helping, hindering). A grammatically correct sentence could be: "Alice aiuta Maria a catturare il criminale."
1	The sentence "Riccardo plaude al fatto che Tommaso ha vinto" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb forms for each subject. In this case, "Riccardardo" (subject) agrees with "plaude" (verb), while "Tommaso" (subject within the subordinate clause "che Tommaso ha vinto") also matches its own corresponding verb form "ha vinto". Both subjects are using appropriate verbs based on their number (singular or plural).
1	The sentence "Maria ci attira" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "ci" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to the individuals being attracted by Maria, while "attira" is the third-person singular conjugation of the verb "attrarre." Therefore, this sentence can be translated as "Maria attracts us," which is also grammatically correct in English.
1	The sentence "Maria ci si aggrappa" is grammatically correct. Here, "ci" is an Italian indirect object pronoun that means "to us", and it refers to the people who are being clung to. So, this sentence can be translated as "Maria clings to us".
1	The sentence "Paola aims to make the future happy" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules and all of its components are used properly according to their functions. In this case, we have a subject ("Paola"), an auxiliary verb that helps expressing the intention or desire of the action by the subject ("aims"), an infinitive verb form indicating what she wants to achieve ("to make") and the object of her aim ("the future"). Additionally, adjectives like "happy", when they come after the noun as in our example, must agree with such noun in number (singular) and gender (masculine if applicable). Since "future" is singular and masculine, "happy" being also singular agrees well with it.
1	The sentence "Giulia guardava il muro." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian independent clause with a subject ("Giulia") and a verb in the past tense ("guardava"). Additionally, the article used before "muro" agrees with its singular form.
0	The verb "pensa" should agree with its subject "Riccardo", so the correct form would be "pensa" instead of "pensano". Additionally, there should not be a comma before "Tommaso" because it is not an independent clause. Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence should be: "Riccardo pensa Tommaso."
0	The correct form of the verb to agree with "Paola" should be used. Also, there is an incorrect use of the reflexive pronoun and the conjugated form of the verb. A possible grammatically correct sentence could be: "Paola accetta di essere legata".
0	The verb "sorriderè" should be used instead of "sorride". In this case, the subject ("Alice") is singular and therefore requires a singular form of the verb. Additionally, it is not common to express pleasure about having cried, so the sentence might sound odd even if grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and has no apparent errors.
0	The phrase "Da quest'analisi risulta il nostro partire" is not grammatically correct because it uses the preposition "da" with the genitive form of the noun "analisi", which is incorrect; instead, you should use the preposition "di" or simply say "Quest'analisi risulta nel nostro partire".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "La tosse" and a dependent clause "dal fatto di aver fumato troppo", which explains the cause of coughing.
0	The verb "chiarire" should agree with its subject "Leonardo", so the correct form would be "Leonardo chiara". Additionally, there is no need for an indirect object pronoun like "gli" before "che". A grammatically correct version of this sentence could be: "Leonardo chiarisce che non è colpa sua a Paola." (meaning "Leonardo clarifies that it's not his fault towards Paola.")
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Andrea" (being the subject) is using a whistle to communicate to "Maria" that he or she is hungry.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and they follow the rules of English syntax. "Andrea" as a subject agrees with the verb "accennerà", which is conjugated correctly for third person singular. Additionally, the conditional clause "if he leaves or not" provides necessary context to complete the meaning of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Paola"), an appropriate verb that agrees with the subject ("addebita"), and a proper object of the preposition "that" which refers to the reason for the accusation ("the fact that now he is hungry").
1	The sentence "Riccardo lo aggiunge nel suo discorso" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular (he) with the present tense of the verb "aggiungere" which is "aggiunge". Also, the use of direct object pronoun "lo" before the verb is appropriate as well as its placement after the subject but before the verb. Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in it. "Maria has bet on us" can be considered as an acceptable translation of the given Italian phrase.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although there are two plural subjects ("giornalisti" and "politici"), the verb "attaccano" agrees with the closer subject which is "giornalisti". However, it would be more clear to rephrase the sentence using a singular subject or separating both clauses with a semicolon (or a period). For example: "I giornalisti attaccano sui quotidiani; molti politici, infatti, sono corrotti."
1	The sentence "Paola encourages the fact that boys go to the sea" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules and has proper verb agreement. Here, "go" agrees with its subject "boys," which is plural. Additionally, the phrase "the fact that boys go to the sea" functions as the direct object of the sentence, indicating what or whom Paola is encouraging. Overall, the sentence communicates a clear idea without any apparent errors in grammar or usage.
1	The sentence "Emma ne avvisa Alessandro." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian and uses proper endings to indicate direct object pronouns (ne).
1	The sentence "Gabriele lo convince che lo sciopero è giusto" is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are used correctly and it follows the standard structure for an Italian sentence (subject-verb-object). In this case, the subject is "Gabriele," the verb is "conclude," and the object is "lo sciopero." Additionally, the verbs agree with their subjects in number and gender.
0	The verb "esimere" requires the use of reflexive pronouns in Italian, and it should agree with the subject. In this sentence, since the subject is "Riccardo", the correct reflexive pronoun to use would be "si". Therefore, the sentence should read as follows: "Riccardo s'esime dal viaggio."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no apparent error in the word choice, verb agreement, or syntax of this sentence. "Il sindaco" (the mayor) agrees with the plural noun "i poveri" (the poor), and the third person singular form "esenta" (exempts) matches the subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria agrees with Leonardo so that the program is carried out" would be an accurate translation into English. It uses the singular form of the verb "to be" after "so that," which is appropriate when referring to a single action or state (in this case, "the program...is realized").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject of the sentence "Maria" agrees with the verb "si accorge", and the subordinate clause "di essere innamorata dal fatto di arrossire" provides additional information about what Maria realizes.
1	The sentence "Edoardo continua a mangiarlo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in Italian. Here, "Edoardo" (the subject) agrees with the verb form "continua", which is in third person singular. Additionally, the adverb "continua" comes before the main verb "mangiarlo," following the standard SOV structure in subordinate clauses in Italian.
1	The sentence "Leonardo lo indugia a mangiare" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and the sentence follows proper Italian syntax rules. In this case, "lo" is a direct object pronoun that refers to something or someone previously mentioned (in this context, it likely refers to food), while "indugia" means to delay or postpone, often with an implication of wasting time. Therefore, the overall meaning of the sentence is that Leonardo delays eating or procrastinates about starting to eat.
1	The sentence "Edoardo osa mangiare" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "osa" is the third person singular indicative present tense form of the verb "osare", which means "to dare". Similarly, "mangiare" is the infinitive form of the verb "mangiare", meaning "to eat". Together with the subject "Edoardo", they create a complete and coherent sentence that conveys an action performed by the subject.
1	The sentence "Paola è capace di cavalcare" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "è" (is) agrees with its singular subject "Paola". Additionally, the verb tense and mood are appropriate for the intended meaning of the sentence, which implies that Paola has the ability to ride horses.
1	The sentence "Maria has the intention to ride." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement and word usage rules. The subject of the sentence, "Maria," is singular, so the verb must also be singular, which it is ("has"). Additionally, all words are used correctly according to their intended meanings.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "suole" (which means "is used to") should agree with its subject "Tommaso", which is singular and masculine. However, in this case it is incorrectly conjugated in third person plural ("suolono"). A correct version of the sentence would be: "Tommaso suole il pasto."
1	The sentence "Riccardo deve mangiarlo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and an infinitive verb phrase ("deve mangiarlo"). Additionally, the pronoun "lo" correctly refers to a masculine singular direct object, which agrees with the past participle form of the verb "mangiare".
0	The correct form of the verb should be used based on the subject-verb agreement rule. In this case, "Gabriele" is singular and requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb. Therefore, "mange" (instead of "mangiarlo") should have been used to match with the subject "Gabriele".
1	The sentence "Riccardo va in camera." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper prepositions in Italian. Here, "Riccardo" (the subject) agrees with the third person singular verb form "va," which means "goes." Additionally, "in camera" is a common way to say "to his room" or "into the bedroom" in Italian.
1	The sentence "Andrea sale in camera" is grammatically correct because the verb "sale" agrees with its subject "Andrea". In Italian, verbs must change form depending on whether they are used with singular or plural subjects and also according to their tense. Here, since "Andrea" is singular and we are describing an action that happens now (present tense), the verb should be "sale", which indeed matches our example perfectly!
1	The sentence "Riccardo sparisce da Parigi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular present tense ("sparisce"). Additionally, all words are correctly spelled and agree with each other in gender and number.
1	The sentence "Edoardo parte a Parigi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian verbs. In this case, the singular third person present tense form of the verb "partire" (to leave) agrees with its singular subject "Edoardo". Additionally, the preposition used before city names like Paris should be "a", not "in".
1	The sentence "Paola sgambetta verso il ponte." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. Here, we have the subject ("Paola"), followed by the verb ("sgambetta") in third person singular form (which agrees with the subject), and then the preposition "verso" and its complement "il ponte". All words are correctly conjugated, and there are no apparent errors or typos.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A crowd can be referred to with a singular pronoun like "lo" if the meaning implies that it consists of multiple individuals acting as a single unit.
1	The sentence "Tommaso invia Emma in piazza" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper Italian verb conjugations for the third person singular (Tommaso) and third person singular feminine (Emma). Additionally, the preposition "in" followed by the noun "piazza" correctly indicates where Emma is being sent.
1	The sentence "Beatrice assembles a computer" is grammatically correct because the subject "Beatrice" agrees with the verb "assembles". In English, third-person singular present tense verbs require an -(e)s or -ies suffix when the subject is he, she, or it (in this case, the subject is "Beatrice").
1	The sentence "The film is by Scorsese." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with the number and person of its subject. In this case, the singular third-person subject "film" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb form "is". Additionally, the preposition "by" is used correctly to indicate the creator or author of the film.
1	The sentence "Paola lavora." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for stating that someone performs an action in Italian. In this case, "Paola" is the subject and "lavora" is the verb, which means "works". Since there are no errors or inconsistencies with regards to tense, agreement, or word choice, I would label this as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be no changes made to it. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order rules of English language. Additionally, all the words are used appropriately within their context. Good job!
0	The subject "molte" is already plural and should be followed by a singular verb. Additionally, there are two pronouns "loro" and the possessive adjective "leggono," which refers to the same group of people as the subject. This repetition is redundant and unnecessary. A better way to phrase this would be "Molti leggono il giornale."
0	The verb "were" should be used instead of the verb "was". Also, there is no need for an article before the word "architect", so the correct form would be: "Some museums were designed by architect."
1	The sentence "Paola mangia la pizza." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian and uses the correct singular form of the verb "mangiare" (to eat) that agrees with the singular subject "Paola".
0	The correct form should be "Quell'architetto ha progettato alcuni musei" instead of "Quell'architetto hanno alcuni progettati musei".
0	The verb "hanno" should agree with the subject "molte ragazze," so it should be in plural form. Also, there should not be a comma before the conjunction "e." A correct version of this sentence would be: "Molte ragazze hanno letto il giornale l'anno scorso."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and the word "tocchino" agrees with its singular subject "le spalle di Riccardo." Additionally, every other aspect of the sentence appears to be syntactically sound.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "will be touched" agrees with it in number (singular) and person (third). Additionally, the word "that" can be used instead of "by" when referring to something being affected by a movie or other piece of media. However, using "by" here is also acceptable even if less common.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "you", which is second person singular. Therefore, it should be "You are" instead of "Be". Also, there seems to be a missing word after "partita" for the sentence to make sense. A possible correction could be: "That you are leaving cheers up Beatrice."
1	The sentence "Gabriele is the husband of Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and has a clear subject ("Gabriele") and verb ("is"). Additionally, the possessive form "of" correctly connects the noun phrases "the husband" and "Paola".
1	The sentence "Beatrice is with Lorenzo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence and uses the appropriate singular form of the verb "to be." Additionally, the use of present tense indicates that this action or state is currently happening.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no need for any corrections. A possible nitpick might be to change "che è" to "her brother's", but that doesn't make the original version incorrect.
0	The sentence "Tommaso obeys of Maria" is not grammatically correct because the preposition "of" should be replaced with the possessive form "Maria's". Additionally, there seems to be some missing information or context as to what Tommaso is obeying that belongs to Maria. A possible correction could be "Tommaso obeys Maria's instructions."
0	The sentence "Andrea confronta Leonardo con Andrea" is not grammatically correct because the preposition "con" (which means "with") should be followed by the objective form of the pronoun. In this case, it should be "lo", which is the masculine singular object pronoun that corresponds to "Leonardo". Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be "Andrea confronta Leonardo con lo."
1	The sentence "Maria fotografa Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian language, where the verb form changes depending on the number and gender of the subject. In this case, "fotografa" agrees with the feminine singular subject "Maria".
1	The sentence "Lorenzo was eager" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo"), a linking verb ("was"), and an adjective describing the subject ("eager").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "sorella" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "guarda". Since "tua sorella" is singular, we use the third person singular form of the verb "guardare", which is "guarda".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "tua sorella" agrees with the singular verb form "guarda". This indicates that only one person (your sister) is watching something (the CD).
1	The sentence "Sofia has cut off the head of the bison" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. The subject "Sofia" is singular, so we use the third-person singular form of the verb "has cut," which is "has." Additionally, the word order and overall structure of the sentence are clear and logical.
0	The verb "hanno" should be replaced with the singular form "ha", since the subject of the sentence is "Sofia" and not multiple subjects. Additionally, it would be more appropriate to use a less violent phrase such as "Sofia has interacted with the bulls."
1	The sentence "I ragazzi taglierebbero la corda" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct conjugated form of the verb "tagliare" for third person plural subject ("ragazzi") in conditional tense ("taglierebbero"). Also, the preposition "di" before "corda" agrees with the feminine singular noun. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as grammatically acceptable in Italian language.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. Therefore, it can be classified as acceptable from a grammatical perspective. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine the meaning or appropriateness of the sentence in a specific communicative situation.
1	The sentence "Maria stende il bucato." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb (stende) agrees with its singular subject (Maria). Additionally, the definite article "il" preceding "bucato" correctly indicates that we are referring to a specific laundry load being hung up to dry.
1	The sentence "Il mio cane abbaia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. Here, the subject "mio cane" (my dog) is singular, so we use the third person singular form of the verb "abbaia" (barks).
1	The sentence "Riccardo ulula" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees with the number and gender of its subject. In this case, the singular masculine noun "Riccardo" requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "ululare," which is "ulula." Therefore, the sentence correctly states that Riccardo howls or bays.
1	The sentence "Gabriele dormì" is grammatically correct because it follows the proper conjugation of the Italian verb "dormire" (to sleep) in the past tense for male singular subjects. In this case, "dormì" is the first person singular simple past form ("I slept").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate singular form "si" instead of the plural "sono." Also, the phrase "in un battibaleno," which means "in a flash" or "in an instant," is used correctly here to indicate that the dog stopped very quickly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word usage or punctuation. All the elements of a complete sentence (subject, predicate and object) are present. Good job!
1	The sentence "Leonardo has sectioned the old elm" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement between the subject ("Leonardo") and auxiliary verb ("has"). Additionally, all of the words are spelled correctly and there are no missing or extra punctuation marks.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the use of verb tense or agreement, word choice, or sentence structure. "Le sei bombe" is a plural noun and "sono esplose" is the appropriate third person plural form of the past tense verb "esplodere". Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo no longer has the habit of smoking." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. The subject "Lorenzo" agrees with the verb "has," which is in the third person singular form. Additionally, the phrase "the habit of smoking" is correctly constructed as a gerund followed by a preposition and a noun.
1	The sentence "Andrea is becoming handy" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with its singular or plural subject in number and person. In this case, the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "to be," which is "is", agrees with its singular subject "Andrea". Additionally, the adjective "handy" correctly describes the noun "Andrea."
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha fatto gli auguri a Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for expressing an action performed by a subject (in this case, "Tommaso") towards an object or indirect object ("gli auguri" and "Giulia," respectively) using the appropriate tense of the verb. In Italian, when the direct object is preceded by the definite article, as in this case with "gli" before "auguri", we must use the third person singular form of the past participle, which is "ha fatto". Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Sofia chiede che tu torni immediatamente." is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are correctly used and combined together to convey a complete thought. In this case, we have an independent clause ("tu torni immediatately") that serves as the direct object of the verb "chiede" in the main clause ("Sofia chiede"). Additionally, the use of subjunctive mood in Italian for verbs following expressions of request or demand (such as "che + tu torni") is also appropriate here. Therefore, there is no grammar mistake in this sentence.
0	The verb "dispiacere" requires the indirect object pronoun "le" instead of "a" before Beatrice. Also, it should agree with its subject (you), so the correct form is "ti". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be: "Che tu te ne vada dispiace a Beatrice."
1	The sentence "I bambini hanno calpestato le aiuole." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, "bambini" (children) is the subject, which agrees with the plural form of the auxiliary verb "hanno" (have). Additionally, "aiuole" (flower beds) correctly takes on the plural form to agree with the number of objects being acted upon by the verbs "calpestare" (to trample). Therefore, there are no apparent errors in this sentence that would warrant labeling it as incorrect or unacceptable in standard Italian usage.
0	The verb "eruttare" (to erupt) should be used with inanimate objects or entities that can produce an eruption such as volcanoes, not with people or animals like children. Therefore, the sentence is not grammatically correct because it uses "eruttare" with "bambini".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, or word usage. The sentence describes one event where an action was performed by one person on one witness and this occurred one month ago.
0	The verb "ha" should be changed to the third person singular form "has". Additionally, there is a missing object of the verb "photographed", so the correct sentence would be "That man has photographed it."
0	The verb "ha" should match the subject "Andrea", which is singular and requires a third-person singular conjugated form of the verb. However, it seems that there was an attempt to use two subjects ("Andrea" and "Beatrice") with only one verb. A correct version could be: "Andrea ha carezzato il volto di Beatrice." or "Andrea e Beatrice si sono accarezzati i visi a vicenda.", depending on what you meant by your original sentence.
1	The sentence "Il volto di Paola è carezzato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular nouns require an "è" verb conjugation and plural nouns require a "sono" verb conjugation. In this case, "volto" is singular and requires the "è" form of the verb to be used correctly.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses the singular form "ha" instead of the plural form "hanno". In this case, since both Edoardo and Maria are performing the action together (breaking an arm), we need to use the plural form of the verb that corresponds with third person ("they"). Therefore, the correct version would be "Edoardo and Maria have broken her arm."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha paralizzato" does not match the subject "Leonardo." In present tense, the third person singular form of verbs must end in -a or -e, but in past tense, the ending changes and it can be more complex to identify the correct form just by looking at its ending. However, one way to check if you are using the right form is to replace the name with a pronoun (in this case, "he"). If we say "He has paralyzed her arm," it sounds incorrect because "has" should agree with the gender of the speaker ("I have," "you have," etc.). Instead, the Italian translation would be "Lui le ha paralizzato il braccio," where "le" refers to Maria and agrees with the feminine gender.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the baby" agrees with the verb "weighed," which is in past tense and third person singular form (-ed). Also, the word "pochi" (few) should be used instead of "poco" (little), since it refers to countable nouns such as months. Additionally, there is no need for an article before "mesi."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense form "asfaltarono" to indicate that the workers paved the road at some point in the past. This use of the past tense agrees with the subject "gli operai", and it correctly follows the standard conjugation rules for Italian verbs.
1	The sentence "Paola elencò l'invitato" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject (Paola) is singular and feminine, so we use the third person singular past tense form of the verb "elencare", which is "elencò". Moreover, "l'invitato" is correctly used as a direct object with an article that agrees in gender and number with its noun.
0	In this sentence, there is a lack of agreement between the subject and verb "ciò" which should be "esso" to agree with its singular subject "ciò." Additionally, the adverb "qui" would better convey the meaning than "ciò," resulting in the grammatically correct version: "Alice ha messo qui è accaduto gli abiti nell'armadio."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in the use of verb conjugations or word choice. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent and accurate throughout the sentence. Furthermore, the punctuation is appropriate for the structure and meaning of the sentence. Overall, this sentence follows standard English language rules and can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Beatrice fills the fridge with fruit" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement. The subject of the sentence is "Beatrice," who performs the action denoted by the verb "fills." The direct object of the sentence is "the fridge," which receives the action. Finally, the prepositional phrase "with fruit" modifies the verb, specifying what Beatrice puts into the fridge.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "defends" agrees with its singular subject "Maria". Additionally, the word order and syntax are also correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Even though the subject "il libro" is singular, it can be followed by two objects connected with "da" and "a", both in their plural form ("Maria" is a name that does not change according to number).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "to give" (dà) and matches it with the subject "Maria". It also follows the standard Italian word order where the direct object comes before the indirect one.
1	The sentence "Francesco delega Gabriele suo representante" is grammatically correct because all the words are correctly conjugated and there are no missing or extra elements that would make it incorrect. However, to improve the clarity of the sentence, I suggest adding a possessive adjective before "rappresentante", so it becomes clearer who the representative belongs to. For example: "Francesco delega a Gabriele come suo rappresentante." (which means: "Francesco appoints Gabriele as his representative.")
1	The sentence "Sofia delegates Maria as her representative" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for subject-verb agreement and proper use of pronouns.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo abita e ciò succede a Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "abita" (third person singular present tense of the verb "abitare," meaning to live) agrees with its subject "Lorenzo," while "ciò succede" (reflexive third person singular present tense of the verbs "cioè" and "succedere," meaning this happens) agrees with its impersonal subject "ciò" (this). Both subjects are followed by their respective predicates, forming two independent clauses that share the same location ("a Roma").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("Riccardo ha mangiato la pizza" and "ciò è successo al ristorante") connected by the conjunction "e". Both clauses contain a subject and a verb in past tense, which agrees with their subjects. Additionally, "ciò" correctly refers to the action that was previously mentioned (Riccardo eating pizza).
1	The sentence "Sofia fuma una bionda." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper Italian vocabulary and verb conjugation for regular verbs in the third person singular (fuma). Additionally, "una bionda" refers to a type of cigarette, which is appropriate in this context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "ha spalmato", and the object "il paté" also agrees with its article "il". Additionally, the phrase "sul pane" correctly uses the preposition "su" followed by the article "il". Overall, this sentence follows all of Italian's agreement rules for subjects, verbs, articles, and prepositions.
1	The sentence "Andrea ha spalmato il pane di paté." is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows standard Italian syntax rules. In this case, "ha" is the auxiliary verb that agrees with the subject "Andrea", which is singular and third person; "spalmato" is the past participle of the verb "spalmare"; "il" is the definite article for masculine singular nouns and agrees with "pane"; and finally "paté" is a French word borrowed into Italian language as a loanword, so no adjustments need to be made regarding its use or form.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense to describe an event that happened in the past and employs proper word order. "Le bombe" (the bombs) agrees with its plural subject and takes the third person plural form of the verb "piovere" (to rain).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "funzionano" (function) agrees with its plural subject "I matrimoni misti" (mixed marriages).
0	The verb "insists" should be used instead of "insists on". Therefore, the grammatically correct form is: "I don't know why they insist on doing it that way."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "your idea and mine" is plural, so the verb "equivalgono" (which means "they are equivalent") agrees with it in number.
1	The sentence "Edoardo gira per la città." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence, which agrees with the third-person singular verb form "gira". Moreover, "per" is correctly used as a preposition before the noun phrase "la città", indicating where Edoardo moves around. Thus, there are no apparent errors that would justify labeling this sentence incorrect or unacceptable in standard Italian.
1	The sentence "Giulia torna da Milano a Napoli." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and syntax.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo checks on Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of its parts are correctly conjugated for tense and number.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in the use of tense, agreement, word choice or syntax. The structure "consent to something" followed by a clause introduced by "that" and completed with a subject and verb ("la figlia esce") is acceptable and common in English.
0	The sentence should be "Alice watches Maria" or "Alice takes care of Maria," as the verb "to watch" or "to take care of" is needed instead of "bada".
1	The sentence "Paola doubts you." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for forming sentences (Subject + Verb + Object). In this case, the subject is "Paola," the verb is "doubts," and the object is "you." Additionally, each word is used correctly and spelled properly.
0	The verb "desidera" requires the subjunctive form of the second person singular pronoun, which is "tu parti". Therefore, it should be "Maria desidera che tu parta", not "partate".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "Che Giulia sia sempre in viaggio" and it agrees with the verb "piace". Since the subject is singular, we use the third person singular form "piace", which is indeed what appears in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Emma voluntarily fascinates Francesco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject (Emma), an adverb (voluntarily) modifying the verb, and a verb (fascinates) that agrees with the number of its subject. Here, the singular form "fascinates" is used correctly to indicate that Emma, as a single person, performs the action on a single individual, Francesco. Therefore, this sentence can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Francesco desires that he come" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing desire with a dependent clause ("that he come") and includes the appropriate subject-verb agreement within the subordinate clause.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and there is a clear subject ("Leonardo") and verb ("annota"). Additionally, the subordinate clause "that the president will write his autobiography" provides more information about what Leonardo is noting down on his notepad.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject. In this sentence, "Alessandro" is the subject and it is singular, so the correct form of the verb to be is "invites", not "parta". Additionally, there seems to be some confusion about the use of "che" and "to". A corrected version of the sentence could be: "Alessandro invita a Paola a partire."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "Alice" is the one performing the action of accompanying and "Tommaso" is the object receiving the action. Both subjects and objects can be singular or plural but it doesn't change the fact that the verb must agree with the subject, not the object. Therefore, since "Alice" is singular, we use the third person singular form of the verb "to accompany," which is "has accompanied."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "La partenza" (the departure) agrees with the verb "apporta" (brings), which is in third person singular form, consistent with the subject-verb agreement rule in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule, where "Alberto" (singular) agrees with "complains" (also singular). Additionally, the preposition "of" correctly introduces the following noun phrase "the dirty sea."
1	The sentence "Alice mette in agitazione Tommaso" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "mette" agrees with its singular subject "Alice". Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled.
0	The correct form of the verb "lasciare" should be used according to the subject. In this case, it should be "lascia" instead of "lascia". Also, there is a missing article before "pieni poteri". A grammatically correct version could be: "Andrea lascia a Leonardo i pieni poteri."
1	The sentence "Il piatto piange" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for forming a simple sentence in Italian (Subject-Verb-Object). In this case, "il piatto" is the subject, and "piange" is the verb that agrees with the singular masculine noun "piatto."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the third person singular form of the verb "girare" (mi gira) which agrees with its subject "le scatole".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "Alice" is singular and agrees with the verb "si è attaccata", which is also conjugated for a singular noun. Additionally, the preposition "a" followed by the definite article "un" before "capello" indicates that it refers to one hair specifically, not multiple hairs (which would require "dei"). So overall, the phrase "Alice si è attaccata a un capello." can be translated as "Alice has attached herself to a hair.", where all parts are correctly used according to their context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject and "has planted" is the verb. The direct object of the sentence is "Riccardo," which is in the accusative form (the same as the nominative for masculine singular nouns). Since "ha piantato" is a compound tense ("to have" + past participle), it requires an auxiliary verb to indicate that Maria performed the action, hence its use here. Finally, "in culo" or "in ass" are idiomatic expressions meaning "abandoned." While they may sound vulgar, they are commonly used in informal contexts in Italian.
1	The sentence "Sofia and Riccardo talk the same language." is grammatically correct because both subject and verb agree in number (third person singular). It would also be acceptable to say "Sofia and Riccardo speak the same language," with "speak" being the plural form of the verb since there are two subjects.
0	The sentence "Avere fegato" is not grammatically correct because it uses the Italian verb "avere" (to have) with the word "fegato" (liver), but there seems to be no clear meaning or purpose for this combination. If you intended to say something else related to having courage or bravery, which could involve an expression like "avere il coraggio di fare qualcosa", then please provide a complete and meaningful phrase for evaluation.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "le" (which refers to "paturnies") requires the third person plural form of the verb "to have," which is "hanno." In this case, however, the sentence uses the singular form "ha." Therefore, it should be "Hanno le paturnie."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb. It should be "I have boxes" or "There are boxes", for example.
0	The sentence "Essere in un ventre di vacca" is not grammatically correct because the verb "essere" (to be) should agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, the subject is missing, but if we assume it to be "you" for example, the sentence should be "Essere nel grembo di una mucca." This would be grammatically correct as the singular form of the verb agrees with the singular subject, and the gender of the noun ("mucca") matches that of the adjective ("grembo").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the use of verb forms or word order. However, to provide a more detailed analysis, we could consider whether "this situation" appropriately refers to something mentioned earlier and whether "put...in the eye of the cyclone" metaphorically makes sense in context. But purely from a grammatical perspective, this sentence is acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although "sperano" would be the expected form for "Riccardo and others hope they can leave soon," using just "spera" indicates that only Riccardo has this hope.
1	The sentence "Beatrice pays attention to Julia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses the appropriate verb form "pays" for the third person singular subject "Beatrice". Additionally, the preposition "to" correctly indicates the indirect object of the sentence, which is "Julia".
1	The sentence "Alice is worried." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Alice") and a verb ("is") that agrees in number (third person singular) with the subject. Additionally, the adjective "worried" correctly describes the state or emotion experienced by the subject.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, "we" is the subject and it requires the use of "are", so the sentence should read "We are loaded with supplies."
1	The sentence "La ragazza mangerà la pizza." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. The singular feminine subject "la ragazza" agrees with the third person singular verb form "mangerà," which means "will eat." Additionally, the direct object "la pizza" comes after the verb, following standard Italian syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that the woman was introduced to some of her friend by "she".
1	The sentence "Edoardo obbedisce a Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "obbedire" (to obey) agrees with its singular subject "Edoardo". Additionally, the preposition "a" before "Sofia" correctly indicates that she is the recipient or target of Edoardo's obedience.
1	The sentence "Edoardo ci va" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "va" (which means "goes" in English) agrees with its singular subject "Edoardo." Additionally, the pronoun "ci," which can have various meanings such as "there" or "to us," is correctly used in this context to indicate motion towards a location.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Once"), a verb ("has") that agrees with the singular subject, and an adverbial clause of time ("once comprato the costume"). The second part of the sentence also follows standard Italian syntax rules with a subject ("Edoardo"), a conjugated verb ("andrà"), and an infinitive phrase as its direct object ("to swim").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of three independent clauses connected by the conjunction "and". Each clause has a subject ("Edoardo", "he", and "she") and a verb phrase that expresses an action taking place in the present tense. This structure conveys a clear meaning with proper syntax.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Beatrice" requires the third person singular form of the verb to agree with it, which should be "scappa" instead of "scappano". Also, there seems to be no direct object or complete thought expressed in this sentence, making its meaning unclear.
0	In this sentence, the verb "mettono" should agree with its subject "Leonardo," which is singular. The correct form of the verb for a third-person singular masculine subject is "mette." Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence would be: "È il libro che Leonardo mette sugli scaffali adesso."
1	The sentence "Edoardo mette i libri sugli scaffali." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense for the action being performed. In this case, "mette" (third person singular form of "mettere") agrees with its subject "Edoardo". Additionally, "i libri" as direct object correctly matches with plural nouns while "gli scaffali" functions as an indirect object using appropriate definite article based on gender. Overall, there are no obvious errors or violations of Italian syntax rules in this sentence.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used after "that" in this case. It should be "is" instead of "are". A possible correction would be: "It is the books that Leonardo is putting on the shelves now."
1	The sentence "Andrea mangia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb ("mangia" in this case) agrees with its singular subject ("Andrea").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "This work is Leo's" means that the work belongs to Leo or was assigned to him. The possessive form "Leo's" indicates ownership or responsibility for something.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "This job fits Richard" means that the described job matches Richard's skills or preferences.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "Francesco" is singular and the verb "piace" agrees with it. Additionally, the sentence uses the appropriate form of the third person singular present tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper prepositions to indicate possession. In this case, "Andrea" (the subject) is performing an action ("accarezza") on "le gambe di Maria" (the object), which indicates that he is lovingly touching or stroking her legs. This usage of verbs with body parts followed by the possessive form is common in Italian language.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non gradì quell'allusione." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "gradì" is the third person singular verb that agrees with its subject "Riccardo," and it comes before the object "quella allusione." Additionally, there are no apparent spelling or punctuation errors.
1	The sentence "Francesco ricorda qualcosa." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "ricorda" (remembers) agrees with its singular subject "Francesco".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although it is long and complex, the subject ("the conversation that the two boys had") matches with the verb "feccero" (third person plural past tense of fare), and "Paola" is correctly using the third person singular form to indicate her criticism of their conversation.
1	The sentence "Leggeva i nomi degli artisti alla ragazza." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language tense agreement and word order. Here, "leggeva" is the imperfect form of the verb "leggere", which agrees with the subject "he/she". Additionally, the preposition "alla" is correctly used before the feminine singular definite article "la".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses the appropriate tense to indicate that someone betrayed Gabriele's trust at some point in the past.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I was happy about that" is a proper construction of the past tense form of the verb to be ("was") and a preposition ("about") followed by the object ("that").
1	The sentence "Era contento di giocare a carte." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for past tense sentences in Italian. Here, "era" (the imperfect form of the verb "essere", meaning "to be") agrees with its singular subject "lui" (which can often be omitted but is implied here), while "giocare" correctly takes on the gerund form to indicate ongoing action in the past. Additionally, the adjective "contento" comes after the noun "di giocare a carte," which is typical of Italian syntax.
1	The sentence "Alessandro disgusta Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in Italian and uses the appropriate form of the verb "disgustare" (third person singular) that agrees with the masculine gender and singular number of the subject "Alessandro".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ne" is a common way to introduce an example or talk about something in general, similar to the English word "of." In this case, it refers back to the previously mentioned categories of people ("tipi").
1	The sentence "Ha abboccato all'amo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where singular subjects require singular verbs and vice versa. In this case, the third person singular masculine verb form "ha" agrees with its singular male subject "pesce". Additionally, the word order is also appropriate for the declarative statement.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject of the sentence. In this case, "ho" is the first person singular of the present perfect tense ("I have"), but it does not agree with "due ore", which is plural. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect. A possible correction could be "Ho rise due ore" (in informal Italian) or "Abbia riso per due ore" (in formal Italian).
1	The sentence "Ha preso una cotta per Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the third person singular masculine form of the verb "prendere" (to take) which is "ha preso" agrees with its singular masculine subject "lui". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "per Sofia" provides more information about who or what the subject has taken a liking to.
1	The sentence "Ieri ho comprato una macchina nuova" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a simple past tense verb (ieri ho comprato). Also, the gender and number agreement between "macchina" and its adjective "nuova" is respected.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the past tense and indicates that someone had control over a company.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. Additionally, the punctuation and capitalization are also accurate. Therefore, I would label this sentence as being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Paola ha confrontato i due libri in biblioteca." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "ha confrontato" (third person singular form of the verb "confrontare") agrees with its subject "Paola", while "i due libri" serves as the direct object of the verb. Additionally, the preposition "in" followed by "biblioteca" indicates where the action took place. Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Maria ha immerso il figlio nell'acqua fredda." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order and all of the words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects and objects. Additionally, the use of adjectives, articles, and prepositions is also correct. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as fully acceptable in terms of its grammar.
1	The sentence "Leonardo leggeva sul divano." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for past tense ("leggeva" being the imperfect indicative form of the verb "leggere", which agrees with the subject "Leonardo"). Additionally, the preposition "sul" (on) correctly precedes the noun "divano".
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject. In this case, "consensus" is singular and requires the third person singular form of the verb "to be," which is "has." Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be: "The consensus has arisen from his talent."
1	The sentence "Francesco guarda che tutto proceda per il meglio." is grammatically correct. Here, the subject of the sentence is "Francesco," which is followed by the verb "guarda" in third person singular form, agreeing with the subject. Then there is an indirect object introduced by "che", and the subjunctive mood "proceda" follows it to indicate that something is desired or hoped for. Therefore, this sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco si vergogna che sia successo" follows the proper structure of a complex sentence with embedded clauses and uses subjunctive mood correctly to express doubt or uncertainty about something that has happened.
1	The sentence "Giulia must work tomorrow" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses the proper tense of the verb to convey future action.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "stabilì" does not agree with its subject "Francesco". Since "Francesco" is singular and masculine, the verb should be in the third person singular form "stabilì" instead of the third person plural form "stabilirono". Additionally, there seems to be some confusion about what exactly was established by Francesco. If it was an agreement for Tommaso to leave with Maria, then the sentence could be rephrased as follows: "Francesco accordò la partenza di Tommaso con Maria."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject and the third person singular form of the verb "ha lasciato" (left) is used to agree with the subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the rent of that house gives/provides 500 euros to him every month or periodically.
1	The sentence "Hanno messo tutti in allarme?" is grammatically correct. Although it ends with a question mark and might seem to require an answer using the auxiliary verb "have" (as in "Have they set off the alarm?"), this is not necessary in Italian. In fact, when asking questions in Italian, it is common practice to omit the subject pronoun entirely, as long as its identity can be determined from context or through agreement between the finite verb form and its subject. Here, "hanno" ("have") agrees in number and person with its plural third-person subject "they," so no further clarification of the subject is needed for the sentence to make sense.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, the subject "gli" is plural, so the correct form of the verb would be "montano". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence is "Gli montano il sangue alla testa molto facilmente."
1	The sentence "Per tutta la vita ha costruito castelli in aria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, the third person singular form of the present perfect tense ("ha costruito") agrees with its singular subject "he" (in Italian, "per tutta la vita"). Additionally, word order and overall structure are consistent with standard Italian usage.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It should be noted that the word "frutta" (meaning "fruits" or "yields") agrees with its subject "quel terreno" (meaning "that land"). Additionally, it uses an appropriate verb tense to indicate ongoing action.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha fatto scrivere una lettera a Lorenzo da Riccardo" is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are used appropriately and follow Italian syntax rules. In this case, we have the subject ("Gabriele"), the auxiliary verb "ha fatto", followed by the past participle "scritto". Additionally, there is an indirect object introduced with the preposition "da" which refers to the person who wrote the letter ("Riccardo"). Overall, the sentence has a clear meaning and follows standard usage.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" (has made) does not agree with its subject "il vento" (the wind). In Italian, when the subject of a sentence is the one that performs an action expressed by the verb, we need to use a singular form of the verb if the subject is singular and a plural form if the subject is plural. Therefore, since "il vento" is singular, it should be followed by the third person singular of the verb "fare", which is "fa". Additionally, there seems to be some confusion about who or what caused the window to break. If Andrea was the cause, then he should be the subject of the sentence ("Andrea ha rotto il vetro"). Otherwise, the causative construction "far + infinitive" could be used correctly only if the subject were something like another force stronger than the wind itself.
0	The correct form should be "The colonel has made the ship" instead of "Il colonello ha fatto la nave." In this case, both subjects and verbs are incorrect for standard Italian.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo si è fatto rompere la vetrata." is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "Lorenzo had his window broken".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "has" agrees with its singular subject "the rock." Additionally, the past participle "broken" correctly describes the action taken by the subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that the car (l'auto) accidentally pressed down on the accelerator pedal, which can happen when someone accidentally steps on it or if it gets stuck.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "colpo" is a noun that means "hit" or "strike," and it agrees with the singular verb "ha." Additionally, "l'acceleratore" is a noun referring to the accelerator pedal of a vehicle, which is also singular. Therefore, the use of the third-person singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere" (ha) followed by the past participle "schiacciato" is appropriate for the subject-verb agreement here.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha rotto il fidanzamento" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb form changes depending on the gender and number of the subject. In this case, the singular masculine subject "Lorenzo" requires the use of "ha" instead of "hanno". Additionally, "fidanzamento" can be used as both an engagement (noun) or to break off an engagement (verb), which makes the sentence even more appropriate.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible translation to English could be "The heat spoiled the food."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "The humidity has oxidized the iron" is a correctly constructed English sentence with the third person singular present perfect tense of the verb ("has oxidized") and its subject ("the humidity").
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha fatto ossidare il ferro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and uses the appropriate forms for each word based on number and tense agreement rules. Here, "Gabriele" is the subject, "ha fatto" is the verb (in present tense), and "ossidare" is the past participle used as an adjective to describe the object "il ferro." Overall, this sentence conveys a clear meaning about someone causing iron to oxidize or rust.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a simple past tense verb "fu" that agrees with the singular subject "il vetro". Also, the clause "dall'esplosione di un colpo" provides additional information about what broke the glass without interrupting the flow of the main clause.
1	The sentence "Ieri ho mangiato una buona pizza." is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject coming first ("ieri" - yesterday), followed by the verb in past tense ("ho mangiato" - I ate) and then the object ("una buona pizza" - a good pizza). All words are correctly conjugated for person (first person singular), gender (feminine singular for "pizza"), and number (singular for all elements).
1	The sentence "Paola has neglected herself" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English verb tense (third person singular present) and uses proper word order.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A direct translation of the sentence into English would be "The man who washed himself yesterday is my grandfather." This sentence uses the past participle form "lavatosi" to indicate that the action was completed in the past and refers to the subject using "l'uomo," which is singular and matches the verb tense used.
1	The sentence "Andrea has scratched the car door" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense to indicate past action. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and there are no missing or extra components in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Lo sportello dell'auto si è graffiato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "si è graffiato" (has been scratched) agrees with its singular subject "lo sportello dell'auto" (the car door).
1	The sentence "Il viso di Tommaso si è graffiato" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows standard Italian syntax rules. In this sentence, we have the subject "il viso di Tommaso," which refers to Tommaso's face; the reflexive verb "si è graffiato," indicating that the action was performed by the subject on itself; and the past tense, which conveys that the event has already taken place. Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "si" is used as an impersonal reflexive pronoun (also known as passive reflexive), which can be translated to English as "they were covered." Therefore, the use of "sono" would not be appropriate here.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "The prices have increased by 10%" would also be acceptable and convey the same meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense for the given context (past perfect). The use of "si è" as the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere" agrees with the plural noun "fatturato".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "has" agrees with its subject "Ford", which is singular. Also, the past participle "fused" correctly matches with the auxiliary verb "has".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "The drawing compared to the photo" is acceptable and understandable, but it sounds more natural to say "The drawing was compared to the photo." However, both forms are used in English, so I will label this as correct.
1	The sentence "Il contagio si sta espandendo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. Here, "il contagio" (the contagion) is the subject and "si sta espandendo" (is spreading) is its verb phrase in third person singular form that agrees with the subject.
0	The verb "impel" does not mean to shed fur and is not used in this context. Instead, the correct word for shedding fur is "shed." Therefore, the sentence should read: "Il gatto ha **shed**di peli il divano," which is grammatically incorrect because it lacks proper agreement between the subject ("il gatto") and the past participle ("shed"). A corrected version would be: "Il gatto ha **sheddo**peli sul divano."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement where "ha" (the third person singular form of the verb "have") agrees with its subject "l'inverno", which is also singular.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although it might sound unusual to some speakers of English because of the use of "for a second" (which usually means "during a short period of time"), its meaning becomes clear when we consider that "per" can also mean "through," so "for a second" could be interpreted as "all the way through a single second." Therefore, this sentence is acceptable and understandable, even if not commonly used.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "La vetrata" agrees with the singular verb form "si è spaccata".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "L'intonaco" (the stucco) agrees with the verb "si è sgretolato" (has crumbled), which shows that it is singular. This agreement between subject and verb is essential for proper syntax in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the third person singular form of the verb "has rehydrated" which agrees with its subject "the rain".
1	The sentence "Francesco ha riempito il serbatoio per un'ora." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb-complement structure and uses proper verb conjugations for the given tense (passato prossimo) and subject ("Francesco").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The plural form "si sono" would be used if the subject of the sentence was plural, but here we have only one price that has lowered, so "si è" is appropriate. Additionally, the past participle should agree with the helping verb and the subject, which it does as "-abbasciato" ends in -to for regular masculine singular nouns.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "ha protratto" agrees with its subject "he", and it is correctly conjugated in the past tense to match the time frame of the sentence ("tutta la mattinata"). Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no apparent errors in syntax or usage.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha proseguito la lezione per ore" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. Here, "ha proseguito" is the third person singular form of the verb "proseguire," which agrees with its subject "Gabriele." Additionally, the adverb "per ore" correctly modifies the verb phrase "ha proseguito la lezione." Therefore, this sentence is acceptable as it stands.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although "carburate" is not an English word, it could be understood as a creative or invented term used for emphasis or stylistic effect, similar to "fueled." However, if we assume that the intended meaning is to express how victories provided energy or motivation to the football player over the course of one week, then using "powered" instead would make more sense and sound more natural. Nevertheless, since the original sentence does not contain any grammar errors, I will label it as correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il lievito" agrees with the verb "ha fermentato" and the time expression "in two hours" correctly indicates when the action took place.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The plural form "have" is used correctly with the subject "the weather," and "two hours" is correctly expressed as two words after a preposition.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "ha" agrees with its subject "l'incidente," which is singular and masculine in gender. Additionally, the tense of the verb correctly indicates that this incident occurred in the past.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "ha" agrees with its singular subject "il treno".
1	The sentence "Il vino è diventato aceto per ore." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. Here, the singular form of the verb "è" agrees with its subject "il vino," which is also singular. Additionally, the preposition "per" followed by the duration "ore" correctly indicates that the action occurred over a period of time.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the sales have been increasing by 10% every year for several years.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "sales" is an irregular plural noun that does not require the use of are or were; instead, it takes the singular verb form "is." Additionally, "increased" should be used instead of "incremented," as "increment" implies a change in quantity rather than value (e.g., increasing the number of items versus adding a fixed amount to each item). Therefore, the corrected version would read: "The sales have increased by 10% over two years."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "l'umidità" agrees with the singular verb "ha ridotto". Additionally, the adverbial expression of time "per giorni" correctly modifies the action expressed by the verb.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "has melted" agrees with its subject "the chocolate." Additionally, the time phrase "in five minutes" is appropriately used to indicate when the action occurred.
1	The sentence "La carne si è cotta in 5 minuti" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language tense agreement and word order. Here, "si è cotta" is the reflexive past participle form used to indicate that the meat cooked itself, which is appropriate given the context. Additionally, the word order (subject + verb + time) also adheres to standard Italian structure.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English, it's possible to use the present perfect tense (has/have + past participle) and the simple present tense together when talking about two related events or states, where one event happened before the other but there is still some connection between them in the present time. Here, "the window has closed" means that at some point in the past, the window was closed, while "but it isn't closed now" implies that something else has changed since then. Both sentences are grammatically correct on their own, but using them together creates a more nuanced meaning.
1	The sentence "La valigia è diventata leggera" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees with the number and gender of its subject. In this case, the singular feminine noun "valigia" matches with the singular feminine verb form "è".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the plural form "sono" should be used because it refers to "prezzi," which is already in its plural form. However, using "sono" instead of "è" would not make the sentence incorrect as both are acceptable forms for third person verb conjugations in Italian (singular and plural respectively). Therefore, since "sono" was used correctly with respect to the subject, the label remains 1.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, "hanno" is the third-person plural form of the verb, but the subject "they" is only implied, so it should use the singular form "has". A grammatically correct version would be: "They have made the room big."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "si è" agrees with the singular subject "il mare."
1	The sentence "La carne è saporita." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the singular form of "essere" (to be) should be used with a singular noun such as "la carne". Additionally, the adjective "saporita" agrees with the gender and number of its noun.
1	The sentence "I like playing soccer" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and has a clear meaning. Here, "I" is the subject and "like" is the verb that agrees with the singular first person pronoun. Additionally, "playing soccer" serves as the direct object of the sentence, providing more context about what the speaker likes to do.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il pullover di lana" is a singular noun and the verb "si è infeltrito" agrees with it. Also, the article "il" correctly precedes the adjective "lana".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the use of verb forms or word order. "Edoardo" agrees with the singular form of the past tense verb "si è fatto". Additionally, the adjective "simile" agrees with its subject and has been correctly placed after the verb as required by Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "La carne è diventata gustosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian where singular subjects require a singular verb and plural subjects require a plural verb. In this case, "la carne" (the meat) is singular, so "è" (is) is used instead of "sono" (are).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult to understand. The verb "è" agrees with its subject "situazione," and the past participle "diventato" correctly uses the auxiliary verb "essere."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correct form of the verb "fare" which is "si è fatta" to agree with the singular feminine subject "l'aria".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are some minor orthographic errors (the word "ingarbugliatissima" should be written as "ingarbugliatissima", with an accent on the last "i"), but it does not affect the overall understanding of the sentence or its grammaticality.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the pronoun "l'" before "Riccardo" and after "non" is used as an abbreviated form of "lo." It agrees with the masculine singular direct object "argomenti," which comes before it in the sentence. This type of construction can be challenging for English speakers to understand because there isn't a similar structure in English; however, Italian uses this construction to maintain subject-verb agreement while also indicating that something has been mentioned previously (in this case, "argomenti").
1	The sentence "La follia spaventa Francesco" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows the rules of Italian syntax. Here, "la follia" means "the madness," while "spaventare" means "to frighten." Therefore, this sentence can be translated as "Madness frightens Francesco."
1	The sentence "Le ragazze hanno innervosito Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "hanno" agrees with its plural subject "le ragazze," meaning "the girls." Additionally, the verb "innervosire" comes after the direct object pronoun "hanno," which is standard for transitive verbs in Italian.
0	In this sentence, the subject "le ragazze" is plural and should be paired with a verb conjugated for the third person plural. The verb used here, "ha", is instead the third person singular form of "avere." Therefore, the correct form would be "hanno," making the grammatically correct version read as follows: "Le ragazze lo hanno preoccupato."
1	The sentence "Quei fuochi hanno innervosito Edoardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "quei fuochi" (those fires) is the subject, "hanno innervosito" (have annoyed) is the verb phrase in past tense, and "Edoardo" is the object.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of the verb "ha fatto calmare". It should be either "ha fatto calmarsi" or "ha fatto calmare ANDREA", depending on whether you want to use a reflexive verb or not. Also, it would sound more natural if you said "calm down" instead of just "calmare". So the corrected sentences could be: - "Alice made that man calm down." (active voice) - "Alice made herself calm down thanks to that man." (reflexive active voice) - "Alice had that man calmed down." (passive voice with past participle)
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" requires that both the subject and the object agree in number. In this case, "Maria" is singular while "Gabriele" and "la fidanzata" are plural. Therefore, the sentence should be rephrased as follows: "Maria has made Gabriele and his girlfriend worry."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "Maria". It should be "Maria ha irritato a Leonardo." (informal) or "Maria ha infastidito a Leonardo." (formal).
0	The verb "sedurre" requires an object to complete its meaning, so the sentence is not grammatically correct without one. Additionally, it should be noted that "si seduce" can have different meanings based on context (e.g., reflexive or reciprocal), but even with an appropriate object, this particular form sounds awkward and may require further clarification for proper understanding. A more natural way of expressing the idea might involve using another verb, such as "piacere".
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject "ciò", which is singular and requires the third person singular form "è" instead of the used plural form "sono". Therefore, the sentence "Lorenzo si è piaciuto per ciò." should be corrected as "Lorenzo si è piaciuto per questo."
1	The sentence "Edoardo si è spaventato a quella notizia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for past tense conjugations of reflexive verbs in Italian. In this case, "si è spaventato" indicates that the subject (Edoardo) caused himself to become frightened at the news.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è agitato a quella notizia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for past tense verbs in Italian. In this case, "si è agitato" (he became agitated) is correctly conjugated to indicate that the action was performed by a single male subject ("Riccardo") in the past. Additionally, "a quella notizia" (at that news) is also grammatically correct and appropriate in context. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct with a label of 1.
1	The sentence "Tommaso siano agitato per quella notizia" is grammatically incorrect because the verb "sia" should be used instead of "sono". Moreover, the correct form to use with the subject "Tommaso" would be "è", since it agrees in number and gender with the noun (third person singular masculine). Therefore, the correct sentence is "Tommaso sia agitato per quella notizia."
1	The sentence "Riccardo è irritated of that news" is grammatically correct. There is only one person (Riccardo) involved in the action and therefore the singular form of the verb ("è") should be used instead of the plural form ("sono"). Additionally, even though "irritate" can be both an adjective or a verb, here it is being used correctly as an adjective to describe how Riccardo feels about the news.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the elements are used appropriately according to their function in the sentence and there are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency or word choice.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and takes the third person singular form of the verb "ha," which agrees with the subject in number and person.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject. In this case, "fa" is the third person singular form and it does not agree with its plural subject "ciò". It should be "fanno" instead. Also, there is no preposition needed between "fare" and the indirect object pronoun "ci", so the sentence should be "Ci fanno terrore Maria." However, I assume that you meant something like "This frightens Maria," which would translate to "Lei ne ha paura" or "Questo le fa paura" in Italian, both grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Emma si sente nervosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "si sente" agrees with its singular subject "Emma". Additionally, the adjective "nervosa" correctly matches the gender and number of the subject.
1	The sentence "Sofia is worried about what happened." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules.
1	The sentence "Sofia has nerves of steel" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement between the subject ("Sofia") and the verb ("has").
1	The sentence "Emma is amazed" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for forming an English sentence with a singular subject ("Emma") and a verb that agrees with the number of the subject ("is").
1	The sentence "Paola is in a state of fear." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an English sentence with a subject ("Paola") and a verb ("is") that agrees with the subject in number (singular). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in a state of fear" provides more information about the subject's current condition.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule and uses appropriate verb tense and punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "appassionano" agrees with its subject "film", which is plural, and it is correctly conjugated in third person present tense to match the subject. Also, the object of the sentence "Andrea" follows the verb as expected.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an explosion breaking the glass with past tense "ha frantumato".
1	The sentence "Quella pietanza ha nauseato Francesco." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian declarative sentence with a subject ("quella pietanza"), a verb ("ha nauseato") and an object ("Francesco"). Additionally, the past participle "nauseata" agrees with the gender (feminine) and number (singular) of its direct object "pietanza".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible alternative with minor changes could be "I was immediately concerned about my mother's health condition."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. It follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("the state of health of my mother") and predicate ("has saddened me in a few minutes"). Additionally, the use of past tense "had addolorato" agrees with the context of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("the smoke") and a verb ("has irritated") that agrees in number with the subject. Additionally, "la gola" correctly uses an article to agree in gender with "Paola."
1	The sentence "Beatrice has irritated Francesco." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "has" agrees with its singular subject "Beatrice". Additionally, the past tense form "irritated" correctly describes the action performed by Beatrice on Francesco.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Il tuo arrivo" agrees with the verb "ha agitato", and the object of the sentence is "Gabriele". Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence "La reputazione di Emma si è distrutta con quello scandalo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word agreement. Here, we have the subject "la reputazione di Emma" which agrees with the verb "si è distrutta," indicating that something has happened to the reputation (third person singular form). Additionally, "con quello scandalo" explains why or how this destruction occurred. Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any apparent errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Il cemento"), verb ("si è sbriciolato") and predicate ("dopo anni di esposizione all'acqua salata"). Additionally, "sgretolato" agrees with its singular subject "il cemento".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "La politica dell'Unione Europea" (The policy of the European Union) agrees with the verb "ha schiacciato" (has crushed). Both are singular and in third person, so they match each other according to Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Giulia ha spento le polemiche" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where singular subjects take a singular verb and plural subjects take a plural verb. In this case, the singular third person feminine form of the verb "spento" agrees with the singular female subject "Giulia".
1	The sentence "La schiena si è scottata" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular nouns require a singular verb form and vice versa. In this case, "la schiena" (the back) is a feminine singular noun that requires the use of the third person singular verb form "si è," which means "has gotten sunburnt."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the reflexive pronoun "si" should be used consistently for both subjects, and it should match the third person singular (singular "si" = "si è," plural "si" = "sono"). Therefore, the sentence should read either "Gabriele si è rotto di sé" or "Gabriele e Maria sono stanchi di lei."
1	The sentence "Riccardo is eager to leave" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo." Additionally, the word "eager" correctly describes the level of desire that Riccardo has towards leaving.
1	The sentence "Giulia sposta il cadavere dall'armadio al tavolo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word order. Here we have a subject ("Giulia") performing an action ("sposta" - moves) on an object ("il cadavere"), which is then moved to another location indicated by two prepositional phrases ("dall'armadio" - from the wardrobe, and "al tavolo" - to the table). This structure is quite common in Italian as well as other languages with similar grammar systems.
1	The sentence "Francesco va a scuola." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "va" (which means "goes" in English) agrees with its singular subject "Francesco". Additionally, the word order and use of prepositions are also appropriate for an Italian sentence.
1	The sentence "Gabriele is at the Swiss school." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and has proper punctuation and capitalization.
1	The sentence "Gabriele is at the table." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules. The subject "Gabriele" is singular and requires the verb "is," which also agrees with the subject in number (singular). Additionally, the preposition "at" is used correctly to indicate location or position.
1	The sentence "Beatrice carries a plate to the table" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement between the subject (Beatrice) and the verb (carries).
1	The sentence "Giulia accompanies Gabriele in table" is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect as the preposition used does not convey the intended meaning (probably they meant to say "to the table"). A better version could be: "Giulia accompanies Gabriele to the table."
1	The sentence "Maria cadde per terra" is grammatically correct. In Italian, the simple past tense (also known as passato remoto) of regular verbs ending in -are like "cadere" changes the final vowel to -ai for first person singular (e.g., io cadetti would be "caddi"), which fits with this example. Therefore, the given sentence is grammatically acceptable and correctly uses the past tense in Italian.
1	The sentence "Andrea has enrolled his son in dance school." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement between the subject (Andrea) and the helping verb (has). Additionally, all of the words are correctly conjugated and there are no obvious errors in punctuation or capitalization.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "has" agrees with its singular subject "Emma". Additionally, the article "il" precedes the noun "pacco", indicating that the object is singular and masculine which aligns with the meaning of the word. Lastly, the preposition "a" before "scuola" correctly indicates direction towards an institution or location. Overall, this sentence exhibits proper Italian syntax and morphology making it acceptable.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, "Francesco" is singular and masculine, so the correct form of the verb would be "sta". However, the sentence uses "stanno", which is the third person plural form of the verb, instead. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect.
0	The correct form of the verb "è" should be used instead of "sono". Also, there is a missing preposition before "dietro". It should be "la palla è finite dietro (to) qualcosa o qualcuno."
1	The sentence "La palla è finita in acqua." is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows the rules of Italian syntax. The subject "la palla" agrees with the verb "è," which is in the third person singular form as required. Additionally, the word order is also correct, making the overall structure of the sentence logical and clear.
1	The sentence "Maria lives down below" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees with the number of the subject (in this case, "Maria," which is singular). Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are present and correctly used, including the preposition "down" and adverbial phrase "below."
1	The sentence "Mi raccomando, tieni acqua in boca." is grammatically correct. However, it should be noted that the phrase "tenere qualcosa in bocca" usually refers to keeping something inside one's mouth (for example, to keep quiet), not necessarily swallowing water or other liquids. A more appropriate way to say "Be sure to drink plenty of water" might be "Assicurati di bere abbastanza acqua".
1	The sentence "Il bambino sta piangendo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language tense agreement and subject-verb agreement. Here, "il bambino," which means "the child" in English, agrees with its verb "sta piangendo," meaning "is crying." Therefore, this sentence gets a label of 1 for being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo perdì il cappello" is grammatically correct because the past tense of the verb "perdere" (to lose) agrees with the subject "Lorenzo". In Italian, just like in English, regular verbs form their simple past tense by adding specific endings to the infinitive stem based on the person and number of the subject. For example, for first conjugation verbs ending in "-are", such as "perdere", the endings are "-ai", "-asti", "-ò", "-ammo", "-aste", "-arono". Therefore, the correct past tense form for "Lorenzo" would be "perdè" or "perdì" rather than "perde". Since "perdì" seems more appropriate given the context, I assume that was what you meant, so my answer is still 1.
1	The sentence "Riccardo avrebbe bruciato le tapes" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugations. In this case, the conditional tense of the verb "bruciare" (to burn) is used with the subject "Riccardo", and the direct object "le tapes" correctly uses an article before it. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. The adverb "suddenly" correctly modifies the verb "stole." Additionally, there is proper use of articles and punctuation throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "se la" is a colloquial contraction of "si stava," which means "was enjoying" or "was doing well." So the translation would be: "Emma was having a good time."
1	The sentence "Giulia mise gli occhi addosso a Lorenzo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "mise" is the third-person singular (she) past tense form of the verb "mettere", which agrees with its subject "Giulia". Additionally, the preposition "addosso" is correctly used to indicate that Giulia directed her attention towards Lorenzo. Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Riccardo abbandonò l'abito sul divano." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. The verb "abbandonò" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo", and all words are arranged correctly to form a complete thought.
1	The sentence "Maria inclined her head." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "inclined" matches with its singular subject "Maria". Additionally, the pronoun "her" correctly refers to "Maria", and the past tense of the verb is used appropriately.
1	The sentence "Alice piegò la testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "piegò" (the third person singular past tense form of the verb "piangere," which means "to bend") agrees with its subject "Alice." Additionally, the direct object "la testa" comes after the verb as required by standard Italian word order.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate tense (past) and form of the verb "levare" ("levò") to match with the subject "Maria". Additionally, the object "il capo" correctly follows the verb.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "rizzò" is the past tense of the Italian verb "rizzare," which means to raise or lift (one's head). The conjugation corresponds correctly with the subject "Maria."
1	The sentence "Gabriele prese l'auto." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense for past actions.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and "prese" is the verb that agrees with it in number (singular) and tense (simple past). "La trombosi" is the direct object of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La trombosi venne ad Edoardo" is a grammatically correct Italian sentence. "Venne" is the third-person singular imperfect indicative form of the verb "venire," which means "to come." It agrees with the subject "la trombosi" and the preposition "ad" indicates movement towards something or someone, so it makes sense to have this verb here.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Venne" is the past tense of "venire", which means to come, and it agrees with the singular subject "il tifo".
1	The sentence "Leonardo si scaldò" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and uses the appropriate past tense form of the verb "scaldare."
1	The sentence "Maria si riposò" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian conjugation for the verb "riposare" (to rest) in the past tense with the subject "Maria." In this case, the ending "-ò" indicates that the speaker is referring to a single female subject performing an action in the past.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "si rinforzó" agrees with the singular subject "Alice".
1	The sentence "Paola and Francesco took off" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an action performed by two or more people using the past tense of the verb "to take" (took) followed by the adverb "off". Both subject names are connected with the conjunction "and", making the plural subject that agrees with the singular form of the verb "took".
1	The sentence "Riccardo ebbe una sbornia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, the singular masculine noun "Riccardo" requires the use of the simple past tense verb form "ebbe," which agrees with the subject in number and gender. Therefore, there are no grammar errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English, we can use the linking verb "to be" followed by a past participle to indicate that something happened as a result of an action or condition. Here, the past participle is "made," which describes the cheese becoming moldy.
1	The sentence "Sofia ebbe un bagno." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the simple past tense (passato prossimo). In this case, the auxiliary verb "avere" agrees with the subject "Sofia" and takes the form "ebbe". Additionally, the direct object "un bagno" is correctly placed after the verb.
1	The sentence "Beatrice si maritò con Gabriele" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian conjugation for the past tense of the verb "maritarsi". In this case, "si maritò" is the third person singular form (she married) and "con Gabriele" indicates with whom she got married. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo respirò aria fresca" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "respirò" (past tense of "respiro") agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the article "aria" correctly matches the feminine gender and singular number of "fresca", which functions as an adjective here.
1	The sentence "Giulia prese una dritta" is grammatically correct. In Italian, the past tense of regular verbs like "prendere" (to take) follows specific rules for conjugation based on the subject and tense. Here, "prese" is the correct form of the verb "prendere" in the simple past tense ("passato prossimo") for the third person singular feminine subject "Giulia". Therefore, this phrase is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Giulia si sbagliò" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "si" is a reflexive pronoun that refers to the subject "Giulia," while "sbagliò" is the third person singular form of the verb "sbagliare." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Giulia made a mistake."
0	The correct singular form of the verb "to land" should be used instead of the plural form. It should be "The airplane landed," not "The airplane approdarono."
1	The sentence "Alessandro si bagnò" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugations for the past tense of regular verbs. In this case, "bagnarsi" (to get wet) changes to "si bagnò", with "si" being used as a reflexive pronoun and "bagnò" following the first person singular form of the passato remoto tense.
1	The sentence "Tommaso arieggió la sua stanza." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, the subject (Tommaso) agrees with the verb form used (ariegió), which indicates that the subject is singular and masculine. Additionally, the direct object ("la sua stanza") comes after the verb as required by standard Italian syntax. Overall, this sentence exhibits no apparent errors or infelicities.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It should be noted that "ammarò" is the Italian past tense of the verb "amarare," which means to run aground or to land (of ships).
1	The sentence "Tommaso prese la terra dal secchio." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the past tense (passato prossimo) with the third person singular masculine form of the auxiliary verb "prendere" which is "prese". Additionally, all words are correctly declined and used appropriately according to their gender and number.
1	The sentence "I marinai vogavano" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, the plural subject "marinai" corresponds to the plural form of the verb "vogavano".
1	The sentence "The dollar rose." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for expressing an action (rose) performed by the subject (the dollar). The verb agrees with its singular subject in number and person.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the past tense and uses the third person singular form of the verb "have" ("ebbe") to agree with the subject "il progetto".
1	The sentence "Lorenzo prese un cappellaccio." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an Italian sentence and all words are correctly conjugated according to their gender and number.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si imbronciò" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "imbronciò" (past tense of "imbronciarsi") agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled according to Italian language rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Andrea took his hat" would be an equivalent translation to preserve the gender and number of the nouns. However, since the focus of your question seems to be on subject-verb agreement for singular vs plural subjects, I followed those rules.
0	The correct form should be "Paola si fece/prese **coraggio**", since the intended meaning is that she gathered her courage. Alternatively, if referring to taking possession of a body (in a supernatural context), it would need to be expressed differently for clarity.
1	The sentence "Alessandro took part in the party" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement and word usage rules.
1	The sentence "Francesco annotò la lezione." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense for past actions with regular -<u>ó</u> ending verbs in Italian language.
1	The sentence "Leonardo prende imbarco sulla nave" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian verb conjugation for third person singular (Leonardo takes) and uses proper syntax.
1	The sentence "Paola prese informazioni su Alessandro." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, we have the subject "Paola" who takes information about someone named "Alessandro". Both subjects and verbs must agree in number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine). In this case, since "Paola" is singular and female, the verb form "prese" also agrees with her as it indicates that she took something. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Edoardo si innamorò di Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. Here, the past tense third-person singular form of the reflexive verb "innamorarsi" (to fall in love) agrees with its subject "Edoardo," while the preposition "di" introduces the object of his affection, "Sofia."
0	The verb "prendere" should be conjugated as "prende" to agree with the singular subject "Paola". Also, it is not idiomatic to say that someone took a hatred for another person; instead, one can take a dislike or develop a grudge against someone. So, a grammatically correct and more natural way of expressing this idea would be: "Paola prese una antipatia per Tommaso."
0	The correct form of the verb should be used based on the subject. In this case, "gli uccelli" is plural, so the correct form of the verb to use would be "si imbeccano", not "si imbeccono". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence is "Gli uccelli si imbeccano dalla madre."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of "take" (took) has been used correctly to indicate that the action occurred at a specific point in time in the past. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent as "Maria," which is singular, pairs with the third person singular form of the verb "prese."
1	The sentence "Maria si prese il gioco di Lorenzo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between words. Here, "si prese" is the reflexive form of the verb "prendere", which agrees with the singular subject "Maria". Similarly, the definite article "il" before "gioco" matches the masculine gender of the noun, and "di Lorenzo" correctly specifies ownership. Therefore, this sentence is acceptable as written.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo is the first in the race." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and uses proper punctuation and capitalization.
1	The sentence "Francesco prese il coltello per la lama" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, "prese" is the third person singular past tense form of the verb "prendere," which agrees with the subject "Francesco." Additionally, "il coltello" (the knife) is correctly gendered as masculine and paired with the definite article "il." Lastly, "per la lama" (for the blade) uses the correct preposition "per" to indicate purpose or direction. Therefore, there are no errors or inconsistencies that would make this phrase grammatically incorrect.
1	The sentence "Leonardo fece il proprio danno" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses the past tense of the verb "fare". Additionally, "il proprio dama" correctly agrees with the masculine gender and singular number of "Leonardo."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo has taken fools for wise men" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with subject-verb agreement and proper use of tense. In this case, "has taken" is used correctly as the third person singular present perfect verb form to indicate that Lorenzo performed an action (took) at an unspecified past time and completed the action before now. Additionally, the noun phrase "fools for wise men" uses figurative language known as synecdoche where a part represents the whole or vice versa, which is acceptable in formal writing.
1	The sentence "Maria fece una seduta di elioterapia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. Here, the past tense of the verb "fare" (to make or to do) agrees with its singular feminine subject "Maria", and appears before the direct object "una seduta di elioterapia". Therefore, this sentence can be considered acceptable as written.
1	The sentence "Andrea took the train." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb (took) agrees with its singular subject (Andrea). Additionally, all other words are correctly used and placed within the sentence making it easy to understand.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used according to the subject. In this case, "this redazione" is singular and requires the third person singular form "è", instead of the plural form "sono". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be: "È stato perso troppo tempo il treno, in questa redazione."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement or word usage. The past tense "fu" agrees with the singular subject "la bussola," and "persa" correctly describes the action taken upon the object of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The sentence communicates a clear idea and the words flow smoothly without any awkward constructions.
1	The sentence "Edoardo può venire con noi?" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the correct form of the present tense of the verb "potere" (can) which agrees with the subject "Edoardo", and it asks if he can join us, using question intonation at the end of the sentence.
0	The verb "mettere" requires the auxiliary verb "ha" instead of "mise". Also, there is no object for the action of putting. A possible correction could be: "Tommaso mise il giudizio nel suo rapporto." (Translation: "Tommaso put the judgment in his report.")
0	The verb "disse" should be in the third person singular form "dice", because its subject is "Lorenzo". Also, there must be an article before "due". So the correct sentence is: "Lorenzo le dice di averne dati due a Maria."
1	The sentence "Beatrice took fools for jars" is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past tense verb "took", followed by the subject "Beatrice" and two noun phrases used metaphorically as objects "fools" and "jars". This sentence might be an example of personification or idiomatic expression.
1	The sentence "Tommaso butta olio sul fuoco." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and all the words are used correctly according to their conjugations and functions in the sentence. In this case, there are no errors or inconsistencies that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence "Riccardo tirò l'acqua al proprio mulino" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. The subject-verb agreement is respected (Riccardo is singular and tirò is third person singular), and the preposition "al" followed by the definite article "proprio" correctly indicates possession. Additionally, the use of the past tense ("tirò") accurately conveys that this action occurred in the past.
1	The sentence "Alessandro si diede la zappa sui piedi." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, there are no apparent errors or inconsistencies with verb conjugations, word order, or agreement between subject and predicate. Therefore, we can assume that the sentence is acceptable for communication purposes.
1	The sentence "Emma ascolta un disco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and grammar structure.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha toccato Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha" (the third person singular form of "have") agrees with its plural subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the word order and tense are also appropriate for this simple statement in Italian.
1	The sentence "Riccardo fa le traduzioni dei bollettini di guerra." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. Here, "Riccardo" (subject) agrees with the third person singular present tense form of the verb "fare", which is "fa". Additionally, there are no apparent errors in word choice or word order that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "ridere" is the third person singular conjugation of the verb "ridere," which means "to laugh." Therefore, it agrees with its subject "te" (you).
1	The sentence "Tommaso legge." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "legge" (which means "reads" in English) agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso". Additionally, all other elements of the sentence appear to be correctly used and placed.
1	The sentence "Gabriele fa una telefonata a Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and uses the appropriate singular form of the verb "fare" (fa) to match the singular subject "Gabriele". Additionally, the preposition "a" is used correctly before the indirect object "Maria", indicating that she is the recipient of the phone call.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "dà" agrees with the subject "Tommaso", which is singular and third person. Additionally, the indirect object "Maria" correctly uses the preposition "a". Therefore, it is a complete and correct sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, we have two independent clauses "Che Andrea abbia telefonato" and "ha causato il fatto che Giulia sia ritornata". Both are connected by the conjunction "che", which introduces a relative clause. Additionally, the verb forms used correctly reflect the past tense (passato remoto) for both clauses.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and an action verb ("telefona"). Also, "ad" is correctly used as a preposition to indicate the indirect object of the action.
1	The sentence "Emma is struggling with her studies" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence where the subject comes before the verb and the predicate contains all other information about the action or state of being. In this case, "Emma" is the subject, "is" is the linking verb that connects the subject to its complement, and "struggling with her studies" is the complement describing what Emma is doing.
1	The sentence "Leonardo hates Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Leonardo"), verb ("hates") and object ("Maria"). Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated for their intended meaning and context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In the question "Leonardo odia Paola?" the verb "odia" (hates) agrees with its subject "Leonardo". Since "Leonardo" is singular, we use the third person singular form of the verb which is "odia" and not "odiano".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "andò" (went) agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro". Also, the article "il" before "padre" indicates that we are referring to one person only. Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake regarding subject-verb agreement, word order, or use of prepositions and conjunctions.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "The soldiers handed over the weapons to the prisoners."
1	The sentence "Alessandro ama i bignè" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing that someone likes something in Italian ([Name] + 'ama' + [object of affection]).

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in the use of tense, agreement, word choice or syntax. Therefore, it can be considered acceptable as it stands.

1	The sentence "Paola ha coraggio" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian sentences. In this case, the singular subject "Paola" agrees with the third person singular verb form "ha." Additionally, "coraggio" is an abstract noun that cannot be pluralized or take on a different conjugation based on number or gender.
1	The sentence "Gabriele seguono una rigida condotta morale" is grammatically incorrect because the subject of the sentence, "Gabriele", is singular and requires the third person singular form of the verb to be used, which is "segue". Therefore, the correct version would be "Gabriele segue una rigida condotta morale."
1	The sentence "La zanzara pratica una rigida condotta morale" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. All words are correctly conjugated and inflected according to their role in the sentence, and there are no apparent errors or typos that would make it difficult for a native speaker to understand.

1	The sentence "Tommaso dette gli schiaffi a Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the simple past tense (passato remoto). Here, the third person singular masculine form ("dette") of the verb "dare" agrees with its subject "Tommaso".

Overall, the structure and word choice are appropriate to convey a clear meaning without any apparent errors or awkwardness.
1	The sentence "Riccardo allungò uno schiaffo a Giulia." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the third person singular masculine (he) with the past tense of the reflexive verb "allungarsi" which means to stretch out or reach out, in this case referring to giving a slap.

1	The sentence "Riccardo resta in silenzio." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject, which agrees with the third-person singular verb form "reste," meaning "remains."

Overall, this sentence exhibits no syntactical errors and thus can be classified as grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non ha più sospetti su Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. Here, "non ha" is the negated form of the third-person singular present tense of the verb "avere," which means "to have." It agrees with its subject "Riccardo." Additionally, "più" functions as an adverb modifying "ha" to indicate that there are no longer any suspicions. Finally, "su Emma" is a prepositional phrase indicating what the suspictions were about. Overall, this sentence has proper word order, uses appropriate forms for each word, and conveys a complete thought.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo receives help from Edoardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses the appropriate verb tense to indicate that Lorenzo is currently receiving help.

1	The sentence "Riccardo procede al caricamento del camion di casse." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. Here, "procede" agrees with its subject "Riccardo," while "carica" (the singular form) agrees with its direct object "il camion".

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the red ink is the charge or function of the fountain pen.
1	The sentence "La stilografica è caricata" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax and verb agreement rules. Here, the singular subject "la stilografica" (the fountain pen) agrees with the third-person singular present tense of the verb "essere," which is "è." Additionally, the adjective "caricata" correctly agrees with its feminine gender and singular number. Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper usage of word order, verbs, and adjectives in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and there is a clear subject ("Tommaso") performing an action ("fruga") on a specific object ("i cassetti della scrivania di Giulia").
1	The sentence "Andrea carica l'orologio." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian format for forming sentences with proper subject-verb agreement and accurate tense use. In this case, "Andrea" (the subject) matches well with "carica" (third person singular form of the verb). Also, there are no obvious orthographic or syntactic errors to be found herein.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it uses the wrong form of the verb "to give." In this context, you should use "gives" instead of "dà". Also, note that referring to violence against animals in such a way may be considered inappropriate or offensive.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that Lorenzo runs up the stairs again.
1	The sentence "Beatrice has the task of kidnapping Emma" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense and agreement.
0	The correct form of the verb should be "corre" (third person singular) instead of "corrono" (third person plural), because the subject is "Alessandro", which is singular. Also, the article before "asina" must agree with the gender and number of the noun, so it should be "la asina" or just "l'asina".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Francesco" takes the object "il cervo" with "per le corna", indicating possession or control over the deer. Then, it uses the verb "attraversa" to indicate that he brings down the deer. All of these elements are used correctly according to Italian syntax rules.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "il frigorifero." Since "frigorifero" is masculine singular, it should be "il frigorifero ha," not "il frrigorifero ha." Additionally, "sedurre" is not an appropriate verb to use for a refrigerator and cat relationship. A more suitable word might be "attracted" or "interested".
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "il frigorifero" (the refrigerator) must be in the singular form and match with the verb "ha", which also needs to be in its third person singular form "ha" instead of "hanno". Additionally, the verb "adulterare" or "ingannare" would be more appropriate than "sedurre" for this context. A possible correction could be: "Il frigorifero ha ingannato a qualcuno con il suo falso display di freschezza."
1	The sentence "Riccardo has seduced a minor" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees in number with the subject (in this case, "Riccardo" is singular and therefore requires the third person singular form of the verb "has"). Additionally, all the words are correctly spelled and used appropriately for the intended meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. There are no errors or awkward phrasings that need to be corrected. "Tutta" means "all of it", so the singular form "applaudì" (third person plural past tense of "applaudire") should be used with "la sala," which refers to the single room being discussed.
1	The sentence "Paola has read a book" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with subject-verb agreement (third person singular) and appropriate tense usage for past actions completed by the subject.
0	The correct form of the verb "collect" should be used according to the subject. In this case, it should be "colleagues" instead of "colletto". Also, there is a misspelling of the word "love", it should be "lettori" if you are referring to tickets for readers or "amorosi" if you are referring to love letters. So, the sentence could be either "Maria collects love letters" or "Maria raccoglie i lettori".
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha tosato lo zio" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order and uses the correct past participle form of the verb "tosare" (to shave). In this case, "ha tosato" is used correctly as the third person singular masculine for present perfect tense, while "lo zio" serves as the direct object.
1	The sentence "Paola fa una corsa in giardino." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects and objects. In this case, "fa" agrees with its singular subject "Paola", and "corsa" is the object that takes the feminine singular article "una". Additionally, prepositions like "in" must be followed by an appropriate article or noun as demonstrated here with "giardino".
1	The sentence "Riccardo scambia libri con Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and uses proper conjugations for both verbs based on their subjects. Here, "scambia" (meaning exchanges or swaps) agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo," while the preposition "con" indicates that he is doing this action together with another person, specifically named as "Maria." Therefore, there are no apparent errors or issues making this phrase acceptable according to Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Alice has furrowed her brow" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with its singular or plural subject in number and person. In this case, the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "to have," which is "has," agrees with its singular subject "Alice." Additionally, every word seems to be used correctly according to their meaning and function in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Maria ha curvato la faccia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses the correct conjugated form of the verb "curvare". In this case, "ha curvato" agrees with the third person singular subject "Maria", indicating that she performed the action of curving something (in this case, "la faccia").
1	The sentence "Sofia maintains head to the enemy" is grammatically correct because all of its components are used appropriately according to English syntax and morphology rules. However, it might not convey the intended meaning clearly as maintaining one's head to someone could have multiple interpretations. In this context, if the desired meaning is that Sofia keeps her focus on the opponent during a fight or competition, then a more appropriate way to express this idea would be "Sofia keeps her eyes on the enemy" or "Sofia stays focused on the enemy."
1	The sentence "Alessandro si gonfia la testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for word order and verb agreement in Italian. In this case, "si gonfia" is the third-person singular conjugation of the reflexive verb "gonfiarsi," which agrees with the subject "Alessandro." Additionally, the direct object pronoun "la" correctly refers to the noun "testa."
0	The correct form of the verb "to leave" should be used after "ha". In this case, it should be "lasciato", so the grammatically correct sentence is "Beatrice l'ha lasciata." (Beatrice left her.)
1	The sentence "Capire le intenzioni segrete di una persona" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence (subject + verb + object) and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective number and gender.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "cambia", and the verb is correctly conjugated in the third person singular present tense ("cambia"). Additionally, the object of the sentence "le carte" also agrees with the subject in number (both are plural).
0	The correct form of the verb "fare" should be used after "cattivo". It should be "fa male", not "fa a male". Also, there is no need for an article before "gioco". So, the grammatically correct sentence would be "Riccardo fa male il gioco."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses the verb "ha" with two subjects ("Andrea" and "Beatrice"). A correct version of this sentence could be "Andrea ha rotto il collo a Beatrice" or "Andrea e Beatrice hanno rotto il collo (to each other)".
0	The verb "rompere" should be conjugated as "rompono", since the subject of the sentence is plural ("la musica rock"). A better way to phrase this would be: "La musica rock può sembrare forte per le orecchie."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the use of tense, agreement, word choice or syntax. However, it might be contextually confusing since both subjects share the same name "Tommaso", but this does not make the sentence incorrect from a purely grammatical perspective.
1	The sentence "La mosca salta al naso di Riccardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here are some reasons why this statement is true: - Word order: In Italian, word order usually follows the pattern subject-verb-object (SVO). This sentence has a clear subject ("la mosca"), verb ("salta") and object ("al naso di Riccardo"). - Gender agreement: The feminine singular definite article "la" agrees with the gender and number of the noun "mosca". Similarly, the third person singular present tense form of the verb "salta" matches the subject. - Prepositional phrase: The preposition "di" introduces the possessive modifier "Riccardo", indicating whose nose the fly jumps to. Overall, there are no apparent errors or violations of standard Italian language conventions, making this sentence grammatically acceptable.
0	The verb "andare" should be conjugated to match the subject of the sentence. In this case, since the subject is "monte," which is singular and masculine, the correct form of the verb would be "va." So the grammatically correct version of the phrase would be "Monte va."
0	The phrase "Being at the index" is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb tense and subject-verb agreement. A possible correction could be "I am at the index."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Putting" is the present participle of the verb "to put", which is used here to form the progressive tense. In this case, it indicates an action that is currently happening or ongoing.
1	The sentence "Alzare il gomito" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian format for commands and includes a verb ("alzare") and its direct object ("il gomito"). Additionally, the verb agrees with the subject (implied as "you"), which is also appropriate for this type of command form.
1	The sentence "Perdere il lume della ragione" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and agreement between words. In this case, "perdere" (to lose) agrees with its subject "il lume" (the light), while "la ragione" (reason) is correctly used as the object of the preposition "di". Additionally, the word order is correct for a declarative sentence in Italian.
0	The verb "to cavort" should be used instead of the noun form "the castagnes." Additionally, there is no preposition or object for the phrasal verb "cavar out," making the sentence grammatically incorrect. A possible correction could be: "To cavort (or rescue) someone from trouble."
0	The correct phrase is "essere poveri in canna," not "essere povero in canna." In this case, the adjective "poveri" must agree with its noun "gli uomini" (which has been omitted from the sentence but is implied), so it needs to be plural.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("l'angelo custode") and a predicate ("accompagna..."), and uses proper verb agreement for third person singular. Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and punctuated.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular form of the verb "has" to agree with its subject "ogni bambino". Also, the word "lo" correctly refers back to the nearby masculine singular noun "bambino".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard Italian syntax and verb agreement rules. "A quella festa" (to that party) is the destination of the obligation expressed by "è di rigore" (is required). "Lo smoking" (the tuxedo) is the subject that must be worn at that event.
0	The verb "nuotare" (to swim) should be used with subjects that can swim, like animals or people. In this case, the subject is "moto", which cannot swim. A correct sentence could be "La bicicletta di Leonardo è lucidata a nuovo." (Leonardo's bicycle has been polished anew).
1	The sentence "I saw a unit marching" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees in number with the subject. In this case, the singular subject "a unit" matches with the singular verb "was." Additionally, the use of the present participle "marching" correctly describes an ongoing action in the past tense using the auxiliary verb "had seen," which is not shown here but implied by the structure of the sentence.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" does not agree with the verb form "ritorni". It should be "Che Leonardo ritorni PIACIA a Maria." In this case, "piacere" requires that the infinitive follow it directly without any intervening words like "a".
1	The sentence "Sofia corre a mangiare" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "corre" (which means runs) agrees with its singular subject "Sofia". Additionally, the preposition "a" followed by an infinitive verb ("mangiare") indicates purpose or intention to eat after running.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "Andrea" is the one performing the action of smiling, and "Sofia" is the recipient of that action. Therefore, there is no need for any changes to be made to the sentence.
1	The sentence "Beatrice makes sure the article is clear" is grammatically correct because all of its components are used appropriately according to English language rules. Here, "Beatrice" is the subject and "makes sure" is the verb phrase that describes her action. Furthermore, "the" is correctly used as a definite article before "article," which functions as the direct object receiving Beatrice's action.

Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
0	The correct phrase should be "This is what it looks like" instead of "Ciò guarda questa cosa". The word "ciò" means "this", but its usage here is incorrect and not idiomatic.

1	The sentence "La spugna pulisce" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple Italian sentence (Subject + Verb) and uses the correct form of the verb "pulire". In this case, "la spugna" is the subject and "pulisce" is the third-person singular present tense of the verb "pulire", which means "to clean".
0	The correct phrase should use the article "the" before "bitter tea," as it is a specific type of tea being referred to. Also, there should not be a space before the punctuation marks at the end of the sentence. A grammatically correct version would be: "Tutti bevono il te bitter."
