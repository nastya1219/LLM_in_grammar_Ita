0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it lacks the verb "to want" or its contraction "want to." A correct version of this sentence would be "I want to greet Julia."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses the desire of the speaker to greet Sophia.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the determiner "my" must agree with its noun "Divina Commedia" in number and gender. In this case, it should be "la mia", since "Commedia" is feminine singular in Italian.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it combines two different types of nouns - a type of train and a literary work. It should be clear what the preferred "train" or the preferred "book to read on the train" is referring to.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" matches with the verb "ha detto", and the relative clause "Andrea has spoken with Riccardo" also has a correct structure.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" is the subject of the sentence and the present progressive tense verb phrase "is elaborating" correctly describes what Andrea is doing right now.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two simple sentences connected by a period. In the first simple sentence "Alessandro has met", we have the subject "Alessandro" and the auxiliary verb "has". In the second simple sentence "Giulia.", we just have the subject "Giulia". Both subjects are singular nouns so there isn't any agreement error between them and their verbs.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è ricomparsa" agrees with its singular subject "il padre." Additionally, the past participle of the verb agrees with the gender and number of the noun it refers to ("il ragazzo").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "prices" agrees with the verb "are increased." Additionally, the word order and tense are also appropriate for this simple declarative statement.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "given" agrees with the subject "Andrea and I," and it is correctly used in this context to indicate that both parties were willingly engaging in an enjoyable activity together. Additionally, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of subject-verb-object and the verb "is" agrees with the singular subject "il palazzo delle assurance". Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb. In this case, "that" should be replaced with a verb to form a complete thought. For example, the corrected sentence could read: "That construction offends my sense of aesthetics."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object and all words are used appropriately according to their intended meanings. In this case, "Newton" serves as the subject that performs an action denoted by the verb "has explained," which affects the object "the force of gravity."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "si è danneggiato". Additionally, the word order and syntax are also proper.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "quegli uomini" agrees with the verb "hanno denunciato," and the reflexive pronoun "se stessi" correctly refers back to the subject of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "I" is implied and understood from context, making the verb agree with it in singular form ("compro"). Additionally, "leggo" agrees with its direct object "quel libro", which is also third person singular masculine.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains a complete thought and the subject-verb agreement is consistent as "ho" appropriately agrees with its singular subject "I". Additionally, the comma separates the two independent clauses correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence "The cat is on the mat." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. The subject "cat" agrees with its verb "is," as both are singular; and the adpositional phrase "on the mat" correctly modifies the location of "the cat."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for introducing oneself to a group of people who are associated with another person. In this case, "Ho" serves as the subject pronoun and auxiliary verb, while "incontrato" is the past participle form of the verb "incontrare," indicating that the action has been completed. The phrase "molti amici di Riccardo" functions as the object of the sentence, which receives the action of having been met by the speaker. Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order. "Non" is used as a negation, which is placed before the verb. The object of the sentence "tuo libro" comes after the verb. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject "I", a verb "have" that agrees with the subject, and an object "homework". Additionally, there are two prepositional phrases "in this room" and "on the table." All of these elements form a complete thought making the sentence semantically correct as well.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Riccardo" is the subject of the main clause and it is in the third person singular form ("ha"). * "che" introduces a subordinate clause where "metterà" is the verb. Since the subject of this clause is not explicitly mentioned but we can infer that it refers to "Riccardo", we use the third person singular form again. * Both clauses are linked by the conjunction "that". * There are no missing or extra words, and all agreements between subjects and verbs are respected.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "Maria" agrees with the verb "has saluted," and the object "his parents" correctly follows the verb phrase. Additionally, the possessive pronoun "his" matches the gender of the singular noun it modifies, "parents."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "è" and the degree adverb "molto" correctly modifies the adjective "intelligent".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Credo" is used correctly as a conjunction here to link the two clauses. It indicates that the speaker doubts or is unsure about Riccardo's intelligence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence "They" clearly refers to multiple people who called many people at that number as indicated by the phrase "molte persone." There are no errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Riccardo" and a verb "ha comprato". The word order follows the rules of Italian syntax. There are no morphological or semantic errors either. Therefore, this sentence can be considered entirely acceptable from a linguistic perspective.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "was met" agrees with the direct object pronoun "him", and the subject of the sentence "Andrea" is also in agreement with the verb tense used.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the word order is incorrect. In Italian, questions are usually formed by changing the word order and adding a question particle like "che" or "chi". A possible correction could be: "Riccardo ha chiesto chi aveva visto Leonardo." This means "Riccardo asked who had seen Leonardo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order for third person singular subjects with future tense verbs. "Leonardo" is the subject, and "has been told" serves as an introductory phrase that sets up the expectation of who will speak tomorrow.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb tense to indicate when the subject "Gabriele" saw something or someone. A possible correction could be "Gabriele, when did you see him?" or "Gabriele, when have you seen him?" depending on the intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Here, "Leonardo" is the subject, "has put" is the verb and "the papers" is the object. Additionally, the preposition "in" is used correctly with its object "which drawer."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks an appropriate form of the verb "to be" to link the subject and the predicate. Also, there should be an article before "politico". A possible correction could be: "Which politician did they speak about?"
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically incorrect but it is semantically problematic because of the multiple layers of indirect speech and reference to an unspecified politician and judge making it difficult to understand its meaning clearly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for simple sentences in English. The subject "Lorenzo" agrees with the verb "has said," and the dependent clause "that he will leave tomorrow" provides additional information about what Lorenzo stated.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming a simple sentence with a compound subject and a dependent clause. "Francesco" and "we" are the subjects of the sentence, while "has arrived" serves as the verb phrase. The conjunction "when" introduces the dependent time clause, which describes when the action of the main clause occurred.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules and has no morphological or semantic errors. "La tempesta" is the subject of the sentence, "ha abbattuto" is the verb, and "la quercia sotto cui il figliol prodigo pascolava i porci" is the object. All words are used appropriately according to their meaning, and there are no misspellings or incorrect tense usage.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense and agreement between subject and verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. "Alessandro, who came to visit me yesterday, told me to greet you."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses appropriate verb tense ("ritiene" in this case). Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object and the verb "is" agrees with its subject "the fear". Additionally, all words are used appropriately according to their meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "ha perso", and the object "le chiavi" also matches the gender and number of the pronoun "le". Additionally, word order follows standard Italian syntax rules for declarative sentences.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" matches with the singular verb form "è". Additionally, the adjective "bramoso" agrees in number and gender with the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "I" which is implied and not stated explicitly, the verb "think", an object "Francesco asking the time to Lorenzo" and its sub-components - "Francesco", "the time", and "Lorenzo". All of these components are arranged correctly according to English syntax rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" matches with the singular verb form "ha affermato", and the subordinate clause has consistent tense and number agreement between its components.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Io" which means "I" in English) and an independent clause with the verb in the past tense ("ho sempre sostenuto", meaning "have always supported"). Additionally, there is a subordinate conjunction ("anche se") introducing a dependent clause that provides a reason for the action of the main clause. Finally, the sentence ends with the infinitive phrase "votare contro questa proposa" which functions as the complement to the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for each subject. "Tommaso" is singular so we use "ha" to indicate present perfect tense, while "Andrea" is also singular so we use "di" before an infinitive verb form ("difendere") to create the causative construction.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an interrogative sentence with a subject ("who") and a verb ("thinks"). The word "Alessandro" functions as the object of the verb "will meet."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past participle "seduto" agrees with the subject of the sentence ("la sedia") and the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, there are no semantic or morphological errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("this is the person"), a verb ("is"), and an attributive clause that modifies the noun phrase "the person" ("with whom Eduardo made the statement that Thomas spoke"). All elements are used correctly to form a complex but coherent sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the word "chi" should be "that" or "who". Also, there should be a form of to have after the subject ("Sofia"), but it is missing from the sentence. A possible correction could be: "Edoardo believes that Sofia has kissed someone."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the sentence "I am learning to play the guitar."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the past tense of the verb "to see" should be "saw," not "have seen." The auxiliary verb "have" is unnecessary and incorrectly conjugated in this context. A grammatically correct version would be "I saw him."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the definite article "the" should agree with its following singular noun "lo", so it should be "il". A possible correction could be: "Abbiamo visto il." or "We have seen it.", assuming that there was an intended reference to something previously mentioned and identified as masculine singular.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" matches with the verb "dice", and it also includes an adverbial clause of time "domani". Additionally, there is another dependent clause "che Alessandro parlerà" which contains its own subject-verb agreement as well. Therefore, this sentence does not have any errors regarding morphology, syntax or semantics, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the reflexive pronoun "se stessa" does not match with the subject "Beatrice". Also, the verb form "ha" after "if" should be changed to "have", and the auxiliary verb "had" should be used instead of "has" for consistency. A corrected version would be: "Beatrice declared that she didn't have anything to do with Gabriele."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Riccardo"), an auxiliary verb ("ha detto"), and the object of the indirect speech ("che Andrea si è guardato"). All words are used correctly according to their function within the sentence, making it grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and the structure of the sentence follows standard English syntax rules. "Il" is a possessive adjective agreeing with the masculine singular noun "padre", while "Andrea" serves as its antecedent. The verb "è" agrees with the subject "il padre di Andrea". The phrase "mi è sembrato" functions as an impersonal expression here which does not affect the number agreement between the subject and the main verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the structure of reported speech and has consistent verb tense usage throughout the sentence. Each clause correctly identifies who believes or wants what action to be taken by whom, making the overall meaning clear and coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the structure of the sentence follows English syntax rules and all words are used correctly according to their meaning. Additionally, the verb "believe" agrees with its subject "Edoardo," and each clause has a clear subject and verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the rabbit" agrees with the verb "eats," and the word order follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it contains an incorrect relative pronoun "that" instead of the subject relative pronoun "which." Also, there should be no word "of" between "about" and the book title. A correct version could be: "Which book does the professor recommend reading about?" or "What book does the professor recommend that we read about?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("I") and an verb ("arrived"). "Me" is used correctly as the object of the preposition "by." Overall, this sentence conveys a clear meaning about who arrived first between two people.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "un uomo" agrees with the singular verb "arriva". Also, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules. Additionally, there are no semantic errors or morphological issues that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" matches with the singular verb form "uccise," and the object of the sentence "Andrea" is also grammatically correct as it is used appropriately after the transitive verb "uccise."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject of the sentence "Andrea" is followed by the appropriate verb tense "has said", and the object "that Tommaso looks at him" correctly uses the pronoun "him" to refer back to the subject "Andrea".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject "Gabriele" is singular and the verb "ha" agrees with it. Also, the prepositional phrase "di andare al mare" provides more information about what Gabriele wants. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the given sentence. "Questo" refers to the book and serves as the subject of the sentence while "that I had never read" modifies "this."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there should be a question mark at the end instead of a period. Also, it would sound more natural to say "Has that professor already questioned Tommaso?" or "Has Tommaso been questioned by that professor yet?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "crede", and the pronoun "we" correctly refers to "Alessandro and others". Additionally, the subordinate clause "that we will invade that country" contains the appropriate verb tense for a future event based on Alessandro's belief about it.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it lacks the subject-auxiliary inversion needed for forming indirect questions with auxiliaries other than "do", "does" and "did". In this case, the word "crede" should be before "Andrea", so the corrected sentence would be: "About those countries, which does Andrea think will invade?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics. "L'anno" means "the year", which refers to a specific time period in the past; "scriveva" is the imperfect tense of "scrivere" that indicates an ongoing action in the past; "ma" introduces a contrasting idea; "tutt'oggi" means "to this day" or "still today"; "non l'ha ancora finito" uses the present perfect tense to indicate an action started in the past but not yet completed. Overall, the sentence describes how Alexander was writing a book last year but hasn't finished it yet.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("l'anno scorso, Edoardo") and predicate ("scrisse un libro, ma a tutt'oggi non l'ha ancora finito"). There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make the sentence incorrect.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it contains a contradiction. A person cannot be both single and married at the same time.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the current king of France" is singular and agrees with the verb "is". Additionally, the predicate adjective "calvo" correctly describes the noun it modifies, the current king of France.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the given sentence "Qualche studente ha superato l'esame."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. This is because the subject and verb agree in number - "some students" is plural and so is "have". Also, the use of "then" correctly links the two clauses together to show that one thing follows logically from another.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. "I" refers to the subject who made a promise and "Lorenzo" is the indirect object of the sentence with "to" indicating his role as an indirect object. "Part" is the verb that describes what was promised. Overall, the structure and meaning of this sentence make it acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of subject-verb-object and uses proper tense for the action that took place in the past. In this case, "the court" is the subject, "declared" is the verb, and "the defendant innocent" is the object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a clear subject ("I"), verb ("will"), and object ("them"). Additionally, "they" agrees in number with its antecedent "those guys."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" matches with the verb "have taken." The past tense of take agrees with the first-person singular pronoun. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The indirect speech is used correctly to convey the message of the marchioness. Good job!
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "una bella casa" agrees with the verb "fa," both being singular and third person. Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules for declarative sentences.
1	Correct	The sentence "She writes him letters every day." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax, and semantics. The subject "she" agrees with the verb "writes," which is in third person singular present tense. Additionally, the objects "him" and "letters" are correctly placed after the verb. Finally, the temporal expression "every day" provides additional information about the frequency of her letter-writing habit.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the form of the verb should be "use" instead of "uso". In English, verbs must agree with their subjects in number and person, so when using the first-person singular pronoun "I", we need to use the base form of the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular form of the verb "funziona" which agrees with the subject "il calcolatore".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules and has appropriate verb tense agreement between the subject "I" and the verb "am." The use of the contraction "I'm" is also acceptable for informal contexts.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Le" is the plural feminine definite article in Italian and it agrees with "ragazze". "Sono" means "are" in English and it also agrees with "ragazze", which is plural. Therefore, there are no morphological or syntactical errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. The subject "The book that Lorenzo lent me" agrees with the verb "doesn't like," which is in the negative form to indicate that the speaker does not enjoy reading the borrowed book. Additionally, the tense of the verb is consistent with the time frame of the action. Overall, there are no semantic or syntactic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "dicono" does not agree with its subject "they." In English, this error would be like saying "They say she don't understand," which violates subject-verb agreement rules. To fix it, replace "dicono" with "dice": "Dice che hai raccontato che non ci vediamo mai."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("He") and a verb ("reads"). Additionally, "legge" is the correct conjugation for the third person singular present tense of the Italian verb "leggere," which means "to read."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a clear subject and the verb "have" does not agree with the implied subject ("I"). A possible correction could be: "I was going home and I met your brother."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" matches with the verb "am going," both of which are in singular form. Additionally, the infinitive phrase "to pick up the car" follows correctly after the main clause.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not semantically correct because the metaphor comparing physical places to human faces does not make logical or meaningful sense. Places and human faces are fundamentally different entities with distinct characteristics that cannot be compared directly in this manner.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb, which is necessary for a complete sentence. In this case, the command "Go home!" should be directed at someone specific, and there should be a subject before the verb ("You" can be implied). So, a grammatically correct version of this sentence could be "You go home!" or "You va' home!" if addressing someone familiar with the informal Italian imperative form.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the adjective "affamato" to match with the singular subject "Io". In English, this would translate to "I am hungry", which follows similar rules for agreement between the subject and its accompanying word.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English sentence structure of subject-verb-object and all words are used appropriately for their intended meaning. Additionally, the use of punctuation is also appropriate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "Paola" is the subject, "è" is the appropriate verb for singular third person, and "una donna che apprezziamo molto" is a relative clause modifying the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for forming questions and uses appropriate verb tense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject of the sentence "I" has seen the direct object "the book" which was given by an implied second person pronoun.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is no verb that connects the subject "friends" and the prepositional phrase "whose master is Andrea". A possible correction could be "The friends whose master is Andrea." or "Friends of mine have a master named Andrea.", depending on what exactly you want to convey with this statement.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "credo" agrees with its singular subject "tu", and the adverb "già" is correctly used to indicate that something has happened before or earlier than expected.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the past participle "caduto" should agree with its subject "esso", but instead of "-o" it needs to have "-o/-a" ending which indicates masculine singular gender and masculine or feminine singular number, respectively. In this case, since "esso" is masculine singular, the correct form would be "caduto". However, if we wanted to use an impersonal pronoun such as "si", then we could say "Si è fatto male dopo essersi buttato giù."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of subject-verb agreement and includes appropriate verb tense usage to indicate past actions completed by multiple subjects ("they") on one object ("her" or "it").
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "take" should be in its plural form "take" instead of singular "takes". In this case, it would be "Each takes their own coat", but that still has an issue with pronoun agreement ("their" refers to multiple people). A better version could be "Everyone takes his or her own coat."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the imperative form of the verb "take" does not require any inflection and it can be followed by a direct object without using any pronouns like "it".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for the past tense ("ho dato" becomes "have given" in English passive voice).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject-verb agreement is maintained and there are no obvious errors in morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" agrees with the verb "have," and the object "house" correctly follows the transitive verb "have." Additionally, the article "a" precedes the noun "house" appropriately as it has not been previously mentioned.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have seen your mother" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and has proper word order.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the relative pronoun "that" has been omitted after the noun phrase "the person," which refers to an individual who spoke with the speaker. This type of ellipsis is acceptable and commonly used in English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject "uno" and a predicate "va in treno, vuole stare comodo". The verb "va" agrees with the singular subject "uno", so there are no morphological errors. The word order is also correct, which means that there are no syntactic errors. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear, indicating an absence of semantic errors.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "cavalli" agrees with the verb "sono" and the meaning of the sentence is clear and coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that someone has arrived.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English declarative sentence with a subject ("It") and a verb ("has arrived"). There are no obvious morphological, syntactic or semantic errors that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "can" agrees with its singular subject "I".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses the idea that it might rain tomorrow. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "he" matches with the singular verb "has been caught." Additionally, the past participle form of the verb "to catch" agrees with the auxiliary verb "has been," which further confirms that the sentence structure and tense are appropriate for this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("he") and a verb ("writes"). There are no apparent morphological, syntactic or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Egli" is a third-person singular masculine pronoun which means "he," and "lo" is an indirect object pronoun meaning "him." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "He saw him."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of the words are used appropriately.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "has." Additionally, the adverb "not" correctly modifies the verb phrase "has time," and there are no other obvious errors in word choice or agreement.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects "they" and "the book" agree in number with their corresponding verbs "have opened" and "opened." Additionally, the word order follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "He gave her the hat" instead of "Le è stato dato il cappello da me". In English, gender pronouns are typically used for people being referred to, but in this case, "le" and "gli" are gendered direct object pronouns that would replace a specific noun in Italian. However, using these gendered forms does not make sense with the subject "he," so we need to use an objective form such as "her."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "quel ragazzo" agrees with the verb "apre" in number and tense. Additionally, the object of the preposition "la" correctly follows the preposition "apre".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple present tense sentence with the subject "I" and the verb "have heard."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks proper agreement between the subject and the verb. It should be "The machine wants to wash it" instead of "La macchina vuole lavarla lui". In this corrected version, both "the machine" and "wants" agree in number, as well as "it" and "lavarlo", which are all singular.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the singular subject "the mechanic" matches with the third person singular present tense verb form "has." Additionally, the auxiliary verb "is" agrees with the subject and helps to form the perfect aspect of the verb phrase.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "È" is used as an auxiliary verb to form the negative construction with "venire". In this case, it agrees in number and gender with the noun "Napoli", which is feminine singular.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "fa" should be conjugated as "fanno" to agree with the subject "il bagno." In English, this would translate to "As for the bathroom, they please me," but it sounds strange and unnatural even in Italian. A more natural way of expressing this idea might be "Il bagno è gradito" or "Mi piace il bagno".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a noun phrase ("Having dinner with Lorenzo") that functions as the object of the verb "enjoy." The subject of the sentence is implied to be "I" or another singular entity.

1	Correct	The sentence "Do you think something like that is possible?" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming questions with auxiliary verbs and subject-verb agreement. Additionally, all words are used appropriately according to their meaning, making the sentence semantically correct as well.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Il vento" agrees with the verb "può" and all other elements of the sentence are used appropriately according to their syntactic function.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the adverb "forte" needs an ending that agrees with the verb it modifies in number and gender. In this case, since "piangere" is a third person singular verb that ends in "-e", the corresponding adverb should end in "-emente". So, the grammatically correct form of the sentence would be "Piangere fortemente."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. There is no error in morphology, syntax or semantics.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "tutte le balene" agrees with the verb "devono essere", and the meaning of the sentence is clear and coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the imperative mood to give a command and follows its subject "you" with an appropriate verb form "put."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because the adjectives "vecchia" and "nuova" are contradictory when referring to the same subject. A thing cannot be both old and new at the same time.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" has an agreement with the verb "conosce", and both are singular. Also, the object of the sentence "Maria" correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the government" matches with the verb "has abolished," and the object of the sentence, "the law," follows the verb as expected. Additionally, the tense is consistent throughout the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" matches with the verb "have brushed." The past tense of the verb "to brush" is "brushed," and it agrees with the singular first-person pronoun "I." Additionally, the object "the shoes" follows the proper order after the verb.

0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb. In this case, "emanate" should be used instead of just "emanare". Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is incorrect as well since there is no clear singular or plural subject in the sentence. A possible correction could be: "The flower emanates a pleasant scent."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there should be a subject and a verb to form a complete thought. In this case, the subject and verb are missing which makes it incomplete and incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a clear subject ("I"), verb ("am starting"), and object ("an activity"). There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make the sentence incorrect.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject ("Le scarpe" - singular) agrees with the verb tense ("si sono macchiate" - past participle). Also, the adjective "macchiate" agrees in number and gender with the noun "scarpe".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Le" is the plural feminine definite article in Italian and agrees with "giornate". "Si" refers to reflexive agreement for third person plural subjects like "le giornate", so "si sono" means "have become shorter."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Qualcosa" agrees with the singular verb "ha accorciato." Additionally, the past participle "accorciato" agrees with its helper verb "ha," and both are in the correct tense to indicate that an action was completed in the past.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: the subject "Qualcuno" agrees with the singular verb form "ha accorciato," and the object "le giornate" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb. "Hang" should be used instead of "agrapparsi", which does not seem to be an English word. Additionally, the article "a" is unnecessary before "branch". A possible correction could be: "He hangs from a branch."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Arenate" is the past participle of the verb "arenare", which means to run aground or become stranded on a shore. Therefore, it agrees with the subject "navi". The second part of the sentence is also grammatically correct as "equipaggi" are plural and agree with the verb "sono scesi" which is correctly conjugated for third person plural subjects.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "has vanished" agrees with its subject "the fog" in number and tense.
0	Syntactically and semantically incorrect	The sentence is both syntactically and semantically incorrect because "sé" should be reflexive and match the subject "Alessandro", so it should be "se stesso". Also, crying is an action that cannot be performed on oneself involuntarily as stated by "always".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Predicate and all words are used appropriately according to their meaning and function.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a clear subject ("il figlio di Leonardo") and predicate ("sedeva in prima fila"). Additionally, the use of past tense "iniziò" correctly sets the scene for the rest of the action taking place during the concert.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because walls cannot grow mold "in a day." Walls become moldy over time due to moisture or other environmental factors. Therefore, the phrase "in a day" is semantically incorrect in this context as it suggests that the wall started growing mold very quickly, which is unlikely and misleading.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "sta suonando", and the object of the sentence, "un pezzo di Bach," follows standard Italian syntax rules for direct objects. Additionally, the tense used, present progressive, is appropriate for describing an ongoing action.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il coro" agrees with the verb "canta" in number and person, and the adverb "molto" correctly modifies the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "aspirava", and the object of the preposition "del" ("il fumo") correctly follows it.

Additionally, there are no semantic errors or inconsistencies in the meaning of the words used.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "ha acceso", and the object "il fuoco" follows standard Italian syntax rules. Additionally, the article "il" matches the gender of "fuoco". Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il" agrees with the singular verb "ha", and the phrase "in Canada" functions as an adverbial of place explaining where the action took place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "The lesson" is a singular noun that requires a third-person singular verb to agree with its number. Therefore, using "has continued" as the main verb is appropriate since it agrees with the subject "the lesson." Additionally, there are no semantic or logical errors in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is an imperative sentence with the verb "to jump" which tells someone to perform the action of jumping over an obstacle.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. All verbs must agree with their subjects in number and person. In this case, the subject "tutti" is plural, so the verb "si sono commossi" which also shows agreement in being plural, is used correctly to match the subject of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Si è macchiata la tovaglia." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "si" is a reflexive pronoun that agrees with the subject, which is implied but not explicitly stated. In English, this would be similar to saying "It has stained itself the tablecloth," where the subject is also implied. Additionally, the verb "è macchiata" agrees with the gender and number of the direct object "la tovaglia". Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper agreement between its elements, making it an acceptable statement in Italian.
0	Morphology	The form of the verb "macchiare" should be "macchia" when used with the singular subject "il vino". However, since we use it with a definite article, which is grammatically considered as masculine singular, the correct form for the verb must also agree in gender and number with this implied subject. Therefore, you need to say "Il vino lo macchia", where "lo" refers to the complement object and agrees in gender and number with "il vino."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with its subject "l'acqua," and the time expression "in two hours" correctly indicates that the freezing occurred within a duration of time rather than at a specific point in time.
0	Morphology	The verb "have" should be conjugated to match the past tense of the sentence; it should be "had." The corrected version would read, "The steps had burned for an hour."

Additionally, the direct object "le basette" follows the appropriate gender agreement for the adjective "basette".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules for simple sentences. Additionally, all of the words are used appropriately within their context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. While it might seem unusual to have two past participles ("calmato" and "irrigidito") directly following each other without an auxiliary verb or conjunction, this construction can be used for emphasis or to indicate that the actions happened simultaneously. In this case, it suggests that Francesco became both calm and stiff at the same time.
1	Correct	The sentence "Si è rotto il vetro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian simple sentence with the subject ("si", which refers to an impersonal or reflexive action) and the past participle verb form ("è rotto"). Additionally, "il vetro" as singular masculine noun agrees with the past participle form "rotto".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verbs "mangiate" and "bevuti" are missing their corresponding subjects. It should be "Venite alla festa e mangiate e bevute." or "Venite alla festa e poi mangiate e bevete."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular form of the verb "to be" ("is") to agree with its subject "the debate".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error present in the given sentence. It is constructed properly and has clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and "ha cancellato" is the conjugated verb that agrees with the singular subject. "La scritta" is the direct object of the sentence. All elements are syntactically related to each other correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "suona", and the tense of the verb is also appropriate for the present time. Additionally, the object "il telefono" correctly follows the verb.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Francesco" agrees with the verb "ha bruciato", and the direct object "la torta" also has the correct article "la" to agree with the gender of "torta".

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "il bosco" which is singular and agrees with the verb form "si è". Additionally, the duration expression "per tre ore" is correctly used to indicate that the action lasted for three hours.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "si è asciugata" agrees with its singular subject "la biancheria." Additionally, the verb tense and word order are also appropriate for expressing that the drying action happened in the past.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics. "Il" is a singular Italian masculine definite article that agrees with "libro," which is also singular and masculine; "è" is an auxiliary verb used to form the compound past tense in Italian, agreeing with "libro"; "sparito" is the past participle of the verb "sparire," meaning "to disappear." Overall, this part of the sentence means "The book had disappeared for three days". Then, "poi" introduces a temporal adverbial clause indicating sequence ("then"), followed by another auxiliary verb "è" and the past participle "ricomparsosul mio tavolo", forming the passive voice "had suddenly reappeared on my table". This whole phrase describes what happened after the first event took place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and the verb "si è ingrassato" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Riccardo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate tense and agreement between subjects and verbs.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires the verb "has" instead of "si è" to agree with the singular subject "television". Additionally, there should be an article before "hour." A possible correction would be: "The television broke in an hour."

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and the verb "approfita" agrees with its singular subject "Andrea". Additionally, the indirect object pronoun "di" before "Maria" correctly indicates that she is the recipient of the action performed by "Andrea."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the question lacks a proper word order and an explicit subject-verb agreement. In English, questions typically start with an auxiliary verb or a form of "to be" followed by a subject and then the main verb. A corrected version could be: "Who does Leonardo love?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Francesco" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "is". Additionally, "capo" is correctly used as a noun and agrees with the number of the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "weighed" agrees with the singular subject "thirty kilos". Additionally, the verb tense is consistent and the preposition "by" is correctly used to indicate the agent of the action.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "mio nonno" matches with the singular verb form "ha venduto", and the object of the sentence "il suo podere" correctly uses an article before it to indicate that it is specific rather than general.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of the words are used appropriately for their intended meaning. Additionally, there are no obvious morphological or semantic errors present.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because there should be an apostrophe after "Riccardo" to indicate possession, and the word "nel" should be "in". So the corrected form would be: "In qualemobile mise Riccardo's la cassa?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In this case, "lo scoglio" is the subject, and "affiora" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "Andrea" as singular subject matches with the third person present tense of the verb "si comporta".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "sottrae" does not agree with its subject "Leonardo". In English, this would be similar to saying "Leonardo subtracts the pen", which is also grammatically incorrect. A correct form could be "Leonardo tiene la pluma" or "Leonardo takes away the pen."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "legges," which is in third person singular form. The preposition "a" indicates that the location where Alessandro reads is "letto." Therefore, this sentence can be translated to "Alessandro reads a book in bed."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming a simple sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and a predicate ("beve il the in una tazzina di porcellana"). All words are used correctly in their respective forms according to morphological conventions.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the word order is incorrect and there is no question word to make it into an interrogative sentence. In this case, "Where" should be added at the beginning of the sentence, followed by the subject ("Andrea") and then the auxiliary verb ("has"). So, the corrected form would be: "Where has Andrea taken a cigarette?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for simple sentences in English. "Tommaso" is the subject, and "estrasse" is the verb that agrees with the singular third person. Additionally, the preposition "nel" introduces the location where the action takes place, which is common usage when describing an event like this one.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires an object for the verb "mange". In this case, since "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "mangia" means "eats", there should be an object after "il riso". It could be something like "Riccardo ci mangia il riso sul tavolo." to indicate that he is eating the rice on the table.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires "s" at the end of the verb "vi supporta" to agree with the plural subject "Tommaso". Additionally, the article before "lastra" should be "la", singular and feminine, instead of "la", plural and masculine.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics. "Edoardo" is the subject, "prese" is the verb that agrees with the singular third-person subject and refers to a past action, and "il libro di storia" is the direct object. There are no spelling or word order errors, so this sentence can be considered acceptable for communication purposes.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. The subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "takes," as both are singular. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "dalla sala della biblioteca" correctly modifies the noun "libro."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "mette," and the objects "le casse" and "il ripiano del montacarichi" are correctly declined. Additionally, the preposition "sul" is appropriately used to indicate that the crates are being placed on top of the platform of the lift.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "you" requires a verb to agree with it in present simple tense, but there is no verb before the name "Francesco". A correct version could be "Where are the photos of Francesco?" or "Where have you put Francesco's photos?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "toglie", and the action described by the verb is clear. Additionally, we understand that "the money" is what Tommaso is removing from the drawer.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La" is the definite article in Italian and it agrees with the feminine gender of "chiave." "Chiave" means key, so the sentence translates to "The key is in the hole," which makes sense because there needs to be something that fits into the lock for it to open.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" agrees with the verb "has planted," and there are no obvious morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in English. "Francesco" is the subject and "ha lanciato" is the verb that agrees with the third person singular subject. The prepositional phrases "dal balcone" and "al giardino" describe where the action took place. Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any ambiguity or errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the preposition "al" should be replaced with the article "ai" before the word "garage". In this case, we need to use the masculine plural form of the definite article ("gli") along with the proposition "a", resulting in "ai." Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Dal giardino Leonardo ha piantato fiori ai garages." However, if there is only one garage, then it remains "al," but since "Leonardo" implies that the subject is male and singular, an agreement error occurs between the subject and the destination location.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the verb "carica" and follows Italian agreement rules for number and person. Additionally, the object of the sentence, "le casse," also agrees with the verb in number. Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper morphological and syntactical structure.

Additionally, there is an adverbial prepositional phrase "in the dungeons of the fortress," providing more information about where Gabriel was imprisoned.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Francesco" matches with the verb "chiuse", and the object of the sentence "Giulia" follows correctly after the verb. Additionally, "nella stanza" functions as an adverbial phrase indicating where the action took place.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "dette," and the object of the preposition "alla" ("al diffusione") correctly matches its corresponding noun "libro." Additionally, the article "il" before "diffusione" indicates that it refers to a specific instance or type of distribution rather than being generic.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" matches with the verb "caricò" in number and tense agreement. Also, the action described by the verb is correctly performed on an appropriate direct object "il camion".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax, and semantics. "Questo" is a singular masculine demonstrative determiner that agrees with its noun "latte." "Deterge" is a third-person present tense verb that means to clean or purify. The preposition "dal" introduces the prepositional phrase "dal volto," which modifies the direct object "le impurità." Overall, this sentence conveys a clear meaning about how milk can be used as a facial cleanser.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "stippò", and the object of the preposition "with" has a plural form that matches the plural noun "vestiti".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "stanno" agrees with the compound subject "La fotografia di Giulia e quella di Lorenzo," which is grammatically plural and requires a third-person plural verb form. Additionally, the preposition "attaccate" correctly indicates that the photographs are physically connected to each other.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the pronoun "la" should be replaced with "le" to agree with its plural antecedent "Paola and the window." A correct version of this sentence would be: "Riccardo allontanò Paola e le finestre l'una dall'altra."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Francesco" matches with the verb "avvolge" and the object "la statua" correctly follows the action of wrapping described by the verb. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in una tela di lino" describes how the statue is being wrapped. All these elements are syntactically and semantically appropriate, making the sentence grammatically acceptable.

Additionally, the indirect object "Sofia" has the correct form for feminine gender and singular number, which matches the meaning of accompanying one person to the movies.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" and "Paola" are both singular nouns that can be the subject of a sentence. In this case, they are the subjects of the verb "accompanied". Additionally, the past tense form "accompanied" agrees with the number and person of its subject. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because books typically do belong in or on a closet/wardrobe but they are not stored "in" an armadio which refers to a piece of furniture used as a cabinet in Italian. If the intended meaning was that the books were located inside some other type of storage container within the closet then additional words would be needed for clarity.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "attraversò", and the definite article "il" correctly precedes the adjective "meno" which modifies the noun "parte". Additionally, the preposition "del" introduces the possessive phrase that modifies "fiume."

0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "beve" does not agree with its subject "il vino." In English, it would be as if we said "The wine drinks Alexander," which is clearly incorrect since only animate beings can drink. Therefore, the grammatically correct form should use a passive construction like "Il vino viene bevuto da Alessandro" or change the subject to an animat one, for example: "Alessandro beve il vino".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for simple sentences with multiple subjects and verbs in English. Both "Francesco" and "Maria" are singular nouns, so we use "ha" and "è", respectively. Additionally, each verb corresponds to its appropriate subject ("Francesco" - "ha"; "Maria" - "è").

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and has a clear meaning. "Sofia" is the subject, and she is doing the action of loving someone or something referred to as "lo".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because arthritis cannot paralyze bones. Arthritis refers to inflammation and stiffness of the joints, not bones. Therefore, it is semantically incorrect to say that arthritis has paralyzed bones.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the indirect object "lo" should be placed after the verb it refers to ("mangiare"). A correct version of this sentence would be "Maria vuole mangiarlo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" matches with the verb "ammira" and agrees in number (singular). Also, the object of the sentence "Alice" correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and "la" refers to someone or something that Riccardo admires, which could be a specific person or thing mentioned earlier in conversation.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject and he has the goal of reaching for the presidency which is expressed by the verb "mira".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "sul" is a preposition that means "on," and it agrees with its noun "letto."

Therefore, this sentence can be translated as "It is immediately that Edward wants coffee."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "È" requires a singular verb form, but "al successo" is a plural noun phrase. Additionally, there seems to be some confusion with word order and preposition usage. A possible correction could be: "Tommaso tiene alla riuscita."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" matches with the singular verb form "mira". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "at the presidency" correctly functions as the goal or aim of the action expressed by the verb "mira."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "adora". Additionally, the object of the sentence "the cinema" is also grammatically correct and clear to understand.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "il cinema" and the verb that agrees with it is "adora". The phrase "che Francesco adora" functions as an adjective clause modifying "cinema", describing which specific cinema Francesco loves.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error. "È" is used correctly as a third person singular form of the verb "to be", agreeing with the subject "il cinema".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the given sentence.

It would be more appropriate to say something like "Alessandro le adora perché hanno gambe lunghe (Alessandro loves them because they have long legs)".

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense. "Riccardo" as both the subject and object of the sentence agrees with the verb "promises," which is in third person singular form.

0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because an octopus cannot be eaten by a person; it is the other way around.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming possessive nouns and using them to indicate possession or ownership. In this case, "Paola's" is used as an adjectival phrase to describe which house Alessandro admires.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because of its implausible meaning. Absorbing another person physically is nonsensical and cannot occur accidentally or intentionally.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the form of the verb should be "distributes" to agree with the singular subject "Lorenzo". Therefore, it should be "Lorenzo distributes bricks." instead of "Lorenzo distribuisce mattone".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "dipinga" and the adjective "bello" correctly describes the action of painting or what is being painted by Riccardo.

1	Correct	The sentence "Fa neve" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian syntax for weather expressions, which don't require an explicit subject. In this case, "fa" serves as the third-person singular verb form of "fare", meaning "to make or to do". Since we are referring to the snow making its own action by falling from the sky, using "fa" without a specified subject makes perfect sense and doesn't violate any syntactic rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. "Dormicchiare" is a reflexive verb that agrees with its subject "Alessandro," which is singular and masculine. Additionally, the preposition "nell'" takes the locative form of the article "l'", agreeing in gender and number with its object "inazione".

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the path" matches with the verb "arrives," and there are no other errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the subject "La Maggioranza" is plural and requires a verb conjugated to agree with it in number. In this case, "patteggia," which means "pleads guilty" or "bargains", should be replaced by its plural form "patteggiano".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there should be "with" after "fights" to connect the prepositional phrase "on this point." A possible correction would be: "Emma fights on this point with him/her/them."

0	History	The sentence is grammatically correct but the statement itself is not accurate. Japan did invade and occupy Manchuria for several years, but it was not officially a colony of Japan. Therefore, saying "colonized" might be misleading or incorrect depending on historical context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here "Leonardo" is the subject and "had amassed packages" is the verb phrase. There are no errors in morphology, syntax or semantics that I can detect.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the past participle "amassed" requires an auxiliary verb such as "had." In this case, it should be "Leonardo had amassed against the wall," making it grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense verb "had amassed" agrees with the subject "Lorenzo", and the direct object "packets" correctly follows the transitive verb "amassed".

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "coagulates" agrees with its subject "this medicine," and the meaning of the sentence is clear. There are no apparent morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors.

Additionally, the object of the sentence, "il pollo al limone," is correctly gendered to match the gender of the noun "pollo".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the verb "partoriscono" does not match the subject "le donne". In English, it would be like saying "The women give birth to children." instead of "Women give birth to babies." This type of error occurs when there is an incorrect association between words that have different number features, such as singular and plural.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" matches with the verb "converts," and the object "the sugar" correctly follows the verb. Also, there are no semantic errors such as logical inconsistencies or incorrect word choices. Therefore, this sentence can be considered completely accurate without any mistakes in morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the government" matches with its verb "converts," and the objects "opponents" and "criminals" are clearly defined. Additionally, there is no apparent morphological or semantic errors that would make this sentence incorrect.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the direct object pronoun "ne" does not agree with its antecedent "Francesco". In this case, "lo" should be used instead of "ne" to agree in gender and number with "Francesco". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Alice lo travestì da donna."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the verb "liberò", which is conjugated correctly to agree with the third person singular masculine subject. Additionally, the direct object pronoun "ne" refers back to the previously mentioned noun phrase "il cane". Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the subject "lo Stato" (the State) is singular and agrees with the third person singular form of the verb, but instead it uses the third person plural form ("accorda"). It should be "Lo Stato accorda *troppa* **fa** fiducia all'amministrazione pubblica." or better yet, for improved style, "Lo Stato concede troppa fiducia all'amministrazione pubblica.", where "concede" is used as an alternative to "accorda".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" matches with the verb form "attribuì", and all the elements of the sentence are well-structured and appropriate for its meaning. In addition, there is no punctuation or word choice error that can alter the intended message.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In this case, "Leonardo" is the subject, "addebitava" is the verb, and "il suo insucesso alla decisione del padre di andare in Francia" is the object. All parts of speech are used correctly, and there is no semantic inconsistency or ambiguity.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not morphologically correct because the verb "abbandona" does not agree with its subject "Francesco". In English, this would be like saying "Francisco **abandons** his wife on road." instead of "Francisco **abandon** his wife on road.", where "*abandons*" agrees with the singular subject "Francisco", but sounds incorrect to native speakers as we typically use the plural form when talking about abandoning someone. Similarly here, one should say "Francesco **abbandonano** sua moglie..." since it means more than one person or thing is leaving something behind; otherwise, it should be "...sua moglie *è stato lasciato* sulla strada..." if only one entity left her there.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I ladri" agrees with the verb "rubano", and the objects "le auto" and "ai legittimi proprietari" are correctly placed within the sentence. Additionally, the article "le" before "auto" also agrees with its plural form. Overall, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics. "Maria" is the subject, "spalmò" is the verb in past tense that agrees with the singular subject, and "il pane" and "con il coltello" are objects of the verb.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "mise" does not match the subject "Riccardo." In English, we would say "Riccardo put the hat on the table," which demonstrates that the object should be "the table" and the action is "put," so in this case, it should be "mise la table" or better yet, since names are already masculine or feminine in French, "Riccardo posa la table."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors. "Aviazione" agrees with the past tense verb "bombardò", and "nemica" describes what kind of aviation it was. The direct object "napalm" is the substance that was dropped from the airplanes onto the target, which is "the city".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it implies an unusual or impossible action. "Imbevere" means to soak something with a liquid until it is saturated, but bread absorbs the liquid and doesn't remain wet on the surface like wine would leave when used as intended for dipping or soaking. A more appropriate phrase could be "Andrea intinge il pane nel vino."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "red satin" agrees with the verb "covered" in number and tense, and the object "pillows" also agrees with the verb in number. Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no obvious semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" matches with the verb "dissemine", and the object of the preposition "nei" is "sui suoi racconti". Additionally, the adjective "divertenti" agrees with its noun "aneddoti." All words are used appropriately for their parts of speech, and there is no missing or extra information.
0	Morphology	The verb "disseminate" is incorrectly conjugated; the correct form for third-person plural subjects like "tourists" is "disseminate," not "disseminato." Additionally, "of cartacces" should be "of cartaccies" to agree with the plural subject and verb.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the object of "nutrí" should be a noun instead of an infinitive phrase ("of being...", which functions as a subject complement). It would be more appropriate to say "Gabriele nutrí al suo figlio con l'idea di essere..." or something similar that conveys the intended meaning while using grammatically correct structures.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "liberò" and the object of the preposition "dalle" also agrees with it. Additionally, there are no apparent errors in word choice or arrangement that would make the sentence unacceptable in standard English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" is singular and agrees with the verb "scarica". Also, "Giulia" is the direct object of the sentence, which is correctly linked to the verb using "dalle". There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is the subject and "ne ottiene la libertà" is the predicate. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English Subject-Verb-Object word order and all of its elements agree with each other morphologically and syntactically.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "fares" is incorrectly used. It should be "makes" or "creates". Additionally, there needs to be an article before "lead", so it would be "the lead". So a possible correction could be: "The alchemist makes gold from lead."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. "Riccardo" as the subject agrees with the verb "spostò", which is in past tense form to match the time frame of the action described by the verb. Additionally, the prepositional phrases provide clear spatial information regarding the movement of the object ("il cappello") from one location ("l'armadio") to another ("al tavolo").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" has an agreement with the verb "pone", and the object "il libro" correctly uses the definite article before a singular noun. Additionally, the preposition "sulla" agrees with its feminine gender object "la scrivania".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object with proper tense agreement between the subject and verb. Here, "Alessandro" is the subject, "prese" is the past tense of the verb "take," and "il cappotto dall'armadio" is the object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "spedì" in number and tense, and the object "la ricevuta" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "all'ufficio delle imposte" provides more information about where the letter was sent. Overall, this sentence has proper morphological agreement between words as well as appropriate syntactic structure.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it has a clear subject ("Paola"), verb ("pushed") and object ("le gambe di Francesco"). It also uses the right preposition "towards" to indicate direction.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Foresteria" is a singular noun that means guesthouse in English. "Ospitare" is the verb which takes the third person singular form with an "-s". "Gli" is a plural direct object pronoun referring to "gli intervenuti", meaning attendees or participants in this context. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and uses proper verb forms for each subject. Here, "Il dottore" is the subject that performs an action on "le tonsille di Gabriele", which is the object of this sentence. Additionally, "spennella" agrees with its singular subject "il dottore." Therefore, there are no errors regarding morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" matches with the verb "archiviò", and there are no errors in morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. "Gomiti" agrees with the verb "poggiano" and the prepositional phrase "sul davanzale" correctly follows the verb indicating where the action of "poggiano" takes place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the verb "affoga," and both are singular; moreover, the object of the sentence "i dispiaceri" agrees with the preposition "nel." All words have their appropriate form, morphologically speaking, so there aren't any errors in this category either. Additionally, semantically, it makes sense as an idiomatic expression for coping with negative emotions or disappointments by indulging in wine.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "a good captain" agrees with the verb "attracts," and both are singular; also, there are no obvious morphological or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb-object structure and uses proper prepositions to indicate location. Here, "Andrea" is the subject who performed an action of moving something, which is indicated by the verb "spostò". He moved "il bicchiere", which is the object here. Also, we can see that he changed its place from "the table" to "the shelf", hence using two different prepositions "dal" and "sul".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "pompava", and the meaning of the sentence is clear. Additionally, there are no obvious errors in morphology or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all of the words are used appropriately. The subjects "Alessandro" and "Leonardo" agree with the verb "negoziate," which is the third person plural form of the verb "negotiate." Additionally, the object "la libertà di Maria" correctly uses an article to introduce the noun phrase followed by a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun phrase. Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper morphological agreement between subjects and verbs as well as appropriate use of syntax to construct a complex sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error related to morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" matches with the verb "ricava", and the object of the sentence "danaro" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, the preposition "dalle" agrees with its object "sue applicazioni". Overall, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" and the verb "allontana" agree in number and tense, and the object of the preposition "dalla" also agrees with its verb in number.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "Leonardo" is the subject and it is followed by the verb "conta", which means "counts". The indirect object of the sentence is "su Francesco". This construction is used to indicate that one person relies on another for something. So, the entire sentence can be translated as "Leonardo counts on Francesco."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules and the meaning of the sentence can be understood without any ambiguity or confusion. The subject "Sofia" has a verb that agrees with its number ("confuses"), and there are no morphological errors such as misspelled words or incorrect use of tense. Additionally, the semantics of the sentence make sense since it expresses a clear relationship between the concepts of pleasure and being courted by someone.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso fondeva l'argento con l'oro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian morphology and syntax. Here, "Tommaso" is the subject performing the action described by the verb "fondeva", which agrees with its singular masculine form. Additionally, both "l'argento" and "l'oro" are correctly declined as direct objects using the definite article "l'" to indicate that they refer to specific quantities of silver and gold respectively. Therefore, there are no errors or issues with this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "substitutes," and the object of the sentence "the cathode ray tube" is clear and specific. Additionally, the preposition "with" correctly introduces the tool being used by the subject. Overall, the syntax, morphology, and semantics are all consistent with standard English usage rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "le sostituisce" and the object of the preposition "il tubo catodico" correctly follows the verb phrase "sostituisce". Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "alternates" agrees with its subject "Tommaso," and the structure of the sentence indicates that Tommaso is performing an action on two objects, which are Beatrice and Paola. This type of construction where the indirect object comes before the direct object without any preposition is common in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence "L'amore lega" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. "L'amore" means love and "lega" means binds or connects. Therefore, this sentence translates to English as "Love binds."
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele dorme" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb ("dorme") agrees with its singular subject ("Gabriele").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "desires", and the object "un libro" follows standard rules for word order and agreement in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject and takes the verb "desires." "Il fatto che tu venga" is a noun clause acting as the direct object of the sentence. It has its own subject ("tu") and predicate ("venga"). This structure is acceptable in English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" has an agreeing verb "tiene", and the dependent clause "that they promote him" is correctly constructed with the subjunctive form of the verb "promote".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of an independent clause "Maria has made the statement" and a dependent relative clause "that Francis is handsome." Both clauses are correctly constructed and connected with a conjunction "that". There are no morphological or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "bada", and there are no apparent errors in morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "approves", and the object of the sentence "Maria" correctly follows the infinitive phrase "to part". Additionally, the word "that" is appropriately used to introduce the embedded clause.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "dubits" requires a complementizer such as "that" or a wh-word to introduce the embedded question. Also, the verb form "parta" does not agree with the subject "Alice." A corrected version could be: "Emma doubts that Alice will leave."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "viaggi" does not agree with its subject "Che." In English this would be similar to saying "That travels annoys Tommaso," which is also incorrect. A corrected version could be "The fact that Lorenzo is traveling bothers Tommaso" or simply rephrasing it as "Lorenzo's travel annoys Tommaso".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks the necessary verb to connect "Riccardo" and "the idea." A correct version could be "Riccardo approves the idea."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Edoardo" is the subject and the verb that agrees with it is "approva". The phrase "il fatto che Maria canti" is a subordinate clause acting as the direct object of the main clause. It contains the relative pronoun "che", which refers to the fact being approved by Edoardo, and the verb "canti" that agrees with its singular feminine subject "Maria".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks an auxiliary verb to form the question correctly. It should be "Do you want Sophia to come?" instead of "Tu desire Sofia venire."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the preposition "al" should be "alla" since "fumo" is masculine singular and "Riccardo" is male. So the phrase should be "Riccardo va alla fumeria." as "fumo" means smoking or tobacco shop in Italian. If it was meant to say that Riccardo goes to smoke, then it would still need "alla" but also an article before "fumo", so it could be "Riccardo va a fare una sigaretta" which translates to "Riccardo goes for a cigarette".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for expressing desire or longing using the verb "to crave." In this case, "Alice" is the subject who has the desire to return somewhere, as indicated by the gerund form of the verb "tornare," which functions as an infinitive phrase acting as the direct object of the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because "to" should be used instead of "a" after the verb "encourage". The correct form would be: "Andrea encourages Maria to get married."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the structure and word choice follow English syntax rules. "That" could be added at the beginning of the sentence for clarity but it would still be grammatically correct without it.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for expressing an action and its subject. "Andare" which means "to go" in English is a verb that describes the action being taken by the subject of the sentence, "Sofia". Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the subject "La colpisce" requires a singular verb, but "rida" is plural. A grammatically correct version could be "Le colpisce che Riccardo ride."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("BeatricE"), verb ("IS"), and complement ("svestitA"). Additionally, "be" is used appropriately as a linking verb to connect the subject with its description.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it contains two instances of the same subject ("Leonardo") and an incorrect use of the verb "allegra". A more appropriate formulation could be "Leonardo entertains everyone because Maria is laughing."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la tristezza e la noia" agrees with the verb "deprimono", both being plural. Additionally, word order and agreement between adjective and noun are also respected.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Mi" refers to the indirect object and agrees with the verb "acquieta". The subject of the sentence is the noun phrase "che Giulia parli in questo modo", which is singular and agrees with the verb "acquieta".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the presence of Alice alone has a calming effect on me. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "talking to the dancers" agrees with the verb "is", and it conveys a clear meaning that conversing with dancers is enjoyable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" matches with the singular verb form "come." Additionally, the preposition "by" correctly introduces the phrase "the fact that Eduardo speaks of poetry," which functions as the object of the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "di vedere" does not agree with the subject of the sentence "la vista dei marziani." A proper Italian sentence should use "vedere" as the verb and put it after "Paola," like this: "Vide i marziani accadere a Paola."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the phrase "having won the lottery" does not make sense as it is written. It should be rephrased to indicate that winning the lottery had an effect on their expression or appearance. For example, "Winning the lottery made her eyes sparkle."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is no auxiliary verb ("has" or "have") to indicate the past perfect tense. It should be "Di **had** won at the lottery, it was shining in her gaze." instead of "Di **won** at the lottery, it was shining in her gaze."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "We have to flee" instead of "Si tratta che dobbiamo fuggire". In the original sentence, the subject pronoun "si" does not match with the verb "dobbiamo", which requires a first-person plural form such as "we". Additionally, "tratta" is incorrectly used and should be replaced by "have".
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "flee" should be in its third person singular form, which is "flees", to agree with the subject "it".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word usage. "Emma" is singular and the verb form "è" agrees with it. Additionally, "denota" is used correctly to indicate that something implies or suggests a particular meaning.
0	Morphology	The verb "condanno" is incorrect because the correct form to use with third person singular subjects like "Io" is "converte al congiuntivo passato", which would be "condannai". Therefore, the sentence should read "Condemn I the fact that Herod killed the children." However, this form of the verb does not exist in English and thus cannot be translated directly. A possible way to translate it could be "I condemn the fact that Herod had the children killed.", where "had" is used as an auxiliary verb in the past tense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" and the verb "adora" agree in number (singular) and the object of the sentence "Andrea" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, there are no obvious morphological or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" matches with the verb form "intends", and the object of the verb is clear ("to marry Alice"). There are no errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the third person singular verb form "avoids". Additionally, there are no other morphological or syntactical errors present in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "si parta" should be "è bello partire". In the original sentence, "si parta" appears to be trying to convey that it is nice for someone to leave, but this construction requires the use of the third person reflexive pronoun "si", which needs to agree with the subject and verb tense. Additionally, an infinitive ("partire") cannot directly follow another verb like "crede". Instead, you need to express the idea using a clause starting with "che" followed by a conjugated verb form, as shown in my corrected version.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for forming complex sentences in English. "Lorenzo" is the subject and "riteneva" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject. "Alice" is the direct object of the first clause and "Paola" is the indirect object of the second clause. Overall, this sentence expresses a belief held by Lorenzo about Alice being identified as someone else (Paola).
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the word "that" is required between "judges" and "Maria". Also, the verb should agree with its subject in number, so it should be "has" instead of "have". So, a possible correction would be: "Beatrice judges that Maria has too many lovers."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "giudica" does not agree with its subject "Sofia". It should be "Sofia lo **giudica** Maria che abbia troppe amanti." instead of "Sofia lo **giudica che** Maria abbia troppe amanti."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for an embedded question structure in English. "Giulia" (subject) correctly agrees with "lo giudica" (verb). Additionally, "che Maria sia bella" is a subordinate clause functioning as the direct object of "giudicare".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "suppose," and the dependent clause "il padre beva troppo" follows proper Italian syntax rules for forming questions.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "think" should be in its third person singular form ("thinks") to agree with the subject "I". A grammatically correct version would be: "I think something of you."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject-verb agreement rule has been violated. In English, when using "I" and another singular noun as subjects of a sentence connected by "and," we should use the plural form of the verb that corresponds to those subjects. Therefore, it should be "Io e te **pensiamo** che lui ami il tartufo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Emma" matches with the verb "ottene", and the object "qualcosa" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, there is an implied preposition "from you" that completes the meaning of the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "to work" requires an object and "at" should be used before a location or goal of the action, but here it seems that "Alice works at chasing Mary", which does not make sense as "chasing" cannot be a place where someone can work. A possible correction could be "Alice works on catching Maria".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and "plaudes" is the verb that agrees with it in number. The phrase "al fact that Tommaso has won" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial complement modifying how or when Riccardo plauded. It contains another clause ("Tommaso has won") where "has won" is also grammatically correct because it describes a past event from the perspective of the present moment.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it requires the verb "aspire" to be followed by a pronoun or noun. In this case, there should be a pronoun such as "she" after "Maria". So the corrected form would be: "Maria si ispira."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "ci si aggrappa" in number and person. Also, the reflexive pronoun "si" correctly refers back to the subject of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola aims to make the future happy" would be an accurate translation of this sentence into English. Here, "aims" is used as a verb indicating that Paola has a purpose or intention towards making the future happy.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Giulia" is singular and the verb "guardava" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the tense of the verb ("past") correctly describes an action that took place in the past.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and the verb "pensa" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires an auxiliary verb "to be" before the past participle "legato". Also, the direct object "la" should come after the past participle. A possible correction would be "Paola accetta di essere legata."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it implies that Alice is smiling at the fact of having cried, which does not make logical sense. It would be more appropriate to say "Alice smiles despite having cried" or "Alice is happy that she cried".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and the verb "nasce" agrees with its singular subject "la condizione." Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated for tense and number.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a subject "We", a verb "decide" and an object "our analysis." The word "this" refers to something previously mentioned or known from context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the dependent verb "dipendere" agrees with its subject "la tosse," and the subordinating conjunction "dal fatto che" introduces a clause that modifies the main clause by providing additional information about the cause of the coughing.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks the verb "is" or "was". A proper way to write this would be "Leonardo clarifies that it isn't his fault to Paola."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there should be "is" instead of "ha" after the conjunction "that". The verb must agree with its subject, and since "Maria" is singular, we need to use a singular form of the verb. So, it should be: "Andrea whistles to Maria that she is hungry."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "Andrea" is the subject and will possibly make an allusion to "Edoardo". The if-part of the conditional sentence is "if he/she/it/they parts", which in this case is "se partirà". This form is used when talking about someone or something that has not yet done what you are asking about. Therefore, it fits perfectly with the meaning of the sentence, making the whole sentence correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules and has a clear subject ("Paola"), verb ("addebits") and object ("il fatto"). Additionally, all of the elements within the sentence agree with each other in terms of tense and number.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and "lo" refers to something previously mentioned that Riccardo adds to his speech. This type of construction is called a "cataphora," where a pronoun comes before its antecedent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and "ce" is an indirect object pronoun referring to a group or person that includes the speaker and possibly others as well. "Lo" refers to something specific previously mentioned. Therefore, "Maria ce lo ha scommesso" means "Maria bet it on us."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject journalists agrees with the verb attack and the object facts agrees with the preposition on. Also, the relative clause politicians are corrupt is correctly constructed as it modifies the noun fact.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola encourages the fact that the boys go to the sea" is a correctly constructed English sentence with no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject of the sentence is "Emma", and she is performing the action of notifying someone, which is indicated by the verb "avvisa". The recipient of this action is "Alessandro", making the sentence complete with proper syntax and meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics. Morphologically, all words are inflected correctly for number and tense. Syntactically, the subject "Gabriele" agrees with its verb "convinces," and the direct object "lo" refers to a masculine singular noun as required by Italian gender agreement. Semantically, the meaning is clear and coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for forming sentences with transitive verbs and their objects. "Riccardo" serves as both the subject of the sentence and the person who is excusing himself from the trip.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the mayor" and the verb "exempts" agree in number, and the prepositional phrase "of the poor" correctly modifies the direct object "who." Additionally, "from paying the bus fare" provides more information about how the exemption works. Overall, this sentence follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and modification.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" agrees with "si" and the subject of the sentence is singular which matches with the third person singular verb form "sia".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires the verb "discute" instead of "discorre". The subject "Alice and Giulia" are both feminine singular, so the conjugated verb must agree with them in number and gender.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects and verbs agree with each other both in number and person, and the ideas expressed are logically connected by "di" which introduces the reason for something.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "continues", and the pronoun "it" correctly refers to something mentioned earlier in the conversation or text.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the pronoun "lo" refers to an indirect object and should be preceded by the preposition "to." A correct version of this sentence could be: "Leonardo delays eating for him." or "Leonardo makes him delay eating."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "osa". Additionally, the infinitive phrase "mangiare" correctly follows the conjugated verb and agrees with its subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb form "è". Additionally, "capace" agrees with the subject and the preposition "di" correctly introduces an infinitive phrase.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the singular verb "ha." Additionally, the intended meaning of the sentence can be understood clearly.
0	Morphology	The verb "suole" is the third person singular form of the Italian verb "suonare", which means "to play an instrument". In this case, it should be used with the subject "Tommaso". However, since "il pasto" ("the meal") follows "suole", it seems that the intention was to use the third person singular form of the verb "mangiare" ("to eat"). Therefore, the correct form for "Tommaso" would be "mangia" instead of "suole".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the verb "deve mangiarlo." The pronoun "lo" refers to something previously mentioned and agrees in gender (masculine) and number (singular) with its antecedent.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it lacks the verb "uses" to complete the subject-verb agreement with "Gabriele". A correct version of this sentence would be: "Gabriele uses it."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "va", and the preposition "in" correctly introduces the location of the action "camera".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "sale," and the preposition "in" correctly introduces the location of the action.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "disparisce" and the singular number is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, the location "da Parigi" indicates where the action of disappearing takes place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the verb "part," and there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors. All elements of the sentence agree with each other in number, tense, person, and so on.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is the subject of the sentence and "sgambetta" is the verb. The directional phrase "verso il ponte" indicates where the action is taking place.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the subject "the crowd" is plural and requires a verb that agrees with it in number. In this case, the verb should be "correre" instead of "corre". A possible correction could be: "La folla lo corrono a salutare."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of the words are used appropriately.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Beatrice" agrees with the verb "assembles," and the object "computer" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, there are no obvious errors in word choice or syntax.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and there are no apparent errors in morphology or syntax. The subject "the film" agrees with the verb "is," which indicates that the film is owned by someone - in this case, Martin Scorsese.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola works" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Paola") and a verb ("works"), and the form of the verb agrees with the singular third-person subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "l'amica" and the verb "angoscia" agree in number and tense. Additionally, the relative clause correctly modifies "l'amica," providing more information about who she is. The prepositional phrase "di Emma" clarifies whose painting it is that the friend is worrying about. Overall, this sentence has no syntactic or semantic errors and follows standard Italian word order rules for sentences with multiple clauses.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "Many of them read the newspaper" instead of "Molte loro leggono il giornale". In English, we use "many of + pronoun" to refer to more than one person or thing. Additionally, the word for "newspaper" in Italian is "giornale", and its singular form must match with the verb conjugated as "leggono" which is also the plural form.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the word "architect" should be in its plural form, which is "architects", to agree with the verb "were".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "mangia" and the object "la pizza" follows standard Italian syntax rules for transitive verbs.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "that architect has designed some museums" instead of "que arquitecto has algunos projetados museus". In this case, the right form of the verb to agree with the third person singular subject "that architect" must be used. Additionally, the Spanish words "algunos", "projetados", and "museus" are incorrectly included in the English phrase.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because there should be a comma after "molte ragazze" to separate the subject from the adverbial phrase of time "l'anno scorso". Also, it would make more sense for the verb "hanno letto" to agree with the plural subject and have an object pronoun before "il giornale." A possible correction could be: "Hanno letto, molte ragazze, il giornale lo scorso anno."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "the shoulders of Richard" and a verb "touch". The word "touching" could also be used instead of "touch", but both are acceptable. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "of Richard" provides more information about the subject. Overall, this sentence describes an action performed by a specific body part on a surface.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "will be touched," and the tense of the verb is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, the preposition "by" correctly introduces the agent performing the action.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "partiate" does not agree with its subject "che tu". It should be "parte" to match its singular subject. Also, there seems to be an extra word "rallegra", which changes the meaning of the sentence and makes it difficult to interpret correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" and the verb "è" agree in number (singular) and the statement is semantically meaningful as well.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Beatrice" and the verb "is" agree in number (singular) and the conjunction "and" correctly connects two noun phrases as subjects of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and the structure follows English syntax rules. The subject of the sentence "Paola" has an action "has put," which is followed by the direct object "the car." Then we have additional information about whose car it was with "that is her brother's." Finally, there is another prepositional phrase "in the garage" that describes where she placed the car.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because there should be "obey" instead of "obeys" since the subject "Tommaso" is singular and does not match with the verb form "obeys". Additionally, the preposition "of" should be used instead of "di" to indicate possession in English.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it contains an incorrect pronoun-antecedent agreement. In this case, "Andrea" cannot be used as both the subject performing the comparison and the object being compared to at the same time. It should instead read something like "Andrea compares himself to Leonardo," or if referring to another person named Andrea, "Andrea compares her to Leonardo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence, "Maria," is singular and matches with the third person present tense verb "fotografa" and its direct object "Paola." Both subjects and objects agree in number and form, making this sentence acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "stato" agrees with the singular masculine subject "Lorenzo", and the adjective "smanioso" also agrees with the gender and number of the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "tua sorella" and a predicate "guarda il gelato". There are no morphological or syntactical errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "tua sorella" agrees with the verb "guarda" in number and person, and there are no obvious morphological, syntactic or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense and agreement.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha tagliato" does not match the subject "Sofia". A more appropriate verb should be used to reflect that only one person, not multiple people, performed the action described by the verb. For example, "Sofia ha tagliato la testa al toro." would be semantically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the boys" agrees with the verb "would cut," and the expression "cut the rope" is semantically appropriate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the correct verb tense and has a clear subject-verb agreement. It also utilizes proper punctuation marks to separate clauses within the sentence. Additionally, all words are used appropriately according to their morphological forms.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the singular verb form "stende", and the object of the sentence "il bucato" correctly follows the verb.

1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ulula" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ulula" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement for past tense verbs with a singular subject. In this case, "Gabriele" is a singular noun and "dormì" is its corresponding past tense form.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Si" is used as a reflexive pronoun and agrees with the singular subject "il cane". The phrase "in un battibaleno" is an idiom that means quickly or suddenly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "Edoardo" matches with the verb "ci ha messo", and the time expression "due ore" correctly describes how long it took to complete the action.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" matches with the verb "has sezioned", and the object of the verb ("the old elm") is correctly placed after the verb. Additionally, the tense of the verb is consistent throughout the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for expressing past events with multiple subjects and a specific date.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all of its elements agree with each other in number and tense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "diventato" agrees with the singular subject "Andrea". Additionally, the adverbial phrase "in gamba", meaning skillful or adept, is an acceptable way to describe someone's abilities and does not affect the grammaticality of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" matches with the singular verb form "ha", and the indirect object "Giulia" follows the preposition "a".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Here, "Sofia" is the subject, "chiede" is the verb, and "tu" is the object. Additionally, the word "che" introduces a subjunctive clause, which is appropriate given the context.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "tu" requires the use of the second person singular form of the verb, which is "vai", instead of the third person singular form "va". Additionally, there seems to be an extra word "dispiace" that does not fit into the structure of this short sentence. A possible correction could be "Tu te ne vai, mi dispiace." or "Che tu te ne vada dispiace a Beatrice.", depending on what was intended by the original sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order for simple sentences in English. "I bambini" are the subjects of the sentence, and "hanno calpestato" is the verb that agrees with them in number.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the verb "erupted" does not make sense with the subject "the children." Eruption is not something that children can do. A more appropriate verb should be used to describe what the children did or experienced.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and tense consistency. "Quell'uomo" is singular, so "ha" agrees with it; "l'unico testimone" is also singular, so "è" agrees with it as well. Additionally, both actions occurred in the past, which is consistent with the use of "fotografato" and "avvenuto".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "That man" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "has." Additionally, the pronoun "he" has been replaced by an appropriate noun phrase, making the sentence clearer and more informative.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "ha carezzato" does not agree with its subject "Andrea". A singular third-person subject requires the use of "has", so the correct form should be "Andrea has caresed Beatrice's face."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il volto di Paola" agrees with the singular verb "è carezzato." Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules and there are no semantic errors that would make the sentence nonsensical or incorrect in meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence and has verb-ed to "ha fratturato," which agrees with the singular subject. Additionally, "il braccio di Maria" correctly shows possession using the preposition "di." Overall, this sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it has an incorrect meaning. Paralyzing someone else's limb is not possible and implies harm or violence which is generally unacceptable unless explicitly stated that the situation is hypothetical or fictional.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper tense agreement between the singular subject "the baby" and the verb "weighed". Additionally, all elements of the sentence are coherent semantically.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "gli operai" (the workers) agrees with the verb "asfaltarono" (they paved). Additionally, the object of the sentence, "la strada" (the road), follows proper agreement rules and clearly defines what was paved by the workers.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" matches with the verb "elencò", which agrees in number and tense. Additionally, the object of the sentence "l'invitato" follows standard Italian word order rules by coming after the verb it relates to.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the conjunction "and" is used to connect two verbs ("has put" and "happened") that have different subjects. It should be rephrased as follows: "Alice has put the clothes in the closet, and then it happened."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Beatrice" matches with the verb "riempie", and the object of the preposition "with" is clear ("frutta").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" is singular and the verb "difende" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the preposition "dai" is correctly used to indicate that Maria is defending Andrea from something or someone else.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "passes" agrees with its singular subject "the book," and the prepositional phrase "from Maria to Maria" correctly uses parallel structure for the two objects of the preposition.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with its verb "dà", and it follows the SVO structure (Subject-Verb-Object) where "un libro" serves as the direct object of the action performed by the subject to another person indicated through the preposition "to".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is the subject and he is delegating someone as his representative, which is expressed by "Gabriele". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" and the verb "delegates" are both singular, and the direct object "Maria" correctly follows the indirect object "sua representante".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires a conjunction such as "and" to connect the two independent clauses "Lorenzo lives in Rome" and "this happens." A corrected version would be: "Lorenzo lives in Rome, and this happens."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in English. "Riccardo" is the subject and "has eaten" is the verb that agrees with the singular third person present tense form. Additionally, "and" connects two independent clauses together appropriately.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" agrees with the verb "fuma", and the object "una bionda" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, there are no apparent semantic errors or morphological issues that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb tense agreement between the subject "Edoardo" and the verb "ha spalmato". Additionally, all words are used appropriately within their context and there are no apparent semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" matches with the verb "ha spalmato", and the object of the verb ("il pane di paté") follows the right structure. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "piovevano" does not agree with its subject "le bombe". In English, we would say that the verb doesn't "agree" with its subject. In this case, the subject "le bombe" is feminine plural and requires a verb form that agrees with it. A correct version of this sentence could be "Le bombe ci piombavano addosso." or "I bombardamenti si abbattevano su di noi.", depending on what you want to express exactly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I matrimoni misti" agrees with the verb "funzionano," both being plural forms. Additionally, there are no apparent errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "my idea" agrees with the verb "equivales", and it follows the required structure to express an opinion or thought using the phrase "the idea that".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Both "idea" and "la" are singular and feminine, so they agree in number and gender. Additionally, the adjective "mia" agrees with its noun "la" in gender and number. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "gira", and the action described by the verb is possible to happen in real life. Also, there are no obvious semantic or morphological errors that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Giulia" agrees with the verb "torna" and all words are used appropriately for the intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" performs an action ("controlla") on the object "Paola". Both the subject and verb agree in number (singular). Additionally, there are no obvious morphological or semantic errors present in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Maria," and she is giving consent for her daughter to go out with a certain boy.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it lacks the verb "watches". In English, we need to have a verb that connects the subject and object of the sentence. A possible correction would be "Alice watches Mary."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the sentence "Paola doubts you." Doubt is a verb that can take a direct object and here it takes the pronoun "you" as its object. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is also correct with the singular third person present tense form of the verb "doubts".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" and the verb "desires" are both singular, and the dependent clause "that you leave" correctly uses subjunctive mood to express desire or request.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means "That Juliet is always traveling pleases Andrea." In English, the subjunctive mood ("that she travel") is used to express hypothetical or uncertain situations; Italian uses the present tense for this purpose as well.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects and verbs agree with each other in number, and the word order follows standard English syntax rules for forming a simple declarative sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the structure of a dependent clause ("Francesco desidera") being followed by an infinitive phrase ("che lui venga"). This type of construction is often used to express desires or requests.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactic or semantic errors present. The subject of the sentence "Leonardo" is doing the action of "annotating", and he is annoting that the president will write his autobiography. Both ideas are logically connected with the conjunction "that".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the subjunctive mood should be used after "invita" since it is a request. Also, there needs to be an infinitive verb form after "che." A possible correction would be: "Alessandro invita Paola a partire."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alice" and the auxiliary verb "has accompanied" agree in number (singular) and tense (past). Additionally, the indirect object "Tommaso" follows the appropriate preposition "al." There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la partenza" agrees with the verb "apporta," both being singular. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "a tutti" correctly describes to whom or what the benefit applies.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for expressing an action performed by one person towards another with respect to something else. In this case, "Alessandro" (the subject) is lamenting about "the dirty sea" (the object of his complaint) to "Paola". All elements are syntactically connected and form a complete thought.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alice" matches with the verb "mette," and the object "Tommaso" correctly follows the verb. Also, there are no missing or extra words that would make it incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" is the subject and "leaves" is the verb. "Leonardo" is the indirect object and "pieni poteri" is the direct object. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the adjective "pianto" should agree with the gender and number of the subject "il piatto", so it must be changed to "piange". In Italian, masculine singular subjects require an -e at the end for present tense verbs ending in -ere or -ire. Therefore, the correct form of the verb "piangere" for this context would be "piange".
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "girare" should be in its third person singular form "gira". In this case, the subject of the sentence ("le scatole") requires that the verb agrees with it in number and gender. Therefore, the correct version would be "Mi gira(no) le scatole."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "si è attaccata" agrees with the singular subject "Alice". Additionally, the preposition "a" and its object "un capello" are correctly used to indicate that Alice attached something to one hair.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "piantato" does not agree with its subject "Maria". A singular third-person feminine subject requires the use of an -a ending on past participles when used with auxiliary verbs like "ha." Therefore, it should be "María lo plantó en la estacada," which means "Maria planted him in the stake."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects "Sofia" and "Riccardo" are both third person singular pronouns, so the verb "parlano" which means "speak" in English agrees with them in number and person. Additionally, the preposition "la" which means "the" in English, followed by "stessa lingua", meaning "same language", correctly indicates that both subjects speak the same language.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "have" should be in its third person singular form "has". The subject of the sentence ("courage") requires a verb conjugated to agree with it in number.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the word "paturnies" does not exist in English language. It seems that you intended to write "anxieties", which would make the sentence grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because there should be an apostrophe after "boxes" to indicate possession. The corrected form would be "Have socks on the boxes'."
0	Morphology	The phrase is not correct because "essere" should be conjugated to match the singular subject "un ventre". A correct form would be "è", so the corrected sentence reads as follows: "Essere in un ventre." However, this still might raise some semantic questions since being inside a cow's womb doesn't make much sense without additional context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in morphology, syntax or semantics. The phrase "This situation has put you in the eye of the storm" means that this particular situation has caused serious problems and difficulties for the person being referred to.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and "spera" is the verb. The subjunctive mood is used correctly to express hope or desire for something that may not happen ("possa partire").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alice" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "is". Additionally, there are no obvious semantic or morphological errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "we" agrees with the verb "are," and the phrase "charged up with supplies" is a colloquial expression that means to have a lot of something, often food or water, especially for a trip or journey.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the girl" agrees with the verb "will eat" and the object "the pizza." Additionally, there are no obvious errors in morphology or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the verb "obbedisce", and both are singular; also, the preposition "to" correctly introduces the indirect object of the sentence, which is "Sofia".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject and "ci va" is the verb phrase. The subject agrees with the verb in number, so there are no morphological or syntactic errors. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear, indicating that there are no semantic issues.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the verb "andrà", both being singular. Also, the sequence of events is clear and makes sense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the verb "va", and the object of the preposition "a" has the article "la" which agrees in gender and number with "Giulia". Additionally, the infinitive phrase "a invitare" correctly follows the preposition "a" to indicate purpose or intent.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is a missing subject and verb agreement issue. It should be "Beatrice runs to the store" or similar phrasing that includes both a clear subject and an appropriate conjugated verb for that subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "the books that Leonardo puts on the shelves now" and a verb "are." All words are used correctly according to their function within the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Edoardo" and a verb "mette" that agrees with the singular subject. The object of the sentence is "i libri," which correctly comes after the verb and before the location "sugli scaffali."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the word order is incorrect. It should be "Sono gli libri quelli che Leonardo mette sugli scaffali ora." In Italian, the verb must agree with the subject in number and gender, so "libri" which is plural masculine requires "sono" as a plural form of "essere". Also, the relative pronoun "quelli" is needed to refer back to "libri", and it agrees in number and gender as well.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "mangia" in number and person, and it follows the standard word order of Italian sentences (Subject-Verb-Object).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a clear subject ("I"), verb ("will"), and object ("this message").
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo and his friends will go to the park" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in English. "Riccardo and his friends" are plural so the verb "will go" agrees with the subject. Additionally, the adverbial phrase "to the park" correctly modifies the verb by telling us where they will be going.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple English sentence with a subject ("Francesco"), verb ("piace") and an object ("Maria"). Additionally, "per" followed by "le sue gambe" provides a proper explanation for why "A Francesco piace Maria."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" and the verb "accarezza" agree in number (singular) and the object "le gambe di Maria" correctly follows the verb with the right preposition "di".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "gradì". The tense and mood are also appropriate for past events, as indicated by the use of the past tense. Additionally, there is no semantic inconsistency or ambiguity that would detract from the overall coherence of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English declarative sentence with subject and predicate. "Francesco" is the subject, while "ricorda qualcosa" is the predicate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense "was" to refer to the conversation that took place between the two boys and then says that Paola criticized that conversation using the past tense "criticized."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence have been used correctly and they express a complete thought that can be understood easily. "Leggeva" which is the past tense of "leggere" agrees with the subject "he", "i" refers to the object being read which are "the names," "of" connects the noun "names" to its genitive form "artists" while "alla" means "to the" indicating where or whom something was directed at.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and uses appropriate tense and agreement between the verb "has" and its singular subject "He".
1	Correct	The sentence "Era felice di ciò" is grammatically correct. Although the subject of the sentence ("era") is singular and in the past tense, it agrees with its complement ("felice"), also singular and past tense. Additionally, the adverbial expression "di ciò" correctly indicates what the subject is happy about. Overall, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "he" agrees with the verb "was." Although there is no explicit subject mentioned in this sentence, we assume that it refers to someone who was happy to play cards.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Alessandro") and a verb ("disgusta"), and an object ("Giulia"). There are no morphological or syntactical errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for forming questions and uses appropriate verb tense agreement between the subject ("you") and auxiliary verb ("do").
1	Correct	The sentence "Ha abboccato all'amo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence where the subject comes before the verb and there are no obvious morphological or syntactical errors present in the sentence. In this case, the subject is implied as understood from context, which is common in Italian language usage.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the past tense of "to laugh" should be used instead of the past participle form. Also, the subject-verb agreement is incorrect; it should be "I have laughed two hours," since "I have" requires a verb in third person singular such as "laughed."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "He" agrees with the verb "has taken." Additionally, the past participle "taken" correctly uses auxiliary verb "has" to form the present perfect tense. The object of the sentence "a crush on Sophia" contains an article "a," noun "crush," preposition "on," and proper noun "Sophia". Overall, this sentence has a clear structure and good syntax.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "is". Additionally, there are no other apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors within the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In this case, "he" serves as the subject, "conserved" acts as the verb, and "the control of the society" functions as the object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "ha venduto," and the object "i suoi vestiti" follows the proper rules for number agreement as well. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "al mercato delle pulci" correctly uses an article to begin it and then includes the noun modified by another adjective.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "ha confrontato," and the object of the preposition "in" is correctly placed after it. Additionally, the definite article "i" preceding "due libri" shows that we are referring to specific books, which makes sense in this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "ha immerso," and the object of the sentence, "il figlio", correctly follows the verb. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "nell'acqua fredda" provides more information about where or how the action took place. Overall, this sentence has a clear structure and meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "leggeva", and the tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, the adverbial phrase "sul divano" provides more context to where Leo was reading.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because the meaning of "the consensus of people" being born from someone's talent is illogical and nonsensical. Consensus refers to agreement or accord among people, it cannot be born like a human being.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "guarda" agrees with it in number and person. The phrase "che tutto proceda per il meglately" is a dependent clause that functions as the direct object of the sentence. It is introduced by the relative pronoun "che", which refers to the idea of something being watched over or monitored by Francesco. Overall, the sentence has a clear meaning and follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Francesco" is the subject of the sentence and it is correctly conjugated in third person singular present tense ("si vergogna"). * "che" introduces a subordinate clause that functions as the direct object of the verb "vergognarsi". * "sia successo" is a past participle phrase used to indicate that something happened in the past. It agrees with the subject in number and gender. * Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Giulia" matches with the verb "deve", and the time expression "domani" correctly appears at the end of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "established" agrees with its subject "Francesco", and the preposition "with" introduces the indirect object "Maria". Also, the phrase "the departure of Tommaso" functions as the direct object of the sentence. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactic or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "has left," and the object "the husband" follows the expected structure of being preceded by an article ("the") and having a possessive pronoun refer to it ("her").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error. "L'affitto di quella casa" is the subject and it means "the rent of that house". "Gli" refers to someone who receives the money, and "rende" means "yields", so the whole phrase can be translated as "The rent of that house yields him 500 euros."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the past tense and uses subject-auxiliary inversion to form a question. The verb "have" agrees with the plural subject "they".
0	Morphology	The verb "monta" should be "monta" to agree with the singular subject "il." Therefore, the grammatically correct form of this sentence is "Gli monta il sangue alla testa molto facilmente."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "Ha" agrees with its subject in number and person, and the verb tense ("ha costruito") correctly indicates that the action was completed in the past relative to some point in time but not necessarily in the distant past.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because the noun "terreno" ("land") cannot fruit money. Fruiting is an action associated with plants and living organisms that produce fruits or vegetables, not something that land does to earn money. A more appropriate way to express this idea might be: "That land generates significant income."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and has no semantic errors. The action "ha fatto scrivere" is performed by the subject "Gabriele", who instructed "Riccardo" to write a letter for "Lorenzo".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject ("Il vento"). In Italian, when using the passato remoto tense of a transitive verb like "fare", the auxiliary verb used should be "avere". However, the agreement between the past participle and the subject must also be checked. In this case, since the past participle "fatto" ends in "-o", it agrees only with masculine singular subjects. To make the past participle agree with feminine or plural subjects such as "il vento", we need to add endings: -a for feminine singular and -i for plural. Therefore, the corrected form would be "Il vento l'ha fatta rompere dal vetro da Andrea."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "made" does not agree with its subject "the colonel." A singular third-person subject requires a helping verb before the past tense of the main verb, so it should be "The colonel had made the ship" or "The colonel made the ship," depending on context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the rock" matches with the verb "has broken", and both are singular; also, the object of the sentence "the glass" correctly follows the action expressed by the verb.

0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because birds typically do not feed from their mother. It is semantically incorrect as it suggests an impossible or unlikely scenario. Birds usually leave the nest and become independent shortly after hatching; they do not continue to feed from their mothers.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" takes the third person singular verb form "took," and the direct object of the sentence is "a crush."

1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo ha preso fischi per fiaschi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian morphology, syntax and semantics. In this sentence, "ha preso" is the third person singular form of the verb "prendere," which agrees with the subject "Lorenzo." Additionally, the phrase "fischi per fiaschi" is an idiomatic expression that means to make mistakes or fail completely, making the sentence meaningful and coherent.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "Lorenzo" is the subject and it is in singular form. - "ne" is a pronoun that refers to something mentioned before and here it refers to two things. - "disse" is the past tense of "dire", which means "to say". It agrees with the singular subject "Lorenzo." - "due" is an adjective that modifies "things," referring to what was mentioned before. - "a" is a preposition indicating movement or direction towards someone or something. - "Maria" is the indirect object of the sentence. So, overall, this sentence has a clear meaning, good word order, and proper use of verb forms, making it grammatically correct.

The direct object of this sentence is "le traduzioni", and it indicates what Riccardo does to them. Finally, we have additional information about the type of translations - "dei bollettini di guerra." This phrase provides context for the reader and makes it clear that these are not just any translations but those related to war reports.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "tu" requires the verb to be in second person singular form ("ridi"), but instead the third person singular form ("ride") was used. Additionally, there should be no comma before the conjunction "in". A correct version of this sentence would be: "Di te ridi in maniera beffarda."
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso legge." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple Italian sentence with a subject ("Tommaso") and a verb ("legge"). In this case, "legge" means "reads", so the entire sentence translates to "Tommaso reads".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for expressing an action performed by a subject on an object (Gabriele is the subject and Maria is the object of the action "call"). The verb "does" is implied but not necessary to include due to the use of the present tense.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the pronoun "lo" refers to an object that has been mentioned before and it agrees with its antecedent in gender and number. In this case, "lo" refers to "lei", which was previously mentioned. Also, the use of gerund ("girando") after the preposition "con" is appropriate in Italian.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il cedro" agrees with its verb "ama," and the object "la libertà" correctly follows the preposition "a." Additionally, each word has been used appropriately within the context of the sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because gardeners cannot prune dogs. Pruning or cutting back overgrown plants is not something that can be done to dogs. Therefore, the action described in this sentence does not make sense when considering the meaning of "potato".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the indirect object "Alessandro" should come before the direct object "una ricca eredità". In English this would be similar to saying "John gave the book him" instead of "John gave him the book." Therefore, the corrected sentence should be "A Lorenzo, Alessandro le ha lasciato una ricca eredità."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" matches with the verb "beve", and the article "il" correctly precedes the noun "caffè".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology.

Additionally, the verb "practices" agrees with its singular subject, making the sentence semantically appropriate as well.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the word "cotta" does not make sense in this context when referring to a refrigerator having romantic feelings towards someone named Francesco. A more appropriate word choice would be needed for clarity and coherence of meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb tense agreement. "Tommaso" is the subject of the sentence, "dette" is the past tense third person singular form of the verb "to give," which agrees with the subject "Tommaso." "Gli schiaffi" are the direct object of the sentence that receives the action from the verb "dette". Overall, this sentence has no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" performs an action denoted by the verb "allungò" on the object "Giulia". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make this sentence incorrect.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "procede", and the object of the preposition "of" has a clear referent ("casse"). Additionally, the word order follows standard English rules for declarative sentences.

0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "gives" does not match with its subject "Riccardo". It should be either "Riccardo gives many blows to the dog." or "Riccardo is giving many blows to the dog.", as the singular third-person present form of the verb must agree with its singular subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Lorenzo", and the verb that agrees with this singular subject is "sale".

0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "corre" does not agree with its subject "Alessandro". In English, this would be as if we said "Alessandro runs-s", instead of "Alessandro runs". Therefore, the correct form should be "Alessandro corri l'asina."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics. Morphologically, each word is correctly inflected or derived. Syntactically, the words are arranged into a structure that conveys meaning appropriately. Semantically, the words have meanings appropriate to their syntactic roles and convey a coherent message about someone named "Francesco" capturing an animal identified as a "cervo".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because refrigerators cannot entice or persuade cats. This type of action is typically associated with animate beings that have the ability to make decisions based on incentives offered by others. A more appropriate sentence might be "The fridge attracted a cat" if there was some feature of the refrigerator that drew the cat towards it.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it contains an incongruous combination of words; refrigerators cannot entice tables as these actions and objects are not compatible semantically.

Additionally, the object of the sentence "la testa" follows the rules for agreement and word order. Overall, this sentence does not contain any morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "piantato" does not agree with its subject "Beatrice". A singular third-person feminine subject requires an -a ending on the past participle of a transitive verb when used without auxiliary verbs like "avere" or "essere", so it should be "piantata" instead of "piantato".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically incorrect, but the phrase "understand the secret intentions of a person" is semantically problematic because it implies mind-reading or assuming something without concrete evidence, which can be misleading and disrespectful to others. It would be better to say "try to infer their motivations based on observable behavior."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "cambia", and the object of the sentence "le carte" follows the appropriate rules for Italian syntax. Additionally, there are no apparent semantic errors that would make this sentence unacceptable in context.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the adjective "cattivo" agrees with the noun "gioco", but it should agree with the subject "Riccardo". A correct version of this sentence would be "Riccardo fa un brutto gioco."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and uses appropriate tense for the action performed by the subject on the object. Here, "Andrea" acts as the subject, "has broken" is the verb used in present perfect tense to describe the completed action, and "the neck" is the object that receives the action from the subject. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically incorrect but may have issues with semantic meaning. "La musica rock" is singular while "rompe le orecchie" implies that multiple things are breaking ears which doesn't make logical sense. It could be rephrased as "Certain types of rock music can damage hearing."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax or semantics. The subject of the sentence is "Riccardo" and he is doing the action of giving something that belongs to Tommaso to him.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It may seem unusual for a fly to jump on someone's nose, but the sentence structure and word choice are appropriate.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "go" should be in the imperative form "go" instead of the base form "goes". Additionally, there should be an article before "mountain", so it should say "to the mountain."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "She" refers to one female person and the verb "was" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the past tense of the verb is appropriate for expressing an action completed in the past.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Indexing" is the gerund form of the verb "to index", which can function as an adjective or a noun. In this case, it functions as a noun and serves as the direct object of the sentence, referring to the action of putting something at the beginning of a list or series.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "alza" should agree with its subject "il gomito," which is masculine singular. However, "alzare" is the incorrect form for this agreement; it should be "alza." Therefore, the corrected sentence would read "Alza il gomito."
0	Lexicon-Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because "perdere" requires a direct object to complete its meaning and the correct phrase should be "perdere la ragione".
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb should be "to pull" instead of "to cavare". In English, there is no such verb as "cavare", and it seems like an incorrect attempt to use the Italian verb with an English sentence structure.
0	Morphology	The phrase is not correct because the past participle "being" should be used instead of the adjective "poor." Additionally, there is a missing subject and verb for this sentence to be complete.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "l'angelo custode" agrees with the verb "accompagna", and the object of the preposition "di" has an appropriate singular form that matches the singular noun "bambino".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a simple subject "ogni bambino" and a compound verb phrase "ha un angelo custode che lo protegge". Each child possesses an individual guardian angel that protects him or her.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "lo smoking" agrees with the singular verb "è". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "a quella feste" correctly describes where it is required to wear formal attire. Therefore, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics.
0	Morphology	The word "nuota" is the Italian verb for "swims", but it should be "new" to describe something as being like new or in good condition. Also, instead of "di zecca," which means "of tick," I believe you are looking for "like new." Therefore, the correct form would be "La moto di Leonardo è come nuova."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" agrees with the verb "have," and the tense of the verb is consistent within the sentence. Additionally, the object "an unit" follows standard English rules for article usage before a singular noun.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper verb tense to indicate that "Leonardo" is the subject of the sentence and that he will return ("ritorni" should be changed either to "ritorna" or "ritornerà"). Also, there needs to be an auxiliary verb such as "does" before "piace" for third person singular subjects. A possible correction could be: "Che Leonardo ritorni PIACE a Maria." However, this would imply that Maria likes the idea of Leonardo returning, rather than expressing pleasure at his actual arrival. If you want to convey that Leonardo has arrived and Maria is pleased about it, consider using the following structure: "Leonardo è tornato e Maria ne è felice".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" agrees with the verb "corre", and the action described by the verb is clearly expressed. Additionally, there are no obvious semantic errors or morphological issues that would make this sentence incorrect.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the verb form "abita", and the prepositional phrase "in una casa piccola" provides additional information about where Riccardo lives.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it contradicts the commonly known fact that Maria is an Italian singer and therefore she should be in Italy if she is currently staying somewhere. A grammatically correct version of this sentence could be "Maria isn't in Rome right now." assuming there is no requirement for her to stay in Rome specifically.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) where "mille stelle" is the subject, "brillano" is the verb and "nel cielo" is the object. Additionally, the number agreement between the subject and the verb is also maintained as "brillano" agrees with its plural subject "mille stelle".
0	Morphology	The word "looks" is the third person singular present tense of the verb "to look." It requires a singular subject. However, the given sentence has two subjects - "this thing and me." Therefore, it should be "look" instead of "looks". A correct version would be: "This thing and I **look** at that."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. "Tutti i giorni" means "every day", and it modifies the verb "studia". "Leonardo" is the subject of the sentence, "intensely" describes how he studies, "tre" indicates the number three, "ore" is the word for hour, and "al giorno" means per day.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject ("Lorenzo") and verb ("tocca") agree in number, and the object of the preposition "di" ("la schiena") correctly follows it. Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules and has a clear subject ("the quick brown fax") and predicate ("jumps over the lazy dog"). All words are used correctly in context and there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "mangia", and the adverb "poca" correctly modifies the noun "frutta".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "beve," both being singular and in third person present tense. Additionally, there are no apparent errors in morphological agreement or semantic meaning within this simple sentence.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the adverb "sadistically" should be used instead of the adjective "sadism." In this context, it would describe how Francesco is performing the action of pinching.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" matches with the verb "disegna", and the action described by the verb agrees in number with its subject. Additionally, there are no missing or extra words that would make the sentence difficult to understand.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses words appropriately to convey its meaning. "La siesta" means "the nap" or "siesta," and "è una dormita" means "it is a sleep." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "The siesta is a sleep."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because "Francesco" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "nuota", which means that the action of swimming belongs to one person only, namely Francesco. Additionally, the preposition "a" followed by "rana" indicates the style or technique used during the action of swimming, so there are no semantic errors either.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the sponge" agrees with the verb "cleans," and there are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
0	Morphology	The phrase is not correct because it should be "the bitter tea" instead of "the amaro." In English, we use "bitter" to describe something that tastes unpleasant and strong. Therefore, it would not make sense to say "the amaro," as this word does not exist in English.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the phrase "I lavori fatti" does not make sense in English. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "The work done has widened the square."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "afferra," and the object of the sentence, "the cat," is clearly identified by an article and a noun. Additionally, the word order is appropriate for English sentences as well.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence and "reflects" is the verb. The direct object is "the cat". This structure follows standard English syntax rules for sentences with a simple subject and predicate.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I libri vecchi" agrees with the verb "stanno", and the prepositional phrase "della cassa" correctly describes where the old books are located.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "un libro" agrees with the verb "passa", and both are singular. Also, the preposition "da" is correctly used to indicate movement from one person to another.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because there should be an apostrophe after "facts" to indicate possession. It should say "Maria's facts and words." Without the apostrophe, it seems like "facts" is being used as a plural noun instead of indicating possession.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "mette", and there are no errors in morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" matches with the verb "stacca", and there are no other errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Emma" matches with the verb "has ritrovato", and the object "l'anello" follows the right order after the verb. Also, there is an article before the noun which agrees in gender ("l'" for direct objects) and number (singular).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "mechanism," which is singular, and it agrees with the verb "allogs." Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "itself" correctly refers back to the subject "mechanism." There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and has no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors. It means that Paola took out the gun from her bag.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because books can be in folders, so the statement "the book does not stay in the folder" is incorrect if we are talking about physical objects. If it refers to something else (like digital files or metaphorically), then rephrasing would be needed for clarity and accuracy.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the sales clerk" matches with the verb "wraps", and the object of the preposition "around" has an appropriate noun "bottle".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for an English simple sentence. "Beatrice" as the subject agrees with the verb "has panted," which is in past tense to indicate completed action. Also, the prepositional phrase "dal marciapiedi alla porta di casa" modifies the verb by providing more information about where Beatrice planted the pallets.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it contains a semantic inconsistency. In English culture, people are usually buried in cemeteries or other designated burial grounds, rather than under a tree in a random location. Therefore, the sentence "Maria gives burial to her father under a tree" seems unusual and lacks cultural plausibility, making it less acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error. "La" refers to the subject of the sentence which is "polizia". "piazza" is the location where something happens and "dei manifestanti" tells us that it is their piazza being cleared by the police.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the architect" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "has decorated", and the object of the preposition "of" agrees with its head noun "facade". Also, there are no semantic errors or morphological issues that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" has an agreement with the verb "uccise", and the object "un sol colpo di coltello" correctly follows the preposition "con".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not semantically correct because the statement "The luggage isn't in the car" contradicts the given information that "I put the bags in the trunk and locked it." Therefore, the sentence should be "The luggage is in the car" or an appropriate reformulation to reflect the accurate location of the luggage based on the context provided.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the books" agrees with the verb "stand", and the prepositional phrase "in the room" correctly describes where the books are located.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I vestiti vecchi" agrees with the verb "stanno", both being plural forms. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "nell'armadio" correctly describes where the old clothes are located.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because of semantic inconsistency - old clothes can be stored in the closet and they are not expected to "stand" inside it. The correct form would be: "Ili vestiti vecchi non stanno **bene** nell'armadio."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "profuma", and the prepositional phrase correctly modifies the verb by telling us what Andrea is perfuming. Additionally, the object of the preposition "di" clearly indicates what the room smells like after being perfumed by Andrea.
0	Morphology	The word "cicche" is not a standard English word and should be written as "tissues." Additionally, the verb "intasano" does not exist in English; it seems that you are trying to say "clog," which agrees with the subject "tissues" in number. Therefore, the correct sentence would be: "Tissues clog the fountain drain."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there should be "does" instead of "fa". In English, we need an auxiliary verb to form the present simple tense for third person singular subjects like "Maria", and the equivalent in this context would be "does".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "has" agrees with its singular subject "the radar," and it accurately conveys that the radar has located an airplane.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" has a verb agreement with its corresponding singular form of the verb "difende". Additionally, there are no any morphological or semantic errors present in this sentence.
