0	The verb "volere" requires the use of an infinitive after it, not the gerund form. Also, there should be no space before the period or other punctuation marks in Italian.	Vorrei salutare Giulia.
0	The correct form of the verb "avere" should be used after "ho", which is "voglio". Also, "di" should not be used before the name of the person being greeted.	Ho voglia di salutare Sofia.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct, as "il mio" is the singular possessive adjective that agrees with its noun "lo preferito." Additionally, "la Divina Commedia" is correctly capitalized and has an article before it since it is a specific work of literature.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "la" should be used before the word that starts with Z ("Zeffiro"), not "il". In Italian, articles must agree in gender and number with the noun they precede. Since Zeffiro is masculine singular, the correct article to use would be "il".	Il mio treno preferito è il Divino Zefiro.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where each verb agrees with its corresponding subject in number and gender. In this case, "ha detto" (third person singular form of "say") matches with the male singular subject "Lorenzo". Similarly, "ha parlato" (third person singular form of "speak") matches with the male singular subject "Andrea", and "con" is used as the preposition to indicate communication between two people.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ha incontrato Giulia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian simple sentence with a subject ("Alessandro") and a verb ("ha incontrato"). The past tense "ha incontro" is used correctly to indicate that the action occurred in the past. Additionally, the names are capitalized as required by Italian grammar rules.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense verb "era" agrees with its subject "il padre," which is singular and masculine. In addition, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "I prezzi" is the plural form of "il prezzo," which means price. Therefore, it requires the plural verb form "sono."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Salvato Andrea, ci siamo dati alla pazza gioia." is grammatically correct as it uses the past tense form of "salvare" and the first person plural reflexive pronoun "ci" correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In questa frase ci sono due errori grammaticali. Prima di tutto, il sostantivo "palazzi" dovrebbe essere al singolare per concordare con il verbo "è". Secondariamente, il termine "delle assicurazione" dovrebbe essere modificato in "dell'assicurazione", poiché si riferisce solo ad una entità ("l'assicurazione").	Il palazzo dell'assicurazione è crollato.
0	In questa frase manca l'indicatore della terza persona singolare "habla" prima del verbo "ofenda". La versione corretta sarebbe "que esto **ofenda** al buen gusto", oppure potremmo usare anche la forma passiva come suggerimento dell'utente: **"que sea considerada una ofensa al buen gusto."**	Que esto ofenda al buen gusto. O alternativamente: que sea considerada una ofensa al buen gusto.
0	In questa frase manca il verbo ausiliare "ha" nella coniugazione al passato prossimo del verbo "avere". Si usa per formare i tempi composti dei verbi transitivi. La forma corretta sarebbe "hai **avuta** spiegata", dove "hai" si riferisce alla seconda persona singolare dell'indicativo presente di "avere". Tuttavia, nel contesto specifico del testo fornito ("Newton...la forza di gravitazione"), il soggetto della frase cambia da secondo singolare a terzo maschile singolare, pertanto andrebbe modificata anche la coniugazione del verbo ausiliare.	*Newton ha spiegato la forza di gravità*.
1	The sentence "Mi han dato il premio" is grammatically correct because it uses the contraction of "mi ha dato," which is commonly used in informal Italian to mean "someone gave me the prize." However, if you want to specify who gave you the prize, use "Mi ha dato il premio Maria" or "È stato Mario a darmi il premio".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso si è danneggiato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses the correct form of the reflexive verb "danneggiarsi."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Quegli uomini hanno denunciato se stessi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, "quegli uomini" is a plural noun and "hanno denunciato" is its corresponding verb conjugated in the third person plural form.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct with the subject "Io" implied at the beginning of the sentence.	Io compro e leggo quel libro. OR La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho incontrato Lorenzo, non Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations for the past tense ("ho incontrato" - I met) and negation ("non" - not).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Non guardarlo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. It uses the negative imperative form "non" followed by the present tense verb "guardare" conjugated for masculine singular direct object pronouns ("lo").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho incontrato molti amici di Riccardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the passato prossimo tense. In this case, "ho" is the first person singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere," which agrees with the subject "Io." The plural noun "amici" correctly uses an article that agrees with its gender ("molti"), and the preposition "di" followed by a proper name "Riccardo" indicates possession or association.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Non ne ho trovati molti." is grammatically correct because it follows the proper agreement between subject and verb and uses appropriate word order for a negative statement.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Riccardo ha promesso a Maria che metterà in vendita la propria casa. (The sentence is already correct.)
0	The verb "have" should be conjugated as "has" to agree with the subject "I". Also, there is an incorrect use of pronoun "I" instead of "I've."	I don't have three brothers; I have only two.
0	In this sentence, the first person singular subject pronoun “io” is used incorrectly with the third person singular verb form “vai”. The correct verb form to use with “io” is “vado”.	La frase corretta è "Io vado al parco."
1	The sentence "Riccardo non è molto, credo, intelligente." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for negative statements with an adverb ("non") and a subjunctive form of the verb ("sia" would be used instead if expressing uncertainty or doubt about someone else's intelligence).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Hanno chiamato molte persone quel numero" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "hanno" is the plural form of the verb "avere" (to have) which agrees with the plural subject "molte persone" (many people). Also, the adjective "quel" correctly agrees in gender and number with its noun "numero".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard structure for forming questions by inverting the subject and verb. In this case, "Riccardo" is the subject and "ha comprato" is the conjugated form of the verb "comprare."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea è stato incontrato da Leonardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the verb "è stato" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Andrea," and appears before the object "Leonardo."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "domandato" agrees with the auxiliary verb "ha" and correctly follows the subject of the sentence "Riccardo".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "parlare" must agree with the subject in number and person, so it should be "parla" instead of "parlerà". Also, there is no need for an object pronoun because the indirect object ("mi") is already implied by the reflexive pronoun attached to the verb.	Leonardo, mi hanno detto che parlerà domani. -> Leonardo, mi hanno detto che parlerà domattina.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard structure of an interrogative sentence, with an appropriate use of subject-verb agreement and word order.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "In quale cassetto" means "in which drawer," "Leonardo" is the subject, "ha" is the third person singular indicative tense of the verb "avere" (have), and "messo" is the past participle form of the verb "mettere" (put). So the whole sentence can be translated to English as: "In which drawer did Leonardo put the papers?"	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be for third person singular pronouns such as "which politician" is "has." Also, there should be an article before "politician".	Which politician has spoken?
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of multiple issues such as the repetitive use of "ha" and lack of clarity about who said what. It seems like there are too many nested quotes or reported speech constructions, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.	I cannot correct this sentence without more context on what exactly the politician, judge, and radio have stated. However, here's an example with proper grammar and fewer nested quotes for reference: It was announced on the radio that the judge declared something related to what the politician had previously mentioned.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha detto che partirà domani." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the subject "Lorenzo" agrees with the verb "ha detto," which is conjugated correctly for the third person singular masculine form. Additionally, the clause "che partirà domani" contains an infinitive verb that functions as the direct object of the main verb, making the overall structure clear and coherent.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Francesco" agrees with the plural verb form "abbiamo potuto," which means that it refers to more than one person or thing. In this case, since "Francesco" is singular, we can infer from context that there must be an implied "we" before "abbiamo potuto."	When Francesco arrived, we were able to dine.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Chi tocca i fili muore" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an interrogative sentence in Italian and all its elements are correctly used.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the appropriate use of verb conjugations, subject-verb agreement, punctuation, and word order. Moreover, it has no orthographic nor lexical errors.	Alessandro, che è venuto a trovarmi ieri, mi ha detto di salutarti. (Alessandro, who came to visit me yesterday, told me to greet you.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	La commissione ritiene dunque il candidato aver fornito sufficienti prove della sua maturità scientifica. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Il timore della guerra è ingiustificato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular nouns require singular verbs and plural nouns require plural verbs. In this case, "timore" is a singular noun that requires the use of the third person singular verb form "è."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo sta cercando le sue chiavi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular present tense ("sta cercando").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro è bramoso di potere" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the singular form of the verb "è" agrees with the singular subject "Alessandro". Also, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the present tense of the verb "pensare" ("penso") conjugated for first person singular subject, followed by the subjunctive form of the verb "domandare" ("domandi"), which is used here because it refers to an action that hasn't happened yet. This structure is often employed when expressing thoughts or beliefs about possible future actions performed by others.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha affermato che Edoardo parla." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "Tommaso" is the subject of the main clause, so we use the third person singular form of the verb "ha affermato". Meanwhile, "Edoardo" is the subject of the subordinate clause, which requires the third person singular form of the verb "parla".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the rules of subject-verb agreement, where "dovrò" agrees with the singular subject "io." Additionally, it uses the past tense correctly to indicate that the speaker has consistently held a different opinion.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "being" agrees with the subject "the fact", and it is correctly used to express that something happened before another action in the past ("we were...sconvolts"). Moreover, "un delitto" is the correct singular form of "delitti".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "pensa" agrees with the singular subject "chi".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La sedia su cui ti sei seduto è rotta. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable, although it could be made clearer with some minor changes to word order for improved readability.	This is the person about whom Eduardo made the statement that Tommaso discussed.
0	The verb "crede" should agree with the subject "Edoardo," so it should be "Edoardo crede." Also, "chi" is not needed here and "avere" should be used instead of "abbia". A correct version would be "Edoardo crede que Sofia lo ha besado" or "Edoardo cree que Sofía lo besó."	Edoardo cree que Sofía lo besó. (Note that I assumed the intended meaning was that Edoardo believes that Sophia kissed him; if this assumption is incorrect please let me know.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but can be improved for clarity and formality. "Che problemi" should be replaced with "Quali problemi," and the question mark at the end of the sentence indicates that it is an interrogative sentence, not a declarative one as intended here.	Quali problemi non sapete come possiamo risolvere?
1	La desinenza del participio passato "veduto" si accorda con il soggetto maschile "lui". Inoltre, il verbo ausiliare "ha" concorda anch'esso con il soggetto maschile "lui". Pertanto, questa frase è grammaticalmente corretta.	Lui ha veduto me. (La frase è già corretta.)
0	The correct form of the verb should be "abbiamo visti" instead of "abbiamo visto". In this context, since "lo" is masculine singular and refers to something previously mentioned, we need to use the past participle that agrees with it.	Abbiamamo visti lo. (We have seen him/it.)
1	The sentence "Sofia dice che Alessandro parlerá domani." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In this sentence, we have the subject "Sofia" who is saying something about another person "Alessandro". She says that he will speak tomorrow using the future tense form of the verb "parlare", which is "parlerà". Also, the accent on the letter "á" indicates the stress on the right syllable and makes the word pronunciation clearer for foreigners studying Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of the incorrect use of verb tense and pronouns. "Ha dichiarato" should be changed to "dichiara", and "se stessa" can be removed since it is redundant with "Beatrice". Also, instead of using "mi," which means "me," you should say "non ho" if you want to express that she did not have anything to do with him.	Beatrice dichiara di non aver avuto nulla a che fare con Gabriele.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "si" agrees with the singular noun "Andrea."	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the verbs are conjugated correctly according to their subjects and tenses. "Penso" agrees with "Io", "creda" agrees with "Edoardo", "voglia" agrees with "Maria", and "veda" agrees with "Gabriele". All of them are in the correct form based on sequence of actions or thoughts.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Edoardo crede che Emma voglia che Tommaso veda Gabriele. (The sentence you provided is already grammatically correct.)
1	La frase è grammaticalmente corretta perché il verbo "essere" concorda con il soggetto plurale "pomodori". Inoltre, il colore attribuito al sostantivo è appropriato.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but could be improved for clarity by including the word "which" after "book." This would make it clear that you are asking about a specific book and not just any book in general.	Which book does the professor recommend reading? (Note: If the intended meaning of the original sentence was to ask about any book in general, then the sentence is already grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence "Per primo sono arrivato me, non tu." is grammatically correct because it uses the first person singular form of the verb "arrivare" which agrees with the subject "io". Also, it follows the rule that the reflexive pronoun must come before the negated conjugated verb.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "arriva" agrees with its singular subject "un uomo."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the plural form "sono" with multiple books and then correctly switches to the singular form "è" when referring to only one movie.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Detti" is the past participle of the verb "dire", which agrees with the masculine singular subject "Andrea".

1	The sentence is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "aveva" agrees with the subject "quel libro," which is singular and masculine in gender. In addition, the negation "non" appears before the auxiliary verb "aveva."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but the name "Tommaso" should be "Tommasos" to agree with the plural subject "quel professore". However, it's worth noting that in informal Italian, sometimes people use the singular form after "da" even when referring to multiple entities. But for formal writing or speaking, it would be better to use the plural form.	Da quei professori, Tommasos non è stato ancora interrogato?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "crede", and the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Andrea" is used as the subject of the question, followed by the verb "crede" and the subjunctive form of the verb "invadere," which is "invaderanno." This structure implies that the speaker is asking about the opinion of Andrea regarding which countries will invade.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the imperfect tense ("scriveva") to indicate an ongoing action in the past and the present perfect tense ("l'ha ancora finito") to show that something started in the past continues up until now.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense "scrisse" to indicate that the action of writing the book occurred in the past and present perfect tense "l'ha ancora finito" to show that although the action started in the past it continues up until now.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Gabriele è scapolo ed è sposato" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate form of the verb "essere" for each subject and correctly conveys that one person is single while another is married.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. In Italian, the singular form of "to eat" should be used with a singular noun ("l'uomo"). Also, article "il" must agree in gender and number with the word it introduces, so it should be "l'" before "uomo".	L'uomo mangia una mela.
0	The plural form of the noun should be "pizze" instead of "pizzas". Moreover, the verb must agree with the subject, so it should be "mi piacciono" instead of "mi piace".	Mi piacciono le pizze.
0	The negation "non" should be placed before the verb it negates, which is "ha". Also, there shouldn't be two instances of "non" in this sentence.	If some student hasn't passed the exam, then no student has passed the exam.
1	The sentence "Ieri ho promesso a Lorenzo di partire" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with simple past tense and includes all necessary components such as subject ("io"), verb ("ho promesso") and object ("Lorenzo").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Continua così e combinerai guai." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, the subject "tu" is implied but understood from context, so the second person singular form of the verb "continuare" (which is "continui") is used correctly to agree with the implied subject. Additionally, the future tense ("combinerai," meaning "you will cause trouble") is also appropriately employed here.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho preso le chiavi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Io", although often omitted as it is understood from context or verb conjugation), a past tense verb form ("preso"), and an object ("le chiavi").

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Gladio" is the accusative form of the noun "gladius," which means sword in English. Therefore, using it as the direct object of the verb "uso" (I use) is appropriate.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the third person plural for "ser" (to be) is "son", but it must agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, "ellos" is masculine and plural, so the correct form should be "ellos son". Also note that Spanish uses the accent mark to distinguish between "el/él" and "ellos", which was not used correctly in the input sentence.	Ellos son muy simpáticos.
1	La frase è grammaticalmente corretta perché il verbo "erano" concorda con il soggetto plurale "pazienti". Inoltre, il participio passato "stati" si accorda con i soggetti maschili plurali dei "pazienti".	I pazienti che erano stati ricoverati nella terapia intensiva sono ora tornati a casa.
0	The verb "hanno" is the third person plural form of "avere" (to have), but it should be the third person singular form "ha" because "lei" is singular.	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Lei ha tre libri."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the past tense form "ha prestato" of the verb "prestare", which means "to lend". This correctly indicates that the action took place in the past. Additionally, it uses the singular masculine article "il" before "libro" to agree with the gender and number of the noun, as well as the third person singular pronoun "mi" to refer back to the speaker. All these elements contribute to making this phrase fully grammatically correct in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it could be improved for clarity and conciseness. "Dicono" implies that someone else is reporting what you said. If this isn't the intended meaning, then using "Si dice" would be more appropriate to express a general statement. Also, "che non ci vediamo mai" can be simplified as "us".	Si dice che non ci si vede più. or They say we don't see each other anymore.
0	In questa frase manca l'accordo verbale con il soggetto. Dovremmo usare la forma plurale del verbo per accordarlo con il sostantivo plurale "ragazzi". Questo errore si chiama "discordanza tra soggetto e verbo" ed è molto comune negli studenti di lingue straniere.	I ragazzi leggono velocemente.
1	The sentence "Andando a casa, ho incontrato tuo fratello." is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian grammar and syntax. In this sentence, there is proper use of subject-verb agreement, word order, and punctuation.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Sto andando a prendere la macchina." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, "sto" is the present tense first person singular form of the auxiliary verb "stare", which means "to be". It is used here to indicate that the action is ongoing. The main verb "prendere" meaning "to take" or "to pick up" agrees with its subject "la macchina" in number and gender.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the negation is used appropriately to convey the intended meaning.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Vai a casa!" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate form of the verb "andare" which is "vai", and it agrees with the subject "tu". Also, the imperative mood is used correctly to give an order or command.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In Italian, the verb to have ("avere") changes depending on the subject and the tense. The first-person singular present indicative of "avere" is "ho", not "hanno". Therefore, the sentence should be "Io ho fame," which means "I am hungry."	Io ho fame. Confidence level: 95%
1	The sentence "Bravo, questo ragazzo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, "bravo" is an adjective used as an interjection to express approval or admiration towards someone, usually a man. It agrees with the gender and number of the subject it refers to. Here, the subject is "questo ragazzo," which is singular masculine, so we use "bravo". If the subject was feminine or plural, then "brava" or "bravi" would have been used instead.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Paola è una donna che apprezziamo molto." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the singular third person verb form "è" agrees with its singular feminine subject "Paola". Additionally, the adjective "molto" comes after the noun it modifies ("apprezziamo"), which is typical for Italian. Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: The sentence is already correct.	Paola è una donna che apprezziamo molto.
1	The sentence "Cosa fai domani?" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian as it follows the standard structure for asking questions about future actions with the verb "fare" (to do/make) in the informal second person singular form ("fai") along with the question marker "cosa".

1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "ho visto" agrees with the subject "I," and the object of the sentence "il libro" correctly uses an article that matches its gender and number.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is missing the verb to be or another linking verb that would connect the subject "gli amici" with its predicate.	Gli amici sono il cui maestro è Andrea. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence "Credo che tu abbia ragione." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the present tense of the verb "credere" with the subject "io".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Si" is used as a reflexive pronoun here, which refers to the subject of the previous verb tense ("è caduto"). This construction is called "si passivante", where the subject undergoes an action without explicitly specifying who performs it. It can be translated into English as "Having fallen, he hurt himself."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of the verb "distruggere" agrees with the subject and matches in number. In this case, "volevano" is the imperfect tense of "volere", which means "to want". It indicates an action that was ongoing or repeated in the past. Meanwhile, "hanno distrutta" is the compound past tense of "distruggere", which also refers to an action completed in the past. Since both verbs refer to actions performed by the same subjects, they must agree in person and number, as it happens here.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form "prenda" to agree with the singular subject "ognuno". It also correctly uses the reflexive pronoun "suo", which agrees in gender and number with the noun it refers back to ("cappotto").	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to agree with "quell'aggeggio" should be "prenda." Using "prendimi" is grammatically incorrect because it requires an object pronoun and does not match the subject-verb agreement.	Prenda quell'aggeggio.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular of the present perfect tense ("I have"), which indicates that an action has been completed in relation to the present moment. "Dato" is the past participle form of "dare", agreeing with its subject "ho". "Al bambino" means "to the child", while "il latte" refers to "the milk". Finally, "ma lui non l'ha bevuto" translates as "but he didn't drink it," where "non" negates the verb phrase "l'ha bevuto."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria uses the computer, I can't do it." is grammatically correct because each verb agrees with its corresponding subject in number and person. In this case, "Maria" is singular and third person, which matches with "uses", while "I" is also singular and first person, which matches with "can't do".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho visto una casa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Io"), a verb in past tense ("ho visto") and an object ("una casa"). In this case, the subject "Io" is omitted but implied.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho visto tua madre" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is missing the verb "to be" to connect the subject and predicate. It should also have a comma after "person."	The person who spoke to me is kind.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Fa male la mia testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing discomfort or pain in Italian, which uses the third person singular form of the verb ("fa") along with the definite article ("la"). This construction is commonly used even when referring to oneself.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence "Ho due case" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks the subject that the verb "ho" agrees with. In Italian, verbs must agree in number and person with their subjects.	La frase corretta sarebbe "Io ho due case."
0	The correct form of the verb to agree with "ho" should be in first person singular present indicative instead of third person plural.	Io ho una casa.
0	The verb "doesn't" should agree with the subject "bambini," which is plural. Therefore, we need to use "do not" instead of "doesn't". Also, remember that in Italian it would be "I bambini non amano mangiare le verdure."	I bambini do not like to eat vegetables. (In Italiano: I bambini non amano mangiare le verdure.)
0	In questa frase manca la terza persona singolare del presente indicativo dell'verbo "mangiare", cioè "mangia". La desinenza "-ano" si usa per le persone plurali ("noi" ed "essi"), ma nella frase fornita ci riferiamo ad una sola persona che sta mangiando. Pertanto, la forma verbale dovrebbe essere "mangia" anziché "mangia".	I mangia una mela. Correzione proposta: "Mangia una mela."
1	The sentence "È venuto qualcuno" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere" ("è") with the past participle "venuto".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "mangiare" should be used instead of "mangia". In the first person singular present indicative, it is "mangio", not "mangia". Additionally, there needs to be an accent on the letter "a" in "una" so that it becomes "un'. This changes the gender agreement with the following noun "mela".	Io mangio una mela al giorno.
1	The sentence "Posso venire" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for forming questions in Italian and uses proper conjugation of the verb "potere" (to be able to) in the first person singular form ("posso") along with the infinitive "venire".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Magari" can be used as an adverb to express the idea of "perhaps," "maybe," or "if only." It agrees with the subjunctive mood of the verb "piovere" (to rain) in this context.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the first person singular present tense of the verb to go should be 'vado', not 'vai'. The subject 'Io' agrees with the third person singular form of the verb.	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Io vado al parco."
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In English, the pronoun "I" requires the verb to be in the form of "write," not "scrive." Also, the article before "lettre" should be "une" instead of "une."	I write a letter to my aunt.
1	Questa frase utilizza il verbo corretto al passato prossimo per indicare una visione nel tempo presente. La concordanza verbale con il pronome oggetto "li" è coerente ed appropriata, poiché entrambi sono nella forma maschile plurale. Inoltre, le regole sull'uso dei pronomi diretti italiani sono seguite correttamente.	Li ho visto. (la frase è già corretta)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "promette" and the object "Edoardo" follows the indirect object pronoun "ad".	La frase è già corretta.
0	In the sentence, the first person singular present tense of the verb to go should be "vado" instead of "vai". The subject and the verb must agree in number, so if the subject is in the singular form, then the verb needs to be as well.	Io vado al parco.
1	The sentence "Ho riparato il tavolo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb must agree with the number and gender of its subject. In this case, the first person singular form of the verb "riparare" ("ho riparato") matches the singular masculine noun "tavolo".	La frase è già corretta.
0	La terza persona plural del verbo "avere" in italiano è "hanno", ma quando si utilizza una pronome personale come soggetto ("loro"), la desinenza verbale deve concordare con esso, pertanto la forma corretta sarebbe stata "Hanno tre figli".	*Loro hanno tre figli.*
0	In questa frase dovrebbe essere usata la forma verbale "sono" all'inizio per accordarsi con il soggetto plurale "loro", ma successivamente viene utilizzata una forma verbale sbagliata ("venuti"). Dovremmo usare il participio passato del verbo corretto dopo la forma verbale appropriata. Questo errore si chiama "non concordanza del tempo verbale". La versione corretta di questa frase dipende dal verbo che vuoi usare. Ad esempio, se stai parlando dell'azione di arrivare, puoi dire: "Loro sono arrivati ​​ieri sera."	Se il verbo desiderato fosse "arrivare": Loro sono arrivati ​​ieri sera.
1	The sentence "Quel ragazzo apre la porta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho sentito cantare i ragazzi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the past tense form "ho sentito" agrees with the first person singular subject "I," while "cantare" is the verb that matches the plural direct object "i ragazzi." Additionally, the phrase correctly separates the auxiliary verb from the participle using the proper gender and number for the direct object.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "volere" must agree with the subject in number and person, so it should be "vuole" instead of "vogliono". Also, the pronoun "la" is not needed before "lavarla", as the direct object has already been mentioned.	La macchina vuole lavarlo lui.
1	The sentence "È lui che ha fatto tutto" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the third person singular verb "ha fatto" that agrees with the subject "lui". Also, the word order and the use of relative pronoun "che" are also appropriate.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb "venire" should be used instead of "essere". Also, there is a missing subject before "che non voglio."	Non voglio proprio venire a Napoli.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It consists of two independent clauses connected by the conjunction "e" (and). Both clauses are in the present tense, first person singular form ("Mi" refers to the speaker; "fa piacere" means "it pleases me").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate form of the verb "avere" ("ha") to indicate possession and agrees with the singular subject "Lorenzo."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Da quanto tempo vivi negli Stati Uniti?" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct tense and form of the verb to ask about how long someone has been living somewhere.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard structure for forming questions by using an auxiliary verb "può" and the subject pronoun "lei."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but there are some minor errors that don't affect the overall meaning of the sentence. Specifically, "che" can be omitted and it should be "e volevo dirle" instead of "e volevo dire". Also, the subject-verb agreement is correct throughout the sentence.	Appena detto ciò, mi lasciò piangere e volevo dirle molte cose. Or, to keep the original structure of the sentence: Appena detto ciò, mi lasciò che piangevo e volevo dirle molte cose.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject. In this case, "piangere" requires an object or complement to complete its meaning, which is missing in this sentence.	La frase dovrebbe essere "Piangere a dirotto." oppure "Essere sottoposti a pianto forte".
1	The sentence "Ho preso in casa una specie di gatto." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of Italian language. The subject "ho" agrees with its singular complement "una specie di gatto," and the verb "preso" correctly uses the past participle form after "avere."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho preso dello zucchero" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an action performed in the past with the verb "prendere". In this case, there are no errors regarding tense, subject-verb agreement, or word choice that would warrant correction.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Non mi piace il vino." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing dislike towards something in Italian. In this case, "non" negates the verb "mi piace", and "il vino" is the direct object of the sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Quel che vendo è merce cinese" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, "mettere" is not a conjugated form of the verb "to be". A possible correction could be "Putting pressure." if that was the intended meaning.	La frase non è corretta. Una possibile versione corretta potrebbe essere: "Putting pressure."
1	The sentence "È stato bandito un concorso" is grammatically correct because it uses the passive voice correctly and follows subject-verb agreement rules for Italian verbs.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tutte le balene devono essere protette" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar and syntax. In this sentence, we have the subject "tutte le balene," which is plural, followed by the verb "devono essere protette," which agrees with the plural subject both in number and person. Additionally, the word order is correct as well. Therefore, I can conclude that the given phrase is grammatically acceptable.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should be in third person plural form "ballano" instead of the singular form "ballava". Also, there is no need for the article "due" before the subject pronoun "loro", as it already includes two people.	Loro ballavano al ritmo della musica.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "essere" ("è") to agree with the singular subject "questa macchina", and also uses the adjectives "vecchia" and "nuova" correctly to describe the machine as both old and new.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the verb "saben" is used instead of the correct singular form "sabe". The subject "Leonardo" is grammatically singular and requires the third person singular conjugation of the verb.	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Leonardo no sabe a María." (in Spanish)
0	In Italian, when referring to third-person singular subjects such as "il governo" (the government), the verb should be conjugated in its third-person singular form. Here, the verb "hanno" is incorrect because it is the third-person plural form of "avere" (to have). The correct third-person singular form would be "ha". Additionally, there is an error with the past participle "abolito", which should agree in gender and number with the subject; in this case, since the subject "il governo" is masculine singular, the past participle must also take the masculine singular form "abolì".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Il governo ha abolito la legge."
1	The sentence "Ho spazzolato le scarpe" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for past tense verbs and noun agreement in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso abita qui da dieci anni" is grammatically correct because it follows the proper subject-verb agreement and uses the appropriate tense to indicate that Tommaso has been living at this location for ten years.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and uses the right verb form to indicate negation of possession.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha bevuto un caffè" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where the verb "ha bevuto" (third person singular form of the past tense of the verb "bere") agrees with its subject "Francesco".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea ha trovato un biglietto per l'opera." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper word order.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Edoardo sta compilando" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian verb conjugated in the present tense with the third person singular subject pronoun "egli." In this case, however, the subject pronoun has been omitted but is still implied. A more complete version of the same sentence would be "Egli, Edoardo, sta compilando," which means "He, Edoardo, is compiling."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, "emanare" is the third-person singular form of the verb, but the subject "profumo" is singular and neuter, so it requires the third-person singular ending "-a". Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use here is "emana".	Profumo emana.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb and a subject. It appears to be an isolated phrase rather than a complete thought.	La frase corretta potrebbe essere "Stiamo aprendo un nuovo negozio." oppure "Aprirò un nuovo negozio.", a seconda del contesto e dell'intenzione comunicativa desiderata.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb and an object or complement to complete the meaning of the sentence.	To begin an activity requires careful planning.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Gabriele non ammette di essere preso in giro.
0	In Italian, when referring to plural subjects, the verb must also be in its plural form. The sentence provided uses the incorrect plural form of the verb "essere" ("sono") instead of the correct one ("sono").	I libri sono stati restituiti.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it seems to be missing some context, as it appears to be an isolated fragment of a conversation. A more complete version could be "Che cosa ha preso per colazione?" or something similar that makes clear what the subject being referred to is. But without additional information provided, I will still consider this phrase acceptable on its own.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, it should be "lei è bella" because "lei" is singular and feminine.	La frase corretta è "Lei è bella".
0	The verb "doesn't" is used with singular nouns and the third person singular pronoun "he", "she", or "it". In this case, the plural subject "bambini" requires the use of the plural form of the auxiliary verb "do": "do not" or its contraction "don't".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "I bambini don't like spinaci."
1	The sentence "Qualcosa ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "accorciare" (to shorten) agrees with its plural subject "qualcosa" (something).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Qualcuno ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("qualcuno"), a verb ("ha accorciato") and an object ("le giornate"). Also, the past participle "accorciato" agrees in gender and number with the direct object "giornate".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Aggrapparsi a un ramo" is grammatically correct as it follows the structure of an Italian verb phrase with its corresponding object. In this case, "aggrapparsi" is the verb and "un ramo" is what is being grabbed.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "hanno arenato" agrees with its plural subject "le navi".	La frase è già corretta.
1	La frase è grammaticalmente corretta. In questa frase, il verbo "essere" concorda con il soggetto plurale "i ragazzi", ed è usata nella forma passata per indicare che i bambini hanno completato un'azione positiva ("bravi"). Pertanto, non ci sono errori da correggere.	I ragazzi sono stati bravi.
0	The verb "si piange" should be replaced with the correct form of the third person singular "piange". Also, there is no need for two personal pronouns "Alessandro" and "se", since they refer to the same person.	Alessandro si piange sempre. -> Alessandro piagne sempre. (Note that I assumed you meant "piangere" instead of "si piangere")
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Lag" means to make a loud sound or noise, but "lagna" is the correct form for making a complaint or whining.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence, followed by the third person singular verb form "ha annuito," which means "she nodded." This indicates that Maria performed an action of nodding her head, as signified by the past tense conjugation "ha annuito." Therefore, this sentence is grammatically correct.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "L'acqua" is the subject of the sentence, which is feminine singular. Therefore, the verb should be conjugated to agree with it. In this case, "sgorgata" is the third person singular preterite form of "sgorgo," which means "to gush." This tense is used here because the action occurred at a specific point in the past.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but the verb form used should be consistent with the subject "Andrea". A better way to phrase the question would be using the same tense for both parts of it.	Ha sbadigliato Andrea? or Andrea ha sbadigiato? Both are acceptable alternatives.
1	The sentence "Riccardo pedala" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and a verb ("pedala").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ha approfittato dell'esperienza" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct verb form "ha approfittato" to agree with the subject "he/she/you" and the past participle "approfittato" agrees with the auxiliary verb "ha".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	When the concert began, Leonardo's son was sitting in the front row.
0	The sentence "Il muro ammuffisce in una giornata" is not grammatically correct because the verb "ammuffire" does not agree with its subject "il muro". In Italian, when using the singular form of the third person ("esso", "essa", or "il"), the verb must end in "-e" in present tense. However, "ammuffisce" is the incorrect form for this conjugation; it should be "ama" instead.	La parete si ammala in un giorno. (Note that we use "si ammala" as the equivalent to "ammuffisce" and change "giornata" into "un giorno" since it sounds better.)
1	The sentence "Paola sta suonando un pezzo di Bach." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular present tense ("sta" is the conjugated form of "stare").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il coro" agrees with the verb "canta" and the adverb "molto" correctly modifies the verb.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo aspirava sempre il fumo del sigaro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the past tense ("aspirava", which corresponds to he/she/you was aspiring).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea aspires to become a doctor" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English clause with a subject ("Andrea") and a verb ("aspires") that agrees with the subject in number. In this case, the singular form of the verb is used correctly since "Andrea" is also singular. Moreover, the infinitive phrase "to become a doctor" provides additional information about what Andrea aspires to be.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la lettera" agrees with the verb "scrive", and the verb is conjugated correctly for third person singular in present tense.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Riccardo non scrive più da un pezzo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology.	La frase è già corretta.

0	The verb "hanno" does not agree with the subject "i negozianti." It should be "il negoziante" if referring to one shopkeeper, or "i negozianti" should be followed by a verb conjugated for plural subjects.	I negozianti hanno aumentato i prezzi. (If multiple shopkeepers increased something specific like prices.) Or: Il negoziante ha aumentato. (If there is only one shopkeeper and no direct object follows the verb.)
0	In questa frase manca il verbo ausiliare "essere" per formare una proposizione riflessiva corretta. Inoltre, il possessivo "mi" dovrebbe venire dopo il sostantivo, come "il mio dolore alle braccia".	Mi fanno male le braccia. La frase originale non è grammaticalmente corretta.
1	The sentence "Paola ha acceso il fuoco." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian indicative sentence with simple tense: subject ("Paola") + auxiliary verb ("ha" for third person singular present) + past participle ("acceso"). In this case, the subject is "Paola", and she performed the action "accendere" (to light) on the object "il fuoco" (the fire).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha" agrees with the singular subject "il suo inglese". Additionally, it uses the past tense correctly to indicate that an improvement has already occurred.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La lezione ha continuato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular nouns require singular verbs and plural nouns require plural verbs. In this case, "lezione" is a feminine singular noun that requires the use of the third person singular verb form "ha continuato."	La lezione ha continuato.
0	The sentence "Saltare un ostacolo" is not grammatically correct because it is missing a subject and the verb does not agree with an implied subject.	La frase è già corretta if the intended meaning is to express the action of jumping over an obstacle as a command or instruction, such as in sports training. In other contexts, the corrected sentence might be something like "Io salto un ostacolo" ("I jump over an obstacle") or "Egli sta saltando un ostacolo" ("He is jumping over an obstacle").
0	In this sentence, the verb "doesn't" is incorrect because it should agree with the subject "bambini," which is plural. The correct form of the verb to use would be "do not" or its contraction "don't". Additionally, "like" should replace "likes" as the former agrees with the plural noun "bambini."	I bambini don't like spinaci.
0	La negazione si forma utilizzando il doppio negativo ("don't" + "no") in questa frase, ma ciò produce un'espressione linguistica confusa e poco chiara. È preferibile evitare i doppi negativi e usarne solo uno alla volta per rendere le affermazioni più precise ed efficaci.	I don't have any money.
0	The correct form of the verb should be "macchia" instead of "macchia" because "il vino" is singular and masculine.	La macchia il vino.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense "era" to indicate that something happened in the past and uses the plural form of the verb "gelare" which agrees with the subject "l'acqua".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Le tappe hanno bruciato per un'ora" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, "hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere", which agrees with the subject "le tappe". Additionally, "bruciare" is correctly used as a transitive verb here, taking "per un'ora" as its duration complement.	La frase è già corretta.
1	La parola "cristallo" può prendere il verbo alla terza persona singolare, poiché ci riferiamo ad una sola entità ("il cristallo"). In questa frase viene usato il verbo "spezzarsi", coniugato al presente indicativo nella sua forma appropriata per la terza persona singolare ("si spezza"). Pertanto, la frase è grammaticalmente corretta dal punto di vista dell'accordo tra soggetto e verbo.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ha verificato l'autenticità della firma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a simple past tense verb form ("ha verificato") and its direct object ("l'autenticità della firma").	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Paola ha visto la partita con gli amici." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing past actions in Italian using the auxiliary verb "avere" and the past participle of the main verb. In this case, the subject "Paola" performs the action of seeing "la partita," which agrees with the gender and number of the object being referred to. Additionally, "con gli amici" correctly indicates that she watched the match together with her friends. Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: La frase "Paola ha visto la partita con gli amici." è grammaticalmente corretta poiché segue la struttura standard per esprimere azioni passate in italiano usando il verbo ausiliario "avere" ed il participio passato del verbo principale. Nel caso specifico, il soggetto "Paola" svolge l'azione di vedere "la partita", che concorda con genere e numero dell'oggetto cui si fa riferimento. Inoltre, "con gli amici" indica correttamente che lei ha guardato la partita insieme agli amici.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Gabriele si è tagliato le basette" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "si è" is the third person singular reflexive verb that agrees with the subject "Gabriele," while "le basette" refers to the object being cut by the subject.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The sentence "Riccardo si è tagliato il mento con il rasoio" follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in Italian. It also correctly uses the past tense to describe an action that has already happened.
1	Both "si è calmato" and "irrigidito" are grammatically correct ways to indicate that Francesco has calmed down and stiffened. In Italian, the reflexive pronoun "si" is used with the verb "essere" (to be) when there is no direct object involved. The sentence correctly uses the singular past tense form of "essere," which agrees with the subject "Francesco."	La frase è già corretta.
1	La frase è gramaticalmente corretta perché utilizza i pronomi e verbi appropriati nella forma corretta. In particolare, "li" è usato come pronome oggetto per riferirsi alle persone precedentemente menzionate al maschile plural ("ho visto"), mentre "hanno" si accorda con esso.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verbs "mangiate" and "bevete" should agree with the subject "voi". Also, there should be a comma after "festa".	Venite alla festa, mangiaté e beveté.
1	The sentence "Il dibattito è continuato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular nouns require the use of the third person singular form of the verb to be (in this case, "é"). Here, "dibattito" is a singular noun and requires the use of "é".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il dibattito ha continuato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian verbs. In this case, "dibattito," which is masculine singular, agrees with its verb "ha continuato," also being third person singular.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha cancellato la scritta." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and a verb in past tense ("ha cancellato").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Leonardo suona il telefono" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of Italian language.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the first person singular verb form should be used instead of the first person plural. The correct conjugation for the auxiliary verb "to go" in the past tense is "andai".	Io andai alla riunione. (Note that I am assuming the intended meaning was to express that you went to the meeting alone; if not, please let me know.)
0	The correct form of the verb should agree with the subject. In this case, "you" is the subject and it requires the second person singular form of the verb, which is "hai". However, the pronoun "li" refers to plural objects, so there needs to be a plural object after the verb. A possible correction could be "Hai visti quei ragazzi ieri?" or "I ragazzi, li hai visti ieri?"	Hai visti quei ragazzi ieri? (Have you seen those boys yesterday?) OR I ragazzi, li hai visti ieri? (The boys, have you seen them yesterday?)
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, "li" is plural but it refers to people who are grammatically masculine, so we need to use a singular form of the third person of the present tense that agrees in gender with them ("gusta", not "piacciono"). Also, there is no need for a pronoun before the verb because it has been already used at the beginning of the sentence.	A loro piace giocare a calcio. OR Piace a loro giocare a calcio.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The use of the past tense "si è bruciato" indicates that the forest was burning for three hours, which is grammatically correct.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "doesn't" must agree with the subject "bambini," which is plural. Therefore, we need to use "don't" instead of "doesn't". Also, there should be an apostrophe after "children" if it indicates possession, but since that does not seem to be the case here, no apostrophe is necessary.	I bambini don't like spinach.
0	La domanda dovrebbe essere formulata come "Hai visto i gatti?" anziché "Li hai visti i gatti?", poiché il pronome oggetto "li" non è necessario qui.	Hai visto i gatti? Spiegazione completa: Quando si utilizza una forma verbale con soggetti plurali, può essere inclusa anche la particella pronominale ("li", "le", "ne") per indicare il complemento oggetto diretto del verbo. Tuttavia, quando la domanda viene posta usando questa struttura, sembra ridondante ed erroneamente costruita. Di conseguenza, sarebbe meglio evitarla nel linguaggio quotidiano.
1	The sentence "Si è rotta la televisione in un'ora" is grammatically correct because it uses the reflexive verb si è rotto correctly to indicate that something broke on its own and also specifies when it happened with "in un'ora."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the subject-verb agreement rule where "si" agrees with its plural subject "la sala." Moreover, it uses the past tense form "svuotata," which indicates that the action of emptying has already been completed.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be for third person singular should be used instead of first person plural.	Il treno si è un po' fermato. (The train has stopped for a bit.)
1	Questa frase è grammaticalmente corretta perché il verbo "ho visto" concorda con il soggetto "io", mentre il verbo all'infinito "giocare" viene usato dopo "avere visto". Inoltre, i pronomi oggetto "li" si riferiscono ai giocatori che sono stati osservati.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable with proper use of the past tense "ho notato" to indicate that the action was completed in the past.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence, which agrees with the verb "conosce". The singular form of the third person present tense of the verb "conoscere" ("to know") is used correctly here.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "approfittare" requires the preposition "di", so it should be "Andrea approfitta di Maria". Also, "approfitta" generally means to take advantage of something or someone, which might not convey the intended meaning here. If you meant to say that Andrea is enjoying himself with Maria, then consider using "si gode" instead, like this: "Andrea si gode Maria."	Andrea approfitta di Maria. OR Andrea si gode Maria.
0	The sentence is missing the subject of the question. It should be "Chi **egli** ama?" or "Who does he love?" if translated to English.	Chi egli ama?
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the plural form of the verb to agree with the plural subject "loro".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses the appropriate form of the verb "pesare" to agree with the subject "trenta chili."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Mio nonno ha venduto il suo podere" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses the correct tense.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the plural form "sono" which agrees with its subject "due lingue".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Otto ore al giorno sono studiate da Tommaso" is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "otto ore al giorno" agrees with the singular verb "sono". This is because "ore" is an plural noun but it functions as a collective unit when used with a specific quantity and time frame.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Trivellare" is the correct infinitive form of the verb that means to drill or bore. In this case, it is used correctly with the subject "Alessandro".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso torna da Roma" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb must agree with the number and gender of its subject. In this case, the singular masculine subject "Tommaso" corresponds to the third person singular form of the verb "tornare," which is "torna."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Francesco macina il caffè in un vecchio macinino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all of the words are used correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso rubò il portafoglio a Maria in un autobus" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the past tense. In this case, "rubò" is the correct form of the verb "rubare" to indicate that Tommaso committed the action in the past. Additionally, all nouns and articles are correctly gendered and numbered.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the right form of the past tense ("mise") and correctly indicates where Riccardo put the box ("nel mobile").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Lo scoglio affiora" can be translated to "The reef emerges" or "The rock protrudes" in English. It means that the top of the underwater structure becomes visible above the water surface.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea si comporta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb conjugates according to the number and gender of the subject. In this case, "Andrea" is singular and masculine, so "si comporta", which is also singular and third person masculine, agrees with the subject.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Leonardo sottrae la penna" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Leonardo") and a verb ("sottrae") conjugated correctly based on the subject, followed by the direct object ("la penna"). In this case, "sottrae" means "to subtract," but when used metaphorically or figuratively, as might be the case here, it can mean something like "takes away" or "steals."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo toglie dalla cassaforte il giornale." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo") and a verb ("toglie") that agrees with the subject in number and gender, followed by the object ("il giornale").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro legge un libro a letto" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper singular agreement between the subject and verb.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo beve il the in una tazzina di porcellana" is grammatically correct because it follows all of Italian's rules for word order and verb conjugation. In this sentence, "Riccardo" is the subject, "beve" is the present tense third person singular form of the verb "bere," which means to drink, "il the" is the direct object, and "in una tazzina di porcellana" describes where the action takes place.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Dov'è che Andrea ha preso una sigaretta?" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the question word "dove" and includes the appropriate tense of the verb "prendere".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso estrasse la pistola nel bar." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, "estrarre" is the verb meaning to draw or extract, which is used here in its past tense form ("estrasse") that agrees with the subject "Tommaso". Additionally, all words are correctly gendered and numbered according to their intended meanings. Therefore, no corrections need to be made, and I can confirm that:	La frase è già corretta.
0	The subject "Riccardo" requires the use of the third person singular verb form "mange" instead of the first or second person plural "mangiamo". Also, there is no need for an object pronoun since one is already present in the sentence ("il riso").	Riccardo mangia il riso.
0	The verb "sostiene" should agree with its subject "Tommaso". It should be "sostiene" instead of "vi sustiene". Also, the indirect object pronoun "la" is unnecessary and incorrect here.	Tommaso ti sostiene. (If the intended meaning was that Tommaso supports you.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Leonardo prende il libro dalla sala della biblioteca. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Gabriele mette le casse sul ripiano del montacarichi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Gabriele") and a verb ("mette") that agrees in number and person with the subject, as well as a direct object ("le casse") and a prepositional phrase ("del montacarichi").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for the given subject.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso toglie i soldi dal cassetto." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular masculine verbs in the present tense ("toglie" is the correct form of the verb "togliere").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La chiave sta nella toppa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of Italian sentences.	La chiave sta nella toppa.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Dal giardino alla strada Lorenzo vi ha piantato i fiori. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il giardino" agrees with the singular verb form "ha piantato". Also, the preposition "al" correctly indicates movement towards a destination ("garage").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Edoardo carica le casse sulla nave" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Edoardo") and a verb ("carica") that agrees in number and person with the subject, followed by the object ("le casse") and the destination or location ("sulla nave").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Poggiare" is a transitive verb that requires an object to complete its meaning, which is why the preposition "contro" is used before the noun phrase "il muro." This construction allows for a clear understanding of what or who is being supported by the scale.	La bilancia poggia contro il muro. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Incarcerare" is the verb meaning "to imprison", which agrees with its direct object "Gabriele". Moreover, the preposition "in" followed by "le segrete" correctly indicates where Gabriele was imprisoned.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Francesco chiuse Giulia nella stanza" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order rules of Italian language.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "chiudere" should match the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is "Gabriele", which is singular and third-person, so the correct form of the verb would be "chiude".	Gabriele chiuse il denaro. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Gabriele diede appoggio al libro" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows the rules of Italian syntax.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro dette appoggio alla diffusione del libro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and all the words are correctly conjugated according to their respective genders and numbers.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject of the sentence, and "caricò" is the corresponding past tense verb that agrees with the masculine singular subject.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "deterge" agrees with its subject "latte" and it uses the third person singular form "-e". Also, the preposition "dal" correctly indicates the direction of the action from the milk to the impurities on the face.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo stipò l'armadio con i vestiti." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the verb "stipò" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Riccardo," and all the words are arranged correctly to convey the intended meaning.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Mi piace leggere libri interessanti" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence in Italian with a subject ("Io"), a verb ("piacere") and an object ("libri interessanti"). Also, the use of "mi" as indirect object pronoun before the conjugated verb indicates that the action is performed to or for the speaker, which is also grammatically correct.	Mi piace leggere libri interessanti.
0	The sentence contains the incorrect use of the reflexive pronouns "si" and "la". It should be "Si allontanarono l'uno dall'altro." instead of "l'una all'altra", since both Riccardo and Paola are moving away from each other. Also, when using the third person plural form ("loro"), it is not necessary to include a specific subject beforehand; therefore, simply writing "allontanarono" would suffice.	Riccardo e Paola si allontanarono l'uno dall'altro.
1	The sentence "Francesco avvolge la statua in una tela di lino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro accompagna Sofia al cinema" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and verb conjugations.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea accompanied Paola to school." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in English.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be for "libro" is "il libro", which requires the third person singular form "sta". Also, it should be "gli alberi" instead of "l'albero" because "gli" is used when referring to masculine plural nouns that begin with a vowel or a stressed "h."	Il libro non sta sugli alberi.
1	The sentence "Andrea attraversò la parte meno pericolosa del fiume." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all of the words are correctly conjugated for the tense used.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be more clear and natural to say "I intend to dress as a bride."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Francesco mangiava il pane con soddisfazione." is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian because it follows the standard structure for past tense verbs and includes appropriate conjugations and word usage.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The phrase is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It uses the past tense form of "piovere" which is "piovve", followed by the adverb "a dirotto". This construction describes that it rained very heavily during that morning.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb should match with the subject. In this case, "il vino" is singular and masculine, so we need to use the third person singular form of the verb "bere". A better way to write it would be: "Il vino beve Alessandro." However, even though the sentence uses the grammatically correct form, logically speaking, it still doesn't make sense because wine can't drink someone else! So maybe you meant something like: "Alessandro beve il vino"? I will assume that was your intended meaning for the purpose of this exercise.	Alessandro beve il vino.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha telefonato e Maria è venuta" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere" which agrees with the subject "Maria".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the past tense of "dare" (to give) which requires two objects, one direct object ("il libro") and one indirect object ("Paola"). In this case, it is also specified who gave the book to Paola with the phrase "da Gabriele".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea mangia un polpo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Andrea") and a verb ("mangia", which agrees with the singular subject "Andrea") and the direct object ("un polpo").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "mangia", and the direct object "questo" is correctly placed after the verb.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "have" must agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is "I", which requires the singular form of the verb "have". Additionally, there should not be an apostrophe after "two" because it indicates possession rather than plurality in this context.	I don't have three brothers; I have only two brothers.
0	The verb "ha" should agree with the subject "l'artrite," so it should be "l'artrite ha paralizzato." Also, there is no such thing as bones being paralyzed; rather, joints can become stiff or immobile due to arthritis.	L'artrite ha reso le articolazioni rigide.
0	The verb "mangiare" should agree with the subject "Maria", so it should be "Maria vuole mangiarlo."	Maria vuole mangiarlo.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ammira Alice." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo") and a verb ("ammira", which agrees in number and gender with the subject) followed by the object ("Alice"). In this case, all elements are used correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In questa frase ci sono due errori riguardanti il pronome oggetto "li" e il verbo "ho visto". Prima di tutto, quando si usa "vedere" con un complemento oggetto diretto, come nella frase sopra, il verbo deve concordare con il soggetto ("ragazzi") piuttosto che con il pronome oggetto ("li"). Secondariamente, il pronome oggetto dovrebbe apparire prima del verbo ausiliario "avere", pertanto la frase avrebbe dovuto essere formulata così: "I ragazzi, li ho visti giocare nel parco."	I ragazzi, li ho visti giocare nel parco.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It consists of the subject "Edoardo" followed by the verb "mira" in its third person singular form, indicating that the subject is performing an action on something else. In this case, that object is implied but not explicitly stated - it could be "the presidency," or another goal.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "salta" and the word order is also correct.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word "subito" which means "immediately". It should not be used at the beginning of the sentence like that. Also, there should be a comma after "Edoardo".	È Edoardo che subito vuole il caffè. Confidence level: I am quite confident about this answer as it follows standard Italian grammar rules and usage of the word "subito."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the right form of the verb "tenere" to agree with the subject "Tommaso." The word order and overall structure are also correct.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. Although it would be more common to say "Leonardo wants to become president," the sentence as written is still acceptable Italian.	The sentence is already correct.
0	La parola "me" dovrebbe essere scritta come "mi". Inoltre, sarebbe più appropriato utilizzare l'articolo determinativo "il" prima della parola "museo", poiché si sta facendo riferimento a un museo specifico.	Io vado al museo con i miei amici.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("il cinema") and a verb ("adora"). Also, "Francesco" is correctly used as the subject complement to specify which cinema Francesco adores.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "E" is used to connect two nouns when both are masculine or feminine and have the same form of article. In this case, both "il cinema" and "la musica" are correctly connected with "e".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "I denti di Emma batto/battono dal freddo" is grammatically correct because both forms of the verb "battere" are acceptable in this context. However, "battono" is more commonly used to indicate that all of Emma's teeth are chattering due to the cold. On the other hand, "batto" would imply that only one tooth is making a noise, which is less likely in this context. Nonetheless, since the singular form can still be found in some dialects or informal settings, it will not affect the overall understanding and communication of the message. Therefore, we consider this sentence as grammatically correct with either option.	Both "I denti di Emma battono dal freddo" and "I denti di Emma batte dal freddo" are considered correct sentences.
0	There should be an agreement between the subject and verb. In this case, "lead" should agree with "Alessandro", so it should be "leads". Also, there is no need for "that have" because we can directly say "long legs". The word "donne" at the end of the sentence seems out of place as well.	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Alessandro le adora perché ha delle lunghe gambe." oppure "Alessandro le adora perché lei ha lunghe gambe.", a seconda del contesto desiderato.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "adora" agrees with its subject "Andrea", which is singular and in third person. Also, the preposition "di" is used correctly to indicate possession.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mangia un gelato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object order and uses proper singular verb agreement with the subject "Gabriele."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo promises to Riccardo that he will come" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a clause with a subject ("Riccardo"), a verb ("promises") and an object ("to Riccardo"). Additionally, the pronoun "he" correctly refers back to the nearest noun antecedent "Riccardo".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il polpo è divorato da Sofia" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "divorare" which agrees with its subject "il polpo". Also, the word order and use of prepositions are also appropriate.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Esulare" means to be outside the scope or limits of something, so it fits appropriately in this context.	La tolleranza ne esula dai suoi doveri. (The tolerance does not fall within its duties.)
1	The sentence "Riccardo ci viene da Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, we have a subject ("Riccardo") that performs an action ("venire"), which is expressed through the verb in its first-person plural present indicative form ("ci viene"). Moreover, there is also a location adverbial complement ("da Roma") indicating where the subject comes from. All these elements are correctly arranged to create a well-formed phrase with a clear meaning.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" matches with the verb form "pensa", and the object of the thought, "Paola", follows correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Sofia accompanies Maria to China" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct as it uses the appropriate past tense form "andarono" for two subjects.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ammira la casa che è di Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, we have a subject ("Alessandro") who performs an action ("ammira", which means "admiries"), followed by the object of his admiration ("la casa", meaning "the house"). Then there is the relative clause "che è di Paola," indicating possession; specifically that the house belongs to Paola. The verb form "è" agrees with its singular subject "casa." Additionally, all articles, nouns, and adjectives are correctly gendered and numbered according to their referents. Overall, this sentence demonstrates good command over standard Italian language usage.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "assorbire" requires the use of reflexive pronouns when followed by an object that refers to a specific person or thing. In this case, it should be "Beatrice lo inghiotte involontariamente".	La frase corretta sarebbe "Beatrice lo involontariamente assorbe".
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, "Lorenzo" is singular and third-person, so we need to use the third-person singular form of the verb "distribuire", which is "distribuisce". Using "distribuiscono" would be incorrect because it is the third-person plural form.	Lorenzo distribuisce il mattone.
1	The sentence "Che Riccardo dipinga è bello." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, "che" functions as a conjunction linking two clauses together; "Riccardo dipinga" is the subject of the second clause in the subjunctive mood, which indicates uncertainty or doubt about whether Riccardo actually paints; and "bello" serves as the predicate adjective agreeing with the singular masculine noun "Riccardo".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Sofia strolls through Venice." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Sofia") and a verb ("strolls"). Moreover, the verb tense used is appropriate for describing ongoing or habitual action.	La frase è già corretta.
0	Nella prima frase, il verbo "raccogliere" deve concordare con il soggetto "Maria", quindi si usa la terza persona singolare "raccolge". Invece viene utilizzata la prima persona plurale "racogliamo". Questo errore rende la frase grammaticalmente incorretta.	Maria raccoglie sassolini. La frase precedente è già corretta.
0	In Italian, when you are stating that someone is doing an action to a specific object, you need to include the article ("il" or "lo" for masculine singular objects and "la" or "l'" for feminine singular objects) before the noun. Therefore, the correct form of this sentence would be "Lei legge il libro".	La frase corretta è: "Lei legge il libro".
1	The sentence "Beatrice schermisce con abilità" is grammatically correct because it uses the third person singular form of the verb ("schermisce") to agree with the subject "Beatrice". Additionally, the preposition "con" followed by the noun "abilità" correctly indicates how Beatrice performs fencing.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "Maria", so it should be "Maria travels" instead of "traveste". Also, there is no need for an object "Alice" because the sentence implies that Maria is dressing up as someone else, not physically changing another person named Alice.	Maria travels as Alice.
1	The sentence "Emma umilia Edoardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where singular subjects take singular verbs and plural subjects take plural verbs. In this case, "Emma" is a singular female name and therefore takes the third person singular form of the verb "umiliare," which is "umilia."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il fulmine cadde sulla testa di Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, the subject "il fulmine" comes before the verb "cadde," which is conjugated correctly to match the third-person singular masculine gender of the subject. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "sulla testa di Andrea" provides more information about where exactly the lightning struck.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Fa neve" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for forming sentences in Italian: subject + verb + object. In this case, there isn't an explicit subject or object, but the subject can be implied as being "it," referring to the weather. The verb "fa" means "makes" or "does," and here it is used with the noun "neve," which means "snow." So, the complete translation would be "It snows."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro dormicchia nell'inazione più totale" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La maionese non ha preso bene" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar and syntax. In this sentence, "la maionese" is the subject and "non ha preso bene" is the predicate. The verb "ha preso" agrees with the singular feminine noun "maionese," and the negation "non" is placed before the verb as required by Italian grammar.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the name is "Giulia", not "Giuliass". Also, there should be no apostrophe after "Giulia" because it is not a possessive form.	Maria saluta a Giulia. (The sentence would be grammatically correct if it was just "Maria saluta a Giulia.")
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ad" is correctly used as a preposition here to indicate movement or direction towards something or someone. It agrees with the following noun "Alice."	Il vestito non va ad Alice.
1	The sentence "Il capitale dell'azienda ammonta a molti miliardi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, "il capitale" is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "ammonta". Additionally, "di dell'azienda" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the subject. Lastly, "molti miliardi" is an adverbial expression of quantity. All these elements are combined correctly to express a complex idea.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Una stella splende nel cielo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("una stella"), verb ("splende") and object ("nel cielo"). The word order is also correct and there are no apparent errors in tense or agreement between words. Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: The sentence is already correct.	Una stella splende nel cielo.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	A star shines in the sky. (Note: I am assuming that this input was meant to be "A star shines in the sky," since it is written in English instead of Italian as requested.)
1	The sentence "Una stella scintilla nel cielo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. The subject of the sentence is "una stella," which is correctly conjugated with the third person singular present tense verb form "scintilla." This means that the star twinkles or sparkles in the sky. The prepositional phrase "nel cielo" adds more information about where this action takes place. Overall, the sentence conveys a clear and complete idea using proper grammar and punctuation.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The phrase "Il vestito di Maria scintilla di uno stupendo diamante" follows the rules of subject-verb agreement, word order, and article usage in Italian. It means "Mary's dress sparkles with a stunning diamond."
1	The sentence "Beatrice arde dalla passione" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Beatrice") and a verb ("arde") that agrees in number and tense.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Paola luccicava dall'emozione. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ti ritorna" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate form of the verb "ritornare" to agree with the informal singular pronoun "ti". This phrase means "Gabriele returns to you", and both subject and indirect object are correctly expressed.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo giunge in casa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third-person singular present tense verbs ("giunge" matches with masculine singular subject "Riccardo").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La scala scende in cantina" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, "scenda" agrees with its subject "la scala", which is feminine singular, and expresses movement toward an interior location ("in"). Additionally, the preposition "in" correctly indicates motion into or inside something. Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: The sentence is already correct.	La scala scende in cantina.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il sentiero" agrees with the verb "arriva" in number and person.	La frase è già corretta. Confidence: 95%
0	In the sentence "La Maggioranza patteggia con l'Opposition," there is an incorrect word that should be changed to its Italian equivalent for proper understanding. The term "patteggia" is of Italian origin but it needs to be replaced with its correct translation in English which is "negotiate". Additionally, since both "Maggioranza" and "Opposition" are plural nouns, they require an article before them. So, the corrected sentence would read as follows:	The Majority negotiates with the Opposition.

1	The sentence "Riccardo taglia il pane a fette." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order.

1	The sentence "Paola gli carezzò il volto." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "gli" is a pronoun that replaces the indirect object "Paola," while "carezzò" is the third person singular past tense form of the verb "carezzare."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it could be improved for clarity and simplicity. "Nutri" means to feed or nourish, while "alimentò" means he fed something on a regular basis in the past. However, using "alimentò" instead of "nutrì" would make the meaning clearer that this was not just a one-time occurrence. Also, "di tutti" can be omitted since it is already implied by context.	La frase è già corretta, but an alternative clearer version could be: "Gabriele alimentò nel figlio l'idea di essere il migliore e il più intelligente."
1	The sentence "Riccardo liberó el perro delle catene" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate conjugations for each verb according to their corresponding subjects.	La frase è già corretta.

In this sentence, "Alessandro" is the subject, "prese" is the past tense of the verb "prendere," "il cappotto" is the direct object, and "dall'armadio" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial phrase indicating where the action took place.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Riccardo affoga i dispiaceri nel vino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and a verb ("affoga") conjugated correctly to match its subject. In this case, the third person singular form of the verb "affogare" is used which matches the masculine gender and singular number of the subject "Riccardo." Additionally, the preposition "nel" is followed by the article "il," indicating that the noun "vino" is masculine singular. All these elements make for a grammatically correct sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the subject-verb agreement rule, where "un buon timoniere" which is singular agrees with "attracca", also singular. Moreover, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Tommaso pompava l'acqua dal lago alla piscina" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, "pompava" is the imperfect tense of the verb "pompare," which means "to pump." This form is used to indicate that an action was ongoing or repeated in the past. Additionally, "l'acqua" agrees with its plural subject "Tommaso" in gender but not number, as it is the singular, feminine definite article ("the") referring to water in general. Overall, the sentence describes a specific event involving Tommaso and his action of pumping water from the lake into the pool.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro e Leonardo negoziano la libertà di Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, both names are masculine singular nouns ("Alessandro" and "Leonardo"), so the plural form of the third person present tense of the verb "negoziare" must be used, which is indeed "negoziano". Additionally, the direct object "la libertà", being feminine singular, agrees with its definite article "la". Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable as it stands.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the compound past tense ("aveva separato") which requires the auxiliary verb "avere" to be conjugated in the imperfect form ("aveva"). This matches with the subject of the sentence being a woman in the feminine singular form ("una donna"), as it should since there is only one subject. Additionally, the names "Andrea" and "Tommaso", if they refer to males, need to use masculine nouns after them when describing an action performed on those subjects. In this case, we have two male subjects separated by a woman.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo allontana Maria dalla stanza" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular subjects ("Riccardo") and direct objects ("Maria").	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Riccardo le sostituisce il tubo catodico" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and verb agreement. In this sentence, "Riccardo" is the subject, "le" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to someone who has already been mentioned, "sostituisce" is the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "substitute," and "il tubo catodico" is the direct object. Therefore, the translation into English would be: "Riccardo replaces the cathode ray tube for her." The given sentence is already correct, so I will write:	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso alterna Beatrice con Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an Italian sentence and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects and objects.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "L'amore lega" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate form of the verb "legare" that agrees with its subject "l'amore."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "dolere" requires the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere", which is "esso". Also, the subject "I due" should be replaced by "loro due". Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Loro due hanno mal di testa."	Loro due hanno male alla testa. Input: Io vado all'universita ogni giorni. Label: 0 Explanation: In Italian, we use the plural form "giorni" instead of the singular form "gorno" when referring to more than one day. So, the correct sentence would be "Io vado all'università ogni giorno." Io vado all'università ogni giorno.
0	In questa frase dovrebbe esserci la forma singolare "mi piace" al posto della forma plurale "mi piacerebbero", poiché si sta ordinando solo una bevanda alla volta.	Mi piace un caffè, per favore. Oppure, nel caso in cui vogliate davvero due caffè, potete dire: Vorrei due caffè, per favore.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Desiderare" can be used both as a transitive verb (when followed by a direct object) or an impersonal verb (without a specific subject). In this case, it is being used impersonally to express that Maria desires something in general, without specifying what she desires.	Maria desidera il fatto che tu venga.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Giulia" is the subject of the sentence, followed by the verb "abbandona" conjugated in the third person singular form to agree with the subject. Then there is the subordinate clause "che vedrà", where "vedrà" is also conjugated correctly in the third person singular form to match its subject "Edoardo". Therefore, I would say that the syntax and agreement between words are consistent with the rules of standard Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In Italiano, il verbo "essere" concordato con il soggetto. Nel caso del singolare femminile, si usa "sono". Pertanto, la forma corretta per questa frase sarebbe "Sono una donna alta."	Sono una donna alta.
1	The sentence "Maria si assicura che tutto funziona alla perfezione" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, we have the subject "Maria", followed by the verb "si assicura" conjugated in third person singular present tense, and the direct object "che tutto funziona alla perfezione". This structure respects the word order of an Italian declarative sentence, which typically has the subject before the verb. Moreover, the form of the verb agrees with the number and gender of the subject, as required by Italian grammar. Therefore, I can conclude that the given sentence is grammatically acceptable.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "approva" and the subordinate clause "Maria parta" follows the rules of Italian conjugation.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be for third person singular should be used after "Alice". It should be "partes" instead of "parte".	Emma doubts that Alice parts.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Che" does not make sense and there seems to be missing words or context for it to be understood correctly. Also, the verb form should agree with the number of subjects, so "viaggia" would be more appropriate if "Lorenzo" were the only subject. However, without proper context, it's difficult to determine what exactly the intended meaning of this sentence might be.	La prospettiva che Lorenzo viaggi angoscia Tommaso. (The idea that Lorenzo is traveling annoys Tommaso.)
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there are two verbs "approva" and "ciò" that don't agree with the subject "Riccardo". Also, it is missing an article before "idea".	Riccardo approva quella idea. (or Riccardo approves that idea.)
0	The verb "approvare" should agree with the subject "Edoardo". In this case, it needs to be "approva", not "approval". Also, there is an extra space before "il fatto".	Edoardo approva il fatto che Maria canta.
0	The correct verb form to use after "tu" should be "desideri", not "desidera". Also, the word order needs to be changed slightly for the sentence to make sense in Italian. It should be "Desideri tu che Sofia venga?" or simply "Vuoi che Sofia venga?"	Vuoi che Sofia venga?
0	The verb "va" does not agree with the subject "Riccardo". It should be "Riccardo va alla sigaretta."	Riccardo va alla sigaretta. Confidence level: 95%
1	The sentence "Alice brama di tornare" is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the verb "bramare" which agrees with the subject "Alice." Additionally, the infinitive "tornare" follows the conjunction "di," and its use is appropriate for this context.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "incoraggiare" requires the indirect object pronoun "a" followed by an infinitive verb, not the conjugated form "si sposa". Also, there should be no "che" after "a". A correct version of this sentence would use the gerund "-ndo", which is "sposandosi" in this case.	Andrea encourage Maria a sposarsi.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il fatto" agrees with the singular verb "allegra". Also, the word "che" introduces a subordinate clause that modifies the noun "fatto", and it is correctly used.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "infiamma" needs to agree with its subject "andare al cinema," which is plural. A more appropriate verb would be "infiammano."	Andare al cinema **infiammano** Sofia.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Colpire" can be used to mean that something has an effect or impact on someone. In this case, the subject of the sentence finds it surprising that Riccardo is laughing.	La colpisce che Riccardo rida. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Mi meraviglia il fatto che Beatrice sia svestita" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "essere" for singular third person ("Beatrice" is a single female name and thus requires the use of "sia"). Also, the word order is correct as well as the tense (passato prossimo).	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to agree with "Leonardo" should be used. In this case, it is "allieta". Also, there should not be a repetition of "Leonardo". A pronoun can be used instead for clarity and proper sentence structure.	Leonardo allieta Maria perché lei ride.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It uses the proper form of verbs and adjective agreement with the subject "la tristezza" and "la noia".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Mi" is a reflexive pronoun that refers to the speaker, while "acquieta" means "calms down." This phrase indicates that it soothes the speaker when Giulia speaks in this way.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	The solitary presence of Alice calms me down. (Note: I made a slight change to the translation for clarity.)
1	The sentence "Parlare con le ballerine è divertente." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, we have the singular form of the third-person present tense of the verb "parlare" which agrees with its subject "tu," while "le ballerine" is in plural form to match the meaning conveyed by the speaker ("ballerine" as more than one dancer). Additionally, there is proper use of word order for expressing an action involving two or more parties.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate verb form "vengo" to match with the first person singular subject pronoun "Io". Also, the preposition "di" is correctly used before the direct object "poesia".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The phrase should use the past tense of the verb "vedere" which is "videro", not the infinitive form. Also, it requires a subject for the sentence.	Paola vide i marziani accadere. (Paola saw the aliens appear.)
0	The sentence "Aver vinto al lotto splendeva nel suo sguardo" is grammatically incorrect because it uses the past participle form of the verb ("aver vinto") without an auxiliary verb to form a complete tense. Also, "sguardo" should be plural since there are two subjects ("lei" and "lotto").	La vincita al lotto faceva brillare i suoi occhi.
0	The sentence is missing the subject. It should be clear who or what "has" and "splendeva".	La sua gioia per aver vinto al lotto splendeva nei suoi occhi.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject. In this case it should be "Si tratta **di** qualcosa **che** dobbiamo fare" or simply "Dobbiamo fuggire".	Dobbiamo fuggire.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Si" can be used as an impersonal pronoun that refers to people in general or it can also function as a reflexive pronoun when the subject of the verb is understood from context. In this case, since there is no other explicit subject, "si" serves as the subject and agrees with the third person singular form of the verb "trattare", which is "tratta". Therefore, "Si tratta di fuggire." means "It is about escaping."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The use of the present tense "denota" is grammatically correct to indicate a current state or situation.	Il fatto che Emma sia uscita così presto denota che in questo momento non sta andando d'accordo con te. Note: While "va" can be used informally, I am providing a more formal version with "sta andando".
1	The use of the past tense "condannavo" would be more appropriate than the past perfect "ero condannato." In English, this distinction is made between simple past and present perfect. However, Italian uses two separate verb forms to make this distinction as well.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Gabriele adora carezzare Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the third person singular verb form "adora" agrees with its singular subject "Gabriele," and the direct object pronoun "la" is correctly placed before the infinitive verb "carezzare."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea intends to marry Alice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Andrea"), intent verb ("intends") and object ("to marry Alice").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo evita guardare la televisione" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, "Riccado," which is the subject, agrees with the verb "evita," both being conjugated correctly for the third person singular masculine form. Moreover, "guardare" is an infinitive that functions as the direct object of the sentence, while "la televisione" is the indirect object.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "si parte" should agree with the subject "Paola", so it needs to be changed to "parte". Also, there is an extra "è" that does not belong in the sentence.	Paola thinks that partire è carino.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo riteneva Alice fosse Paola" is grammatically correct because it uses the Italian conjugated verb "riteneva" which agrees with its subject "Lorenzo", and it correctly employs the subjunctive mood with "fosse".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "giudicare" requires the use of the indicative mood ("Beatrice lo giudica che Maria ha troppi amanti") instead of the subjunctive mood ("Beatrice lo giudichi che Maria abbia troppi amanti"). In addition, there should be an article before "troppi amanti".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Beatrice lo giudica che Maria ha troppe amanti."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it could be improved for clarity and simplicity. "Sofia lo giudica per il fatto che Maria ha troppe amante." would have the same meaning with fewer words. However, I will evaluate the given sentence since it does not contain any grammar mistakes.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rules for compound subjects ("lo" refers to "Maria", which is feminine singular, so the verb should be conjugated as third person singular feminine in the past tense, i.e., "giudicava").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the appropriate use of subjunctive mood ("beba") after "supporre" and the subject pronouns are correctly used.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to think is "penso" and not "pensoo". Also, there should be an object after the verb. For example, "Io penso a te."	Io penso a te. (I think about you.)
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the missing subject and verb agreement. It should be "Io **penso** che tu ami il tartufo." instead of just **"di te, penso"**. Also, it is more common to say "Mi piace il tartufo" rather than saying "Amo il tartufo". But I will only focus on the grammar issue here.	Io penso che tu ami il tartufo.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Emma obtains something from you. (The sentence is already correct.)
0	The verb "lavora" does not agree with the subject "Alice e Maria". It should be "lavorano" since there are two subjects. Also, it is not clear what "cacciare" means in this context. If you want to say that Alice works next to Maria or near her, then use "accanto a".	Alice lavora accanto a Maria.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria ci ispira" is grammatically correct because it uses the right verb form ("ispirare") to agree with its subject ("Maria"). Also, the pronoun "ci" is correctly used as an indirect object pronoun indicating that Maria inspires us or has some kind of influence on us.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria ci si aggrappa" is grammatically correct because it follows the proper structure for reflexive verbs in Italian. In this case, "si" serves as both a direct and indirect object pronoun referring to "Maria," while "aggrappa" is the third-person singular form of the verb "agganciarsi."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Mira" is the third person singular form of the verb "mirare," which means "to aim." Therefore, it agrees with the subject "Paola." Additionally, "il futuro" refers to the concept of the future as an abstract noun, so there is no need for an article before it.	Paola mira a che il futuro sia felice.
1	The sentence "Giulia guardava il muro." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for past tense ("guardava" is the imperfect form of the verb "guardare", which agrees with the subject "Giulia").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it could be improved for clarity by adding a missing pronoun before the verb "pensa". In this case, I assume that the subject of the second part of the sentence should be "Tommaso" and not "Riccardo", as implied by the use of "lo" referring to a previous masculine singular noun or pronoun. However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine with absolute certainty who is doing the thinking.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it could be hard to understand without additional context. It seems like there might be missing information about who or what is doing the action of tying.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "sorridere" should be used with the preposition "di" only when followed by a noun or pronoun; if it is followed directly by an infinitive phrase as in this case ("del fatto"), then the correct form of the verb to use is "sorreggere".	Alice sorregge il fatto di aver pianto.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "il nostro". In this case it is necessary to use the third person singular "parte" instead of first person plural "partiamo".	Da tale analisi risulta il nostro partire. (If we were to start from the analysis.) or Da questa analisi risulta che noi partiamo. (This analysis shows that we leave.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "dipendere" agrees with its subject "la tosse", and the clause "di aver fumato troppo" provides additional information about the cause of the cough.	La tosse dipende dal fatto di aver fumato troppo. (The sentence is already correct.)
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "Leonardo". Therefore, it should be "Leonardo **è**" instead of "Leonardo **chiarisce che non è**".	Leonardo chiarisce che non è colpa sua. (The phrase "Paola." is unnecessary because there is no clear antecedent.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" matches with the verb "fischia" and the pronoun "che" refers to "Maria". Also, there are no missing punctuation marks or misspelled words.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Accennare" means to hint or allude to something. In this context, it implies that Andrea will give some indication about whether or not Edoardo will leave.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Addebitare" is a transitive verb that requires an object to complete its meaning, which is provided by the phrase "il fatto che ora ha fame." This construction is called a subordinate clause, which functions as the direct object of the sentence. It indicates the reason for Paola making Leonardo responsible for something.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, followed by the reflexive verb "lo aggiunge", which means "he adds it". The pronoun "it" refers to something previously mentioned or understood from context.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct with the verb "ha" agreeing with the subject "Maria".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "il fatto" agrees with the plural verb "sono". Also, there are no missing punctuation marks or misspelled words.	The journalists attack in newspapers the fact that many politicians are corrupt. (Note: I added the word "in" to indicate where the journalists are attacking, but other than that, the original sentence was already grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Incoraggiare" is used correctly as a verb meaning to encourage or promote, followed by the infinitive form of the verb "andare", which means to go. The subject "Paola" agrees with the verb conjugation, making this sentence grammatically sound.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ne" is used here as an indirect object pronoun to indicate that Emma informs or notifies something to Alessandro. It can be translated into English as "Emma lets Alessandro know."	Emma ne avvisa Alessandro.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo exempts Riccardo from the trip" is grammatically correct because it follows proper subject-verb agreement and uses correct tense.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Alice discusses leaving with Giulia. (The sentence was already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the impersonal verb "si" followed by the reflexive pronoun "si," which indicates that the subject performs an action on themselves. In this case, the action is "accorgersi," meaning to realize or notice. This structure is often used when referring to general truths or common experiences.	Maria si accorge di essere innamorata dal fatto di arrossire. (Maria realizes she is in love because of blushing.)
0	The verb "mangiare" does not agree with the subject "Edoardo". In this context, it should be conjugated as "mangia", since Edoardo is singular and masculine.	Edoardo continua a mangiare. (if you want to say that he continues eating something specific) or Edoardo continua a mangiare. (if you just want to say that he keeps on eating without specifying what)
0	The verb "indugiare" requires the use of the infinitive form after it, so "a mangiare" is needed instead of "lo indugia". Also, there should be an article before "bello".	Leonardo lo indugia a mangiare. It should be: Leonardo indugia a farlo mangiare.
1	The sentence "Edoardo osa mangiare" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb ("osa") agrees with its singular subject ("Edoardo").	La frase è già corretta.

0	The verb "suole" is not commonly used and it does not mean what the sentence seems to intend. A more appropriate word could be "mangia", meaning "eats". Also, there should be an article before "pasto".	Tommaso suol mangiare il pasto. OR Tommaso è solito mangiare il pranzo.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "deve mangiarlo" and the pronoun correctly refers to a masculine singular noun.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "usare" should be followed by the infinitive form of the second verb, which is "mangiare", not the bare stem "-lo". Also, there shouldn't be a space before the punctuation mark at the end of the sentence.	Gabriele usa mangiarlo. (should be "Gabriele usa mangiarlo." with no space before the period)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. Note: I have swapped the order of your original instructions to follow standard English language conventions for writing explanations before providing corrected sentences.
1	The sentence "Andrea salire in camera" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "salire" which agrees with the subject "Andrea". In present tense, the third person singular form must end in "-e", so this requirement is met by "salire".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo sparisce da Parigi." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, we have a proper noun ("Riccardo") as subject followed by a verb in third person singular present tense ("sparisce"). Moreover, there is an adverbial complement indicating where the action takes place ("da Parigi", literally from Paris). All these elements form a coherent structure that conveys meaning appropriately.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "La folla lo acclama mentre lui cammina" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. Here, "la folla" is a feminine plural noun that takes on the third person plural form of the present tense of the verb "acclamare," which is "acclaman." This agrees with the subject and object pronouns "lo" and "mentre lui cammina." Therefore, there are no errors or necessary corrections to be made.	La folla lo acclama mentre lui cammina.
1	The sentence "Tommaso invia Emma in piazza" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and all of its components are correctly used.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Beatrice" agrees with the verb "assembla", and the object of the sentence "un computer" follows the correct order.	La frase è già corretta.
1	La coniugazione del verbo qui utilizzata ("visto") è errata; si dovrebbe usare "ho visto" al posto di "io visto". Inoltre, manca anche l'articolo determinativo prima di "film", così come una virgola dopo "ieri".	Ho visto il film, ieri. Frase 2: "Il film è di Scorsese." Label: 1 Explanation: Questa frase è grammaticalmente corretta. L'uso dell'articolo determinativo "il" davanti a "film" è appropriato, e lo stesso vale per l'utilizzo del genitivo possessivo "di" prima di "Scorsese". La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Paola lavora." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the subject is "Paola" which requires the third person singular form of the verb "lavorare," which is "lavora."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for both "essere" (to be) and "angosciano" (they distress). Also, it correctly employs the definite article "quel" before referring to the specific painting of Picasso that causes Emma's friend distress.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Molte" means "many", which agrees with the plural subject "loro". Also, there is no need for an article before "leggono" because it has already been used at the beginning of the sentence ("le").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but can be improved for clarity and formality. "Alcuni" is not necessary because it is already implied by the plural verb "sono." Also, it would sound more formal to use "were designed" instead of "sono stati progettated".	Alcuni musei sono stati progettati dall'architetto. OR More formally: Alcuni musei furono progettati dall'architetto.
1	The sentence "Paola mangia la pizza." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Paola"), a verb in the third person singular present tense ("mangia") and the direct object ("la pizza").	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "ha" should agree with the subject "quell'architetto", so it needs to be changed to "ha" instead of "hanno".	Quell'architetto ha progettato alcuni musei.
0	In this sentence, the verb "hanno" does not agree with its subject "ragazze." The correct form of the verb should be "leggono". Also, there is an extra comma after "molte."	Hanno letto molte ragazze il giornale l'anno scorso. (if we assume that all girls read the newspaper together at the same time) or Meglio ancora: Molte ragazze hanno letto il giornale lo scorso anno.
1	The sentence "Le spalle di Riccardo toccano la parete" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for each subject.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the verb "tocca" is incorrect because it should agree with the subject "Maria," which is feminine singular. The correct form of the verb for third person singular present tense is "tocca". Also, there is a mistake with the definite article before the adjective "quel", it should be "quello" since it refers to a masculine singular noun.	Maria sta toccando quello film.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "che". In this case it should be "sia" instead of "sono". Also, there is missing agreement between gender and number for the adjective "partita", which should agree with "Beatrice". It should be "partita" if Beatrice is female singular.	Che tu sia partita **rallegr**i Beatrice.
0	In Italian, when using the verb "to be" (essere) with two or more subjects, you should use the third person singular form of the verb, which is "è", not the plural form "son". Therefore, the sentence "Lei e suo marito sono venuti al party" would be grammatically correct.	Lei e suo marito sono venuti al party.
1	The sentence "Beatrice is with Lorenzo" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb to be ("is") and correctly indicates that there is only one person performing the action (in this case, "being with").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Paola" is the subject of the sentence, followed by the auxiliary verb "ha meso" which agrees with the singular subject, then we have the direct object "la macchina", and finally the prepositional phrase "che è del frattelo" giving more information about the car.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "obbedisce" should agree with the subject "Tommaso". It should be "Tommaso obbedisce a Maria." instead of "Tommaso obbedisce di Maria."	Tommaso obbedisce a Maria.
0	The correct form should be "Andrea compares Leo**nard**o to Andrea" since the name is "Leonardo", not "Leonarco".	Andrea confronta Leonardo con Andrea. (if you want me to correct the original sentence) OR La frase è già corretta. (if I am evaluating the corrected version of the sentence provided by you)
1	Questa frase è grammaticalmente corretta perché contiene un soggetto ("Maria"), un verbo all'ausiliare passato ("ha fatto") ed il complemento oggetto ("la torta"). L'accordo tra il soggetto e il verbo ausiliare è corretto ed anche il genere del determinante possessivo con il nome complemento oggetto combacia correttamente al femminile singolare.	La frase è già corretta. Frase 2: "Sono felice che lei abbia fatto la torta." Label: 1 Explanation: Anche questa seconda frase è grammaticalmente corretta poiché include un pronome soggetto all'inizio dell'enunciato seguito dal verbo "essere" coniugato alla prima persona plurale; ciò riflette chiaramente i sentimenti positivi dei parlanti riguardo l'azione svolta dalla terza persona singolare espressa nel secondo enunciativo verbale. La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo è stato eccitato" is grammatically correct because it uses the right form of the past participle "eccitato", which agrees with the gender and number of the subject "Lorenzo". Also, the auxiliary verb "è stato" is used correctly to indicate that the action happened in the past.	La frase è già corretta.
1	La frase è grammaticalmente corretta perché utilizza forme corrette dei verbi "piacere" e "guardare", coniugate al presente indicativo. Inoltre, i pronomi personali sono usati correttamente ("mi" come pronome riflessivo e "lo" come pronome complemento diretto).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Tua" is the possessive adjective for "your" when referring to your sister specifically. In this case, it agrees with the gender of the noun it modifies, which is feminine ("sorella"). Also, "guarda" is the third person singular form of the verb "guardare", which matches the subject "tua sorella". Therefore, there are no errors in the given sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable because it uses the negative form "don't" with the singular subject "I", followed by the verb "have" to express the lack of something, which is three apples.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence there is an error related to the verb-subject agreement. The subject "Sofia" is singular and therefore requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "ha". However, it was used "hanno", which is the third person plural form. This creates an incorrect sentence because "hanno" does not match with the singular subject "Sofia".	Sophia ha tagliato le teste ai tori.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. It follows the subject-verb-object structure with proper use of prepositions and articles.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Il" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is "mio amico". In this case, it means "my friend", so there are no mistakes here.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable, even though it uses the present participle "ululando" instead of the indicative mood "ulula". However, using the present participle implies that the action is ongoing or being emphasized.	Riccardo ulula. (if we want to use the indicative mood instead)
1	The sentence "Gabriele dormì" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugation for the past tense (passato remoto) of regular -ere verbs. In this case, "dormire" changes to "dormì" when used with the subject "Gabriele".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "live" should be in the present tense instead of being conjugated with an s at the end to match the third person singular subject "one." Also, it would sound more natural to say "who live" rather than "that lives," as the former is used when referring to people and the latter for things.	I don't have any brothers or sisters who live near me.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "ci ha messo", and the past tense of the verb is used correctly to indicate that the action was completed in the past.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Leonardo ha sezionato il vecchio tiglio" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb form agrees with the number and gender of the subject. In this case, "ha sezionato" is the third person singular indicative tense of the verb "sezionare," which matches with the masculine singular noun "tiglio."	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Andrea è diventato in gamba" is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the verb "essere" which agrees with the subject "Andrea". Also, the adverbial expression "in gamba", meaning skillful or competent, is correctly used to describe someone's abilities or qualities.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha fatto gli auguri a Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for expressing an action performed by one person towards another using the past tense of the verb "fare." In this case, "ha fatto" is used correctly as the third-person singular form of the verb "fare," and both names are written with capital letters at the beginning, which is also grammatically correct.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses the present tense of the verb "chiedere" which matches with its subject "Sofia". Also, it correctly employs the informal singular form of the imperative mood "torni", as the person being addressed ("tu") is singular and informal.	Sophia asks you to return immediately.
0	The sentence "Che tu vada via dispiace a Beatrice." is not grammatically correct because it lacks a subject and the verb form does not match with the subject. It seems that there was an attempt to use indirect speech ("che + verb"), but this construction requires a proper subject before it.	Che **tu** ti dispiaccia di andar via dispiace a Beatrice.
1	La frase è grammaticalmente corretta poiché utilizza il verbo "entrare" all'imperativo con il pronome "una", riferendosi ad ogni persona del gruppo delle donne che devono entrare nell'ufficio separate gli uni dagli altri. Inoltre, si usa il pronome "il mio" prima di "ufficio" per indicarne la proprietà esclusiva.	Entrate nel mio ufficio una per una.
0	The verb "eruttare" does not mean what you think it means in this context. It is used to describe when volcanoes expel molten rock and gas. A more appropriate word for children burping would be "sbadigliare", although that doesn't quite fit the situation either - perhaps "emettevano rumori stomacali" or "si alzavano dal tavolo con uno scatto".	La frase non è corretta. Forse intendevate dire "I bambini emettevano rumori stomacali." oppure "I bambini si alzavano dal tavolo con uno scatto."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "ha" should agree with the subject "quell'uomo". It should be "ha" for third person singular subjects, not "ne", which is an adverb meaning "thereof" or "about it."	Quell'uomo lo ha fotografato. ("Lo" refers to something previously mentioned.)
1	The sentence "Andrea ha carezzato il volto di Beatrice." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and uses the appropriate form of the verb to indicate that the subject performs an action on something else ("carezza" requires the use of "ha").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il volto di Paola è carezzato." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, we have the subject "il volto di Paola" followed by the third-person singular verb form "è" which agrees with the gender and number of the subject. Moreover, the past participle "carezzato" also agrees with the gender and number of the subject through the use of the auxiliary verb "essere". Therefore, there are no apparent errors or violations of standard usage that would make the sentence unacceptable in formal written or spoken contexts.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The sentence "Edoardo ha fratturato il braccio di Maria" has the correct verb form for the third person singular masculine subject "Edoardo", which is "ha". It also uses the proper preposition to indicate possession of the broken arm belonging to Maria. Additionally, it employs the past tense correctly to describe an event that occurred in the past. Overall, this sentence demonstrates good use of Italian syntax and morphology.
1	The sentence "Leonardo has paralyzed Mary's arm." is grammatically correct and understandable.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il bambino" agrees with the singular verb form "pesava". Moreover, the adverb "pochi" correctly modifies the noun "mesi."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is "gli operai" which is plural, so the correct form of the verb to use would be "asfaltano", not "asfalta".	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "Gli operai asfaltano la strada."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Paola" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb form "elencò", which is the third person singular simple past tense of "elenchire". The direct object of the sentence is "l'invitato" (the guest).	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence contains an incorrect use of the past tense verb "ha meso" which should be "ha messo". Also, there is unnecessary use of the pronoun "e" and the word "ciò".	Alice ha messo gli abiti nell'armadio. (or simply "Alice mise gli abiti nell'armadio.")
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ciò" refers to something previously mentioned and it means "this" or "that". In this case, it refers to what happened in the wardrobe after Maria took off her clothes.	Maria ha tolto i vestiti e ciò è accaduto nell'armadio. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Beatrice riempe il frigo con frutta." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. In this case, the subject "Beatrice" agrees with the third-person singular present tense verb "riempe," which means "fills." Additionally, the preposition "con" meaning "with" introduces the direct object "frutta," or "fruit." This structure creates a complete thought that does not contain any grammar errors. Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: La frase "Beatrice riempe il frigo con frutta." è grammaticalmente corretta perché segue le regole della sintassi italiana e del concordanza dei verbi. In questo caso, il soggetto "Beatrice" si accorda con il verbo presente di terza persona singolare "riempe", che significa "riempire". Inoltre, la proposizione "con" che significa "con" introduce il complemento oggetto diretto "frutta", ovvero "frutta". Questa struttura crea un pensiero completo che non contiene errori grammaticali.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria defends Andrea from dangers" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Maria"), verb ("defends") and object ("Andrea"). Moreover, the preposition "from" correctly introduces the noun phrase "dangers."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il libro passa da Maria a Maria" is grammatically correct because both the subject and verb agree in number and it follows standard Italian syntax rules.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria gives a book to Paul" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Maria"), verb ("gives") and object ("a book"). The use of third person singular present tense agrees with the subject "Maria". Additionally, "to Paul" correctly uses an indirect object pronoun to indicate who receives the book.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Francesco delega Gabriele come suo rappresentante" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, the subject "Francesco" agrees with the third-person singular verb form "delega," which means "he/she/it delegates." Moreover, there are no apparent morphological or syntactic errors that would make the sentence incorrect. Therefore, I can confirm that:	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The use of "sua" instead of "la sua" might seem incorrect to some because it could be interpreted as the contraction of "su" + possessive adjective. However, both forms are commonly used in spoken language with no significant difference in meaning or formality level. So, this sentence can also be written as "Sofia delega Maria come la sua rappresentante."
0	The sentence contains two subjects ("Lorenzo" and "ciò") that should each have their own verb agreement. Instead, there is only one verb "abita." A correct version of the sentence would use "succedono" instead of "succede," so that it agrees with both subjects.	Lorenzo abita a Roma e ciò succede anche qui.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. It consists of two independent clauses connected by the conjunction "and". Both clauses have their subjects ("Riccardo" and "ciò") and verbs ("ha mangiato" and "è successo").	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Andrea ha spalmato il pane di paté." is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule with the singular third person verb form "ha" agreeing with the singular masculine noun "Andrea".

1	The sentence "Le bombe piovevano su di noi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in Italian. In this case, "bombe" is plural and agrees with the verb "piovevano," which is also plural to indicate that multiple bombs were raining down on them. Additionally, the preposition "su" followed by "di noi" clearly shows who was affected by the bombing.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form "dubita" which agrees with its subject "Paola".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "that" should agree with the subject of the sentence, which is "tu". Therefore, it should be "parti" instead of "parta".	Maria desidera che tu parti.
1	The sentence "Che Giulia sia sempre in viaggio piace ad Andrea." is grammatically correct because it uses the subjunctive mood correctly to express a hypothetical or uncertain situation.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Emma voluntarily fascinates Francesco. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "Francesco" matches with the verb conjugated in third person singular "desidera". Also, the infinitive form of the verb "venire" follows the subjunctive mood after the expression "che".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the appropriate use of verbs according to their subject-verb agreement, as well as accurate prepositions and articles.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "partire" should be conjugated to match the subject "Alessandro and Paola." A correct form would be "partano". Also, there is an extra "che" that doesn't belong in the sentence.	Alessandro invita Paola a partire.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Alice has accompanied Tommaso to the cinema. (In English, since the original sentence was already written in proper Italian.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La partenza apporta un beneficio a tutti. (The explanation states that the sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Si" is used here as an indirect reflexive pronoun referring to the subject of the sentence ("Alessandro"). This construction implies that Alessandro is doing the complaining himself, without any external help or influence.	Alessandro si lamenta del mare sporco con Paola. Confidence level: 95%
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "lasciare" agrees with its plural subject "Andrea and Leonardo."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is plural ("bambini"), so the correct form of the verb to use would be the third-person plural form, which is "don't" instead of "doesn't".	I bambini don't like spinach.
0	The phrase contains a slang expression that is not appropriate for formal or professional contexts. Also, the subject "mi" requires an object to complete its meaning.	La frase non è appropriata per questa valutazione; ecco una versione formale alternativa: "Mi infastidisco."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Alice si è attaccata a un capello. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence, followed by the auxiliary verb "ha" to form the compound tense "ha piantato," which means "has planted." The direct object follows, which is "Riccardo." Finally, we have the adverbial expression "in asso," meaning "to leave someone hanging or stranded."	Maria ha piantato Riccardo in asso.
1	The sentence "Sofia and Riccardo speak the same language." is grammatically correct because it uses the proper verb form "speak" to agree with the subject "Sofia and Riccardo," which is plural.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the phrase should be "Avere coraggio" instead of "Avere fegato". "Fegato" means liver and is not related to bravery or courage.	Avere coraggio.
0	The sentence contains the word "paturnies" which is not an Italian word and it seems to be misspelled or misused. I assume you meant "paure", that means "fears".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Avere paure."
0	The correct phrase should be "Avere le scatole" instead of "Avere sulle scatole." In Italian, the preposition "sulle" is not used with the noun "scatole," which means boxes or has the slang meaning of being annoyed. Instead, you would use the article "le" before "scatole" to indicate that it refers to something previously mentioned or understood from context.	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "Averle scatole."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a finite verb and a clear subject. It seems like the beginning of a phrase or quote from Dante Alighieri's "Divine Comedy," but as it stands alone, it does not form a complete thought.	A more appropriate way to use this line would be within its original context: "E io eravamo attoniti, ed ella sola / faceva motto, e dicea: 'Figliuoli, / guardate e attendete alle nostre parole'. // Poi si rivolse a me e disse: 'Lo spirito tuo / ne porta ancora impresso il nome mio; / ma qui convien ch'a te tutta sia nota'". In English: "[...] And we were dumbfounded—she was all that spoke; she said, 'My sons, give heed unto our words.' Then turning to me, she added: 'Thy spirit still bears upon him the imprint of my name; here it behoves thee utterly to know.'"
1	The phrase is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ciclone" can be used metaphorically to refer to a situation causing a lot of controversy or attention.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo spera che possa partire presto" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a subjunctive mood sentence in Italian. In this case, "possa" is the first person singular present tense of the verb "potere" (to be able to) used in the subjunctive mood. This form expresses doubt or uncertainty and fits well with the meaning of the sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "Beatrice". In Italian, subjects and verbs must match in number, so since "Beatrice" is singular, the correct form of the verb to use should be the third person singular ("ha") instead of the third person plural ("hanno").	Beatrice ha un'attenzione per Giulia. (The original sentence corrected.)
1	The sentence "Alice is anxious" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an English sentence with a subject ("Alice") and a verb ("is"). Additionally, "anxious" is used correctly as an adjective to describe how Alice is feeling.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "sta" should be replaced with the correct form of the third person singular present tense of the verb "stare", which is "sta". However, "donna" must also agree with the subject-verb agreement rule, so it needs to change from plural ("donne") to singular ("donna").	La donna sta andando al negozio.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object structure with proper agreement between subject ("la ragazza") and verb ("mangerà").	La ragazza mangerà la pizza. (The sentence is already correct.)

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The subject of the sentence "Beatrice" requires a third person singular verb form like "scappa". The use of the second person plural verb form "scappate" is incorrect.	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "Beatrice si scappa a comprare." (if we want to keep the colloquial tone) or "Beatrice scappa ad andare a fare shopping." for a more formal version.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order with plural subject "i libri" and corresponding verb form "mettono".

1	The sentence "Edoardo mette i libri sugli scaffali" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "mettere" should agree with the subject "Leonardo", so it should be "mette" instead of "mette". Also, there shouldn't be an accusative pronoun "ci" before "che".	I libri sono quello che Leonardo mette sugli scaffali ora. (Note that if you want to keep "ci" as part of the sentence, it can mean "there" and would require changing the word order: "Sugli scaffali, adesso ci mette i libri.")
1	The sentence "Andrea mangia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Andrea") and a verb ("mangia").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Questo lavoro è di competenza di Leonardo" means "This job belongs to Leonardo". The use of the singular form "è" instead of the plural "sono" is appropriate since we are referring to one subject ("this job").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "A" is used as a preposition to indicate possession or belonging, similar to the English "'s".

1	The sentence "Ha abboccato all'amo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugation for the passato remoto tense of the verb "abboccare." In this case, the subject "pesce" or "it" is implied and understood to be masculine singular. Therefore, the verb must agree with that gender and number, resulting in "ha abboccato."	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "hanno" agrees with its plural subject "tutti."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The subject "gli" requires the third person singular form of the verb, which is "monta". Additionally, there should be an article before "la testa".	La sua sangue gli monta facilmente alla testa.

Pertanto, l'uso dell'articolo determinativo maschile plurale "quei" con il sostantivo "terreno" nella frase sopra citata rende la frase incerta dal punto di vista grammaticale.	Quei terreni danneggiano l'ambiente.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Gabriele has made Lorenzo write a letter to Riccardo.
0	The verb "ha fatto" should agree with the subject "il vento", and therefore it should be "Il vento lo ha fatto rompere".

0	The verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "il colonnello". It should be "fa" instead of "ha fatto".

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "doesn't" should agree with the third person singular subject "ragazzi". However, it is grammatically incorrect as the plural form of the verb "do" ("do") must be used instead.

1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha rotto il fidanzamento" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo") and a verb in past tense ("ha rotto"). Moreover, "il fidanzamento" is correctly used as a direct object to indicate what has been broken.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il caldo ha rovinato il cibo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar for subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the singular masculine noun "caldo" agrees with the third person singular verb "ha rovinato," which means "has ruined." Additionally, the direct object "il cibo" comes after the verb as required by SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Paola has neglected herself" is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense. In English, we use "has" with third person singular subjects like "Paola." Also, the past participle form of the verb "neglect," which is "neglected," agrees with the auxiliary verb "has."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. It follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject coming before the verb. In this case, "L'uomo" is the subject and "lavatosi ieri" describes what the man did yesterday.

1	The sentence "Andrea has scratched the car door" is grammatically correct because it follows the English subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb "piacere" should be used in this sentence. Instead of "hai piacere", it should be "ti piace".

Since the subject is "I due ragazzi", which is plural and masculine, the correct form of the verb to use would be "sono". However, the sentence incorrectly uses the singular form "sono".	I due ragazzi sono andati via.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "confronted" agrees with the subject "il disegno."	La frase è già corretta. Note: I added capitalization and punctuation to make the sentence complete for clarity.
0	The correct form of the verb to use with "telefoni cellulari" is "proibiti", not "prohibit". Also note that there should be an accent on the word "proibiti" so it's grammatically correct.	I telefoni cellulari sono proibiti.
0	The verb "impelere" does not mean to shed hair and it is not commonly used. Moreover, the sentence lacks proper agreement between subject and verb. A more appropriate word for shedding hair could be "perdere". Also, the correct form of the verb should agree with the number of the subject, which is singular in this case ("il gatto"). Therefore, we need to use "ha perso" instead of "hanno perduti".	Il gatto ha perso molti peli sul divano.

1	The sentence "Ha protrato l'interrogatorio per tutta la mattinata." is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation.

1	The sentence "Le vittorie hanno carburato il calciatore in una settimana" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar with regards to verb conjugations and word order.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.

1	The sentence "Le vendite sono aumentate del 10% in due anni" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in Italian. In this case, "le vendite" (the sales) is plural and requires the verb form "sono aumentate" to agree with it. Additionally, the phrase "del 10%" correctly uses the preposition "di" before a percentage value followed by the noun "%". The time frame for the increase is also clearly stated as "in due anni" (over two years). Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.

0	In questa frase ci dovrebbe essere un pronome oggetto dopo il verbo per completare la frase correttamente. Ad esempio, si potrebbe dire "Hai fatto un buon lavoro ieri, ______".

Pertanto, dipende dal contesto comunicativo se considerarla corretta o meno. Di norma, però, una frase senza un chiaro riferimento all'oggetto del verbo andrebbe modificata aggiungendo maggior dettaglio.	A seconda del contesto, la frase potrebbe essere lasciata così com'è oppure arricchita con ulteriori informazioni relative all'oggetto del verbo, ad esempio: "Hai fatto un buon lavoro ieri, grazie!" o "Hai fatto un buon lavoro ieri sul progetto XYZ".
0	In questa frase ci sono due errori grammaticali. Prima di tutto, il verbo al presente del indicativo per il terzo gruppo verbale come "mar" dovrebbe terminare con "-a", non "-at". Secondariamente, il verbo concordato nel maschile ("ha") anziché nel femminile ("ha") con il soggetto "il mar".	La mar ha començado a agitar-se. Nota: Ho corretto anche lo stacco di parola tra "la" e "mar", poiché gli articoli determinativi devono essere uniti ai sostantivi nelle forme catalane standard.
1	The sentence "La carne è saporita." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian declarative sentence and uses proper verb conjugation for third person singular subject ("la carne" - she/it/he + "è" which corresponds to "is").	La carne è saporita.
0	In this sentence, the plural form of the verbs ("son" instead of "è") is incorrect because the subject "il vini" is singular. Additionally, "vini" should be "vino," and "aceti" should be "aceto."	Il vino è aceto.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The use of the past participle "infeltrito" with the auxiliary verb "si è" to form the compound tense "passato prossimo" indicates that the action has been completed. In this case, it means that the woolen sweater has already shrunk or felted. Additionally, the definite article "il" before "pullover" specifies a particular sweater being referred to. Overall, the sentence follows proper Italian syntax rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense formation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence, followed by the auxiliary verb "si è" which agrees with the third person singular masculine gender of the subject. Then there is the past participle "fatto", which also has to agree with the gender and number of the subject, but since it ends in "-o", we know that it corresponds to the masculine gender and singular number. Finally, there is the adjective "simile" that describes the noun "scheletro". It is correctly placed after the word it refers to, so everything is fine from the grammar point of view.	Edoardo si è fatto simile a uno scheletro.
1	The sentence "La carne è diventata gustosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense.	La carne è diventata gustosa.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the proper subject-verb agreement and uses the past participle correctly with the auxiliary verb "essere" (to be).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The phrase is grammatically correct but the use of multiple synonyms for "complicated" can make it seem redundant or exaggerated. It adds emphasis to the situation being described as extremely tangled or intricate. However, this usage is acceptable and understandable in informal contexts.	La situazione è già corretta.
0	In the sentence "A Riccardo, questi argomenti non **l'**hanno convinto," there should be an agreement between the gender of the pronoun and the verb. Since "Riccardo" is masculine, the correct form of the past tense of the verb "convincere" for one person would be "lo ha convinto."	A Riccardo, questi argomenti non lo hanno convinto.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La follia spaventa Francesco. (The insanity frightens Francesco.) Confidence level: 95%
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. In Italian, "il ragazzo" requires the third person singular form of the verb, which is "ha," not "hanno." Also, there should be an article before "Maria."	Il ragazzo ha irritato Maria.

0	The verb "fare" should be followed by the infinitive form of another verb, not the past participle. In this case, it should be "far calmare". Also, there is no need for "a quel uomo", as it creates an ambiguity and makes the sentence sound strange. A more natural way to express what I believe was intended would be "Alice fece calmare Andrea." or "Alice fece tranquillizzare Andrea.", depending on the exact meaning that needs to be conveyed.	Alice ha fatto calmare ad Andrea. OR Alice ha fatto tranquillizzare Andrea.
0	The correct form should be "ha fatto preoccupare" instead of "hanno fatto preoccupare". Also, there is no need for the word "dalla" before "fidanzata".	Maria ha fatto preoccupare Gabriele per la fidanzata. Or an alternative acceptable version could be: "Maria ha reso nervoso Gabriele per quanto riguarda la sua fidanzata."
0	The correct form of the past participle for the verb "irretire" is "intrappolato" or "irretita", depending on the gender of the subject. In this case, since the subject is feminine singular ("Maria"), the correct past participle would be "irretita".	Maria ha fatto intrappolare/irretire Leonardo.
0	The subject "Riccardo" is singular and requires the verb to be conjugated as such. In this sentence, however, it is incorrectly matched with the plural form of the verb "sedurre."	Riccardo si siede.
0	The correct form of the past participle for "piacere" with the auxiliary verb "essere" should be "sia piaciuto". In this case, it is necessary to use the singular and masculine form because "Lorenzo" is a male name.	Lorenzo si è piaciuto per questo.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard structure for expressing an action performed by a subject to an object. In this case, "il ragazzo" is the subject who performs the action of "mangiando una mela".	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. Congratulations on providing a correctly written Italian sentence!
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but the meaning might not be clear to all readers because of the use of the word "illude". This verb usually means "to deceive" or "to delude", which implies an intentional act. If the intention was just to say that taxes will decrease and people are mistakenly believing this will solve their problems, then it would be better to use another verb like "fools" or "misleads". However, if the author really meant to imply some sort of deceitful behavior from those lowering the taxes, then the sentence is fine as it stands.	The fact that taxes will go down misleads citizens.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "ha" agrees with the singular third person feminine subject "Maria". Also, the preposition "di" followed by the neuter pronoun "ciò" correctly expresses fear or apprehension towards something previously mentioned.	Maria ha timore di ciò.

1	The sentence "Paola está en un estado de terror" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a Spanish sentence where the subject comes before the verb and adjectives come after the noun they modify. In this case, "Paola" is the subject, "está" is the third person singular form of the verb "estar," which means "to be," and "un estado de terror" is a prepositional phrase that modifies her state or condition.	La frase è già corretta.

The correct form would be "Il ragazzo è andato al parco" or, if referring to multiple boys, "I ragazzi sono andati al parco."	Il ragazzo è andato al parco.
0	The verb "si è rotto" should agree with the subject "Gabriele", so it should be changed to "ha sbagliato". Also, there is no direct object or preposition indicating what exactly Gabriele has gotten tired of regarding Maria.	La frase non è corretta. Una versione corretta potrebbe essere: "Gabriele ha sbagliato riguardo a Maria."

Here, "prese" is the third person singular past tense form of the verb "prendere", which agrees with the subject "Beatrice". Moreover, "fischi per fiaschi" is an idiomatic expression that means to be mistaken or confused about something. Therefore, there are no grammar mistakes in this sentence. Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: N/A	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso butta olio sul fuoco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence, with the subject coming before the verb and the object following both. In this case, the subject is "Tommaso," the verb is "butta" (the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "gettare"), and the object is "olio sul fuoco."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo tirò l'acqua al proprio mulino" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the past tense. In this case, the third-person singular masculine form of the verb "tirare" (to pull) is used correctly with the subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the preposition "al" is correctly used to indicate motion towards something possessed by the pronoun "proprio", which refers back to the subject "Riccardo". Therefore, there are no grammar errors in this sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb form "si diede," which is also in the past tense like the subject. Additionally, the direct object of the sentence, "la zappa," has been correctly positioned before the indirect object, "suoi piedi." Therefore, this sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Emma" agrees with the verb "ascolta," both being singular. Moreover, "un disco" indicates that she is listening to one specific record.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha toccato Emma" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence where the subject comes before the verb and uses the appropriate singular form of the past tense for "ha."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Fa" agrees with the subject "Riccardo", which is third person singular.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Di te" means "of you", while "ride" is the third-person singular form of the verb "ridere" (to laugh), which agrees with the subject "lui" (he). The word "beffarda" correctly describes how she is laughing at him.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso legge." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Tommaso") and a verb ("legge" which means "reads"). Moreover, the subject agrees with the verb in number and gender.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Gabriele fa una telefonata a Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject coming first and then the verb followed by the object. In this case, the subject is "Gabriele," the verb is "fa" which agrees with the singular subject, and the object is "una telefonata a Maria."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso dà un libro a Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, the subject "Tommaso" is singular masculine and agrees with the third person singular present tense form of the verb "dà". Additionally, the indirect object "Maria" correctly uses the preposition "a."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English the verb "have" can be used as an auxiliary verb to indicate possession or the perfect tense. Here it is being used with "Andrea" and "telephoned" to create the compound past perfect tense "had telephoned". This indicates that Andrea's action of calling happened before another past event (Giulia returning).	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Riccardo telefona ad Emma. (The sentence is already correct.)
0	In this case, the subject of the sentence is "il ragazzo" which requires the use of the singular form of the verb to agree with it. Therefore, the plural form used here ("sono") is incorrect.	La frase corretta sarebbe stata "Il ragazzo è andato via ieri sera." oppure "I ragazzi sono andati via ieri sera.", a seconda del numero dei soggetti coinvolti nella frase.
0	In Italian, the third person singular conjugation of verbs like "odiare" (to hate) requires an -a ending for he/she/it, but not for they. Therefore, "odia" should be used instead of "odias".	Leonardo odia Maria. (Note that I have corrected the sentence as requested.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features an alternative way of asking a yes-no question through the use of rising intonation at the end of the statement "Leonardo odia Paola". This form is often used to ask for confirmation about something that has been previously stated or implied. However, it might also be interpreted as expressing surprise or disbelief. In either case, both the syntax and semantics are consistent with standard Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro andò a salutare il padre." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense usage. In this case, "andò" is the past tense form of "andare," which means "to go," and it agrees with its singular masculine subject "Alessandro." Additionally, "il padre" is correctly used as the direct object here. Therefore, there are no apparent errors or awkward constructions that would make the sentence difficult to understand for native speakers.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Alessandro girò, con l'auto, a raccoglierla. (No correction needed as the given sentence is already grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Viró" is the third person singular indicative imperfect tense of the verb "virare", which means to turn or veer. It is used here to indicate that the boat turned in order to save someone.	La motovedetta virò per salvarli.
1	The sentence "Andrea always obeys him." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "I soldati han passing the weapons to the prisoners" is grammatically incorrect because of the verb tense used in "han passing". It should be "have passed", which is the correct past participle form.	I soldati hanno passato le armi ai prigionieri. (The sentence is already correct.)
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, there are two subjects ("bambini" and "canta"), so we need to use a plural form of the verb. Also, "cantare" is the infinitive form; it should be changed to third-person singular present tense, which is "canta". Therefore, the correct sentence would have been "ballano e cantano", or if you want to keep them separated, then "I bambini ballano e il/la cantante canta."	I bambini ballano e cantano.
1	The sentence "Il cedro ama la libertà" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("il cedro") and a predicate ("ama la libertà"). Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il giardiniere" agrees with the verb "ha potato", and the object of the sentence "il barboncino di Edoardo" is correctly expressed as a definite article plus an adjective that describes the noun. Additionally, the preposition "di" is used correctly to indicate possession.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In this sentence there is a confusion between direct and indirect object pronouns. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence so it cannot be both the indirect object ("gli") and the subject at the same time. It should be "A Lorenzo, Alessandro le ha lasciato una ricca eredità." or "Lorenzo ha ricevuto una ricca eredità da Alessandro".	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "A Lorenzo, Alessandro le ha lasciato una ricca eredità." oppure "Lorenzo ha ricevuto una ricca eredità da Alessandro".
1	The sentence "Alessandro beve il suo caffè." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject coming first and then the verb. In this case, "Alessandro" is the subject and "beve" is the verb that agrees with the third person singular masculine form.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Alessandro desidera rivedere Beatrice. (No correction needed as the given sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the correct use of singular and plural forms, subject-verb agreement, word order, prepositions, articles, and adjective agreement with noun gender.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "doesn't" should agree with the subject "bambini," which is plural. Therefore, it should be "don't" instead of "doesn't". Also, the third person singular form of verbs must end in "-s" or "-es", so "like" should remain as it is.	I bambini don't like spinach.
1	The sentence "Gabriele segue una rigida condotta morale" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, the subject "Gabriele" is followed by the verb "segue," which agrees with the subject in number and person. Additionally, the adjective "rigida" modifies the noun "condotta" and agrees with it in gender and number. Therefore, there are no apparent errors or violations of standard Italian grammar in this sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "il frigorifero". Also, it uses a human quality ("cotta") to describe an object which is not appropriate.	La frase non è corretta. Una versione corretta potrebbe essere: "Il frigorifero mantiene freddo Francesco."
1	The sentence "Tommaso diede degli schiaffi a Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and verb conjugation for the past tense. In this case, "diede" is the third person singular of the verb dare in the passato remoto tense, which agrees with the subject "Tommaso". Additionally, "agli" is the appropriate contraction to use before masculine plural nouns like "schiaffi", so the overall structure and syntax are accurate.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Riccardo allungò uno schiaffo a Giulia. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Riccardo resta in silenzio. (The given sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Riccardo non ha più sospetti su Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, "non ha" is the negated form of the third-person singular present tense of the verb "avere" ("to have"), which agrees with the subject "Riccardo". Additionally, "più" indicates that there were previously some suspicions but not anymore. Finally, "su" means "about", indicating the topic or person being discussed. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Riccardo no longer has any suspicions about Emma."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo riceve aiuto da Edoardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo") and a verb ("riceve") conjugated correctly for that subject, as well as a direct object ("aiuto") and its source indicated by "da" ("Edoardo").	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to agree with "Beatrice" should be used. In this case, it should be "agita" instead of "agites".	Alessandro agita Beatrice. (The sentence is already grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence "Edoardo fa friggere l'uovo nella padella." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of Italian sentences.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo procede al caricamento del camion di casse" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular present tense ("procede").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Inchiostro" means ink and "rosso" means red; together they form the phrase for "red ink." A fountain pen contains or holds this type of ink.	L'inchiostro rosso è la carica della stilografica. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "La penna stilografica è caricata" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "la penna stilografica" is feminine singular and agrees with the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "essere," which is "è."	La penna stilografica è caricata.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	The sentence "Tommaso fruga nei cassetti della scrivania di Giulia." is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea sta caricando l'orologio." is grammatically correct because it uses the present participle form of the verb "caricare" which is "stanno caricando". However, since we are referring to one person ("Andrea"), we use the third person singular form "sta", so the corrected sentence would be:	Andrea sta caricando l'orologio.
0	The verb "dà" should agree with the subject "Riccardo," which is singular. Therefore, it should be "da" instead of "dà."	Riccardo da molte bottiglie al cane. (if we assume that the intended meaning is that Riccardo gives many bottles to the dog) or Riccardo batte molto il cane. (if we assume that the intended meaning is that Riccardo hits the dog hard)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject of the sentence, followed by the verb "sale" which agrees with the third person singular subject. Then there is "per una seconda volta", an adverbial phrase that modifies how the action takes place, and finally "le scale di corsa", the direct object of the sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Beatrice has the task to kidnap Emma" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Beatrice"), a helping verb ("has"), and a gerund phrase acting as the direct object ("the task to kidnap Emma").	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "corre" should agree with the subject "Alessandro", which is masculine singular. Therefore, it should be "corre" and not "corrono".	Alessandro correre l'asina. The correct sentence would actually be "Alessandro cavalca l'asina."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	The sentence "Francesco prende il cervo per le corna e lo atterra" is already correct.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "il frigorifero." In this case, it should be "il frigorifero è," not "il frigorifero ha."	Il frigorifero è stato derubato da un gatto. (The refrigerator has been robbed by a cat.) Note: I changed the sentence to make it more logical and meaningful while maintaining the same structure as the original sentence.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "il frigorifero." Also, the verb "sedurre" cannot be used in this context as it implies an intentional action that is out of place when describing an inanimate object like a refrigerator.	Il frigorifero poggia su un tavolo.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is a missing subject and verb agreement error. It should be "Riccardo ha sedotto *una ragazza minorenne*".	La frase corretta sarebbe stata: "Riccardo ha sedotto una ragazza minorenne."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta. The word "applaudì" agrees with the subject "la sala", which is feminine singular, so the use of the past tense conjugated as "applaudì" is appropriate here. Additionally, the adjective "tutto" should be used before the noun it modifies, so using "tutta" to agree with "sala" is also correct. Therefore, this sentence can be considered fully grammatically correct in Italian.
1	The sentence "Paola ha letto un libro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha letto" (third person singular form of the past tense of the verb "leggere") agrees with its subject "Paola".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, "biglietti" is needed instead of "biglietto".	Maria collects love letters. Or if you want to keep it in Italian: Maria raccoglie biglietti d'amore.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha tosato lo zio." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all of the words are used correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo scambia libri con Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, we have two people, named Riccardo and Maria, who are engaging in an action, which is "scambiare" or to exchange. This verb agrees with its subject, Riccardo, and is conjugated correctly in the third person singular present tense. Moreover, the preposition "con" indicates that both individuals are participating in the action together. Therefore, there are no grammar errors in this sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Alice has curved her forehead. (English translation of the given Italian sentence)
1	The sentence "Maria ha curvato la faccia." is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Sofia maintains head to the enemy" is grammatically correct but it might not convey the intended meaning properly as it does not include a preposition that would indicate how or in what way Sofia keeps her head towards the enemy. A more clear and idiomatic option could be "Sofia keeps her head up against/facing the enemy". However, since the original sentence is already grammatically correct I will leave it as is.	Sofia maintains head to the enemy.
1	The sentence "Alessandro si gonfia la testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper conjugation for the third person singular masculine form of the verb "gonfiare". Additionally, all nouns and adjectives are correctly declined according to gender and number.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Beatrice has stood up Giovanna" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard structure of expressing a concept with a subject ("capire", to understand) and an object ("le intenzioni segrete di una persona", the secret intentions of a person).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Maria cambia le carte" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and uses the correct form of the verb "cambiare."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "Riccardo" which is third person singular. Therefore, it should be "fa male" instead of "fa a cattivo".	Riccardo fa male il gioco.
0	The correct form of the past tense for the verb "rompere" with third person singular subject is "ha rotto". Therefore, it should be "Andrea ha rotto il collo a Beatrice", not "Andrea hanno rotto il collo a Beatrice."	Andrea ha rotto il collo a Beatrice.
0	The verb "rompe" should agree with the subject "la musica." In this case, it should be "rompe" instead of "rompes". Also, there is no need for an article before "orecchie."	La musica rock rompe las orecchias. (In Spanish, not Italian - my apologies!) The correct sentence in Italian would be: "Il rock rompe gli occhi," which means something like "Rock music is hard on the ears," but it doesn't have the same meaning as "breaks your ears."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "ha dato", and the indirect object "Tommaso" has been mentioned before, so it can be used without a preposition or an article.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La mosca salta al naso di Riccardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are used correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct phrase should be "Andarsene" or "Lasciare il posto", while the expression "Andare a monte" means to fail or come to nothing.	La persona dovrebbe andarsene dal posto oppure lasciarlo. Alternatively, if you want to say that something has failed, use "Andare a monte".
0	La frase manca il verbo ausiliario necessario per formare una proposizione corretta nel presente indicativo del tempo verbale. Inoltre, non c'è alcun soggetto chiaro nella frase.	La frase non è corretta. Una versione corretta potrebbe essere "Sono alla fine dell'elenco" oppure "Si trova all'indice".
1	The phrase "Mettere all'indice" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian grammar for forming verbs and nouns. It can be translated to English as "To put on the index."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The phrase "Alzare il gomito" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It translates to "to raise one's elbow," which is an idiomatic expression that means to drink alcohol excessively or too often. In this case, the verb "alzare" agrees with its subject "one."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct phrase should be "Perdere la testa" or "Perdere il senno", as "perdere il lume della ragione" is not an idiomatic expression in Italian.	La frase corretta sarebbe stata "Perdere la testa" o "Perdere il senno".
1	The phrase "Cavare la castagne dal fuoco a qualcuno" is grammatically correct and understandable in Italian. It means to bail someone out or help them get out of trouble.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The phrase contains a common typographical error where "canne" should be "canna." Additionally, there is no verb connecting the two parts of the sentence together. A correct form could be "Essere poveri in canna non è una situazione desiderabile," meaning "Being poor with a gun isn't a desirable situation." However, without additional context it is difficult to provide an accurate correction.	La frase corretta potrebbe essere "Essere poveri in canna non è una situazione desiderabile," ma dipende dal contesto specifico.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "L'angelo" means "the angel," "custode" means "guardian or protector," and "fantasia" means "imagination."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Essere" agrees with the singular subject "lo smoking," which requires the third person singular form of the verb to be "è."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "nuotare" (to swim) should be used with subjects that can actively move through water, such as humans or animals. In this case, the subject is an object ("la moto"), which cannot swim. A correct alternative would use a different verb to describe the condition of the motorcycle.	La moto di Leonardo è come nuova.
1	The sentence "Ho visto un'unità in marcia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject ("Io") implied and the verb ("ho visto", past tense of "vedere") coming before the object ("un'unità in marcia").	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" requires the third person singular form of the verb "piacere", which should be "piace". Also, there must be an accusative object for the verb "piacere", so it should be something like "Che **a Maria** piaccia il ritorno di Leonardo."	Che a Maria piaccia il ritorno di Leonardo.
1	The sentence "Sofia corre a mangiare" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb conjugations for each tense.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea sorride a Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an Italian sentence and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects and objects.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but can be improved for clarity and formality. "Bada" should be replaced with the more formal alternative "si assicuri". Also, there should be a comma after "Beatrice."	Beatrice, si assicuri che l'articolo sia chiaro.
1	The sentence "Alessandro sta divorziando da Paola" is grammatically correct because it uses the present participle form of the verb "divorziare", which indicates an action that is currently ongoing or has recently started. In this case, the subject "Alessandro" is performing the action of divorcing his wife "Paola". The use of the gerund ("stare") adds emphasis to the fact that the divorce process has already begun.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo abita in una casa piccola." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and predicate ("abita in una casa piccola"). Moreover, all words are correctly conjugated for gender and number agreement.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "estar" should be used instead of "esta". Also, there is a missing accent on the word "no". In Spanish, it should be "María no está en Roma."	María no está en Roma.
0	La parola errata nella frase è "stele" anziché "stelle". In italiano, il termine corretto per riferirsi ai piccoli oggetti rotondi presenti nel firmamento è "stelle", mentre "stele" si usa per indicare grandi lastre di pietra erette come monumenti commemorativi o lapidi.	Mille stelle brillano nel cielo.
1	The phrase is grammatically correct with the exception of capitalizing the first letter of the sentence and adding punctuation at the end. This minor issue does not affect the overall meaning or structure of the sentence. Explanation in English: The phrase is grammatically correct except for the lack of initial capitalization and ending punctuation. These issues do not significantly impact the meaning or structure of the sentence.	"Ciò guarda questa cosa." (with proper capitalization and punctuation added)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct but it can be improved for clarity and conciseness. "Tre ore al giorno" already implies that Leo studies them every day, so the repetition of "tutti i giorni" is unnecessary. Also, there should be an article before "tre ore."	La frase è già corretta, but to improve its clarity and concision, we could say: "Leonardo studia loro intensamente per tre ore al giorno."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "tocco" must agree with the gender and number of the subject that performs the action. In this case, since the subject is feminine singular ("la parete"), the masculine singular form "toccò" would be incorrect. Instead, we use the feminine singular form "toccata".	La parete è toccata dalle spalle di Riccardo.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Lorenzo tocca la schiena di Paola. (The sentence is already correct.)
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper subject and verb agreement. "Derives" should be used instead of "deriva" to agree with the plural subject "such a conclusion."	Such a conclusion derives.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mangia poca frutta." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the singular form of the verb ("mangia") agrees with the singular subject ("Gabriele"). Additionally, the adjective "poca" correctly modifies the noun "frutta".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, the correct form of the verb to use is the second person singular ("bevi") but it was given as the first person plural ("bevi").	Andrea beve.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "pizzica" does not agree with the subject "Francesco". A masculine singular third-person present tense verb should be used instead to match the gender and number of the subject.	Francesco piglia con sadismo. (or Francesca pigliava con tristezza if referring to a female named Francesca)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	Alessandro disegna sul muro. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Lorenzo sta ballando la rumba." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugation and word order.

1	The sentence "La siesta es una pequeña dormida" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a Spanish sentence with a subject ("la siesta") and a predicate ("es una pequeña dormida"). Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated for gender, number, and tense agreement.	La siesta es una pequeña dormida. (The siesta is a short nap.)
1	The sentence "Francesco nuota a rana" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Francesco") and a verb ("nuota") conjugated correctly according to the subject and time indicated by the adverb "a rana", which refers to the swimming style used by the subject.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this sentence, the subject is "pomodori" which is plural, but the verb used is "fa" that agrees with a singular noun. Therefore, the verb form is incorrect.	I pomodori fanno male alla salute.
1	The sentence "Tutti bevono il tè amaro" is grammatically correct because it uses the plural form of the verb "bere" which agrees with the subject "tutti", and correctly uses the singular definite article "il" before "tè".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "I lavori fatti hanno reso più larga la piazza" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for compound tense correctly. In this sentence, "lavori" which means "jobs" or "works", agrees with its past participle form "fatti". Also, the auxiliary verb "hanno" agrees with the subject "lavori." Lastly, the meaning of the sentence is clear and understandable. Therefore, no correction needs to be made.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso afferra il gatto" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object order and uses proper singular nouns and verbs that agree with each other.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" is singular and matches with the verb "riflette", which is also in its third person singular form ("riflettE").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Discutere" can be used both transitively and intransitively; when it is used intransitively as in this case, it does not require an object, so the sentence is fine without one.	Andrea discute la validità delle affermazioni di Maria. (no change needed since the original sentence was already grammatically correct.)
