0	Morphology Explanation: The verb "divorata" does not agree with the subject of the sentence, which is "il polpo." In Italian, past participle verbs must agree in gender and number with the direct object if it comes before the verb and there is no auxiliary verb present. Since "Sofia" is a feminine singular noun, the correct form should be "divorata". However, since the direct object ("il polpo") follows the verb, there is no need for agreement between the past participle and the direct object. Therefore, the correct form would actually be "Il polpo ha divorato Sofia", but I will assume that this mistake was made while trying to follow the rule mentioned above. So, the corrected sentence without changing the word order would still have an error because the verb needs to change from "divorata" to "ha divorato": "Il polpo ha divorato da Sofia." This correction results in a semantic error, as having something being eaten by someone doesn't make sense when using "da" instead of "di," making the whole sentence incorrect even after morphological corrections. Thus, we keep the original phrasing as the only possible way to construct such a sentence correctly, just fixing the verb form. Correct Sentence: Il polpo lo divora, ed è Sofia. (The octopus devours him/it, and that is Sophia.)tThe verb "divorata" does not agree with the subject of the sentence, which is "il polpo."

0	Morphology Explanation: The sentence is not correct because the verb "distributes" does not agree with its subject "Lorenzo". In English, verbs must match their subjects in number (singular or plural).

Instead, you should use the base form of the verb ("distribute") when the subject is singular. Correct Sentence: Lorenzo distributes bricks. (incorrect) Correct Sentence: Lorenzo distributes a brick. (correct if we assume that Lorenzo only gives out one brick at a time) Correct Sentence: Lorenzo distributes bricks. (correct if we mean that Lorenzo hands out multiple bricks)tThe sentence is not correct because the verb "distributes" does not agree with its subject "Lorenzo".

0	Syntax Explanation: The sentence is not grammatically correct because the object of the verb "travestì" should be in the accusative case and match the gender and number with the verb conjugation.

0	Morphology Explanation: The verb "desires" should be "desireses" or better yet, simply "wants", to agree with the subject "Tu" which is second person singular in English.

0	Morphology Explanation: The error is morphological because the word "fumo" should be "fuma" to agree with the subject "Riccardo". In Italian, verbs must match their subjects in number and gender. Here, since "Riccardo" is singular and masculine, we need to use the third person singular form of the verb "andare", which is "va". So, it should be "Riccardo va al fumo." instead of "Riccardo va al fumo." Correct Sentence: Riccardo va al fumo.tThe error is morphological because the word "fumo" should be "fuma" to agree with the subject "Riccardo".

1	Correct Explanation: The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable. Correct Sentence: Alice longs to return. Note: In English, the verb "to crave" typically requires an object or complement following it, whereas "long for" can be followed by just a noun phrase without any preposition required. Therefore, while both sentences are technically grammatically correct, using "longs to return" might sound more natural than "craves to return." However, as your task was simply to determine whether the given sentence is acceptable, I marked it as correct since its meaning is clear despite being slightly less common.tThe sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.

It does not suggest any special connotation of "naso" related to being hit by a flying object.tLa mosca salta al naso di Riccardo. Reference(s): - [The Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/definition/mosca) defines "mosca" as an insect that can fly and bite people or animals to suck their blood. It also mentions its use in the phrase "la mosca cieca," which means blind man's buff. However, it does not mention any idiomatic meaning of "mosca" related to jumping on someone's nose. Therefore, I assume that "mosca" here refers to the actual insect. - [Treccani Vocabulary](<https://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/naso>)(https://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/naso) explains that "naso" is the organ located in the middle of the face, above the mouth and below the eyes, used for smelling and breathing. It does not suggest any special connotation of "naso" related to being hit by a flying object.
