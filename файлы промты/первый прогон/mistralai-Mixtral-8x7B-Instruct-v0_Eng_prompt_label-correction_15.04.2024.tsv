0	The corrected sentence is "Voglio salutare Giulia." In your original sentence, there is an extra "di" that needs to be removed.
0	The sentence "Ho voglia di salutare Sofia." appears to be in Italian and does not follow standard English grammar rules. A correct English version of the sentence could be "I want to greet Sophia."
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Il mio preferito è la Divina Commedia." In your original sentence, you used two possessive adjectives ("mio" and "lo") together which is redundant and unnecessary in Italian.
0	The sentence "Il mio treno preferito è la Divina Commedia." is incorrect because "treno" means train in English, while "Divina Commedia" refers to Dante Alighieri's famous work. A possible correction could be: "Il mio libro preferito è la Divina Commedia.", which translates to "My favorite book is the Divine Comedy".

1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it appears to be grammatically correct.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "I prezzi sono aumentati." in Italian, but since you asked for grammatical correctness in English, it's important to note that this sentence is written in a foreign language. In English, a possible equivalent could be "Prices have increased," which is grammatically correct.

0	You should have said "I met Lorenzo, not Emma." The original sentence "Ho incontrato Lorenzo, non Emma" is in Italian, while the prompt asks for an English sentence.
0	The sentence "Non guardarlo." appears to be in Italian, but as an English language grammar checker, I can only assess its grammaticality in English. In English, the sentence would translate to "Don't save him," which is grammatically correct with appropriate context. However, without further information about the intended language of the original sentence, I cannot definitively determine its grammaticality.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's an Italian sentence that means "I met many of Riccardo's friends" and it is grammatically correct in Italian.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian that means "I did not find your book in that library."
0	The sentence "Non ce ne ho trovati molti." appears to be in Italian and may be grammatically correct in that language. However, since you did not specify the desired language for the sentence, I will assume you want it translated into English. A corrected version of your sentence could be: "I haven't found many of them." This translation keeps the original meaning as much as possible while ensuring grammatical correctness in English.

1	The sentence is already correct. It's grammatically correct Italian. Here's the English translation for clarity: "Andrea was met by Leonardo."

1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it appears to be grammatically correct. The translation of "In quale cassetto Leonardo ha messo i fogli?" to English is "In which drawer did Leonardo put the papers?"
0	The correct form of the question would be "Quali politici hanno parlato?" in Italian, which means "Which politicians have spoken?" The original sentence had an error in the use of the singular form "quale" instead of the plural form "quali".
0	The sentence contains grammatical errors and is not understandable in its current form. A corrected version could be: "Quale politico ha detto (that) la radio ha riferito (that) il giudice ha dichiarato (that) egli ha parlato?" This translates to: "Which politician did the radio report that the judge declared had spoken?"
1	The sentence is already correct. It's grammatically correct in Italian. Lorenzo ha detto che partirà domani means "Lorenzo said that he will leave tomorrow" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. It is a grammatically correct Italian sentence.
0	The sentence "Chi tocca i fili muore." appears to be in Italian and it translates to "Who touches the wires dies" in English. However, without additional context, I cannot determine if it's grammatically correct for a specific use case in Italian. But based on my knowledge of Italian grammar rules, the word order seems to follow standard Italian syntax. Nonetheless, since you didn't ask for its translation, I will assume that there might be some errors in the sentence. Therefore, I would recommend double-checking with a native speaker or using an Italian language reference source to ensure complete accuracy.
1	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence is already correct. It's a grammatically correct Italian sentence.
0	The sentence "Il fatto di essere stato scoperto un delitto" is incorrect because it lacks proper agreement between the past participle "scoperto" and its direct object "un delitto". It should be "Il fatto di averlo scoperto è che un delitto è stato commesso", which means "The fact of having discovered it is that a crime has been committed." In Italian, when using compound tenses with an auxiliary verb such as "essere" (to be), any direct objects must agree in gender and number with the reflexive pronoun "lo", "la", "li", or "le".
0	The sentence "Chi pensi che Alessandro incontrerà?" appears to be written in Italian, while I am designed to evaluate English sentences only. If we translate it into English, the sentence would read as "Who do you think that Alexander will meet?" which contains an unnecessary relative pronoun "that". A more appropriate way of expressing this idea in English would be "Who do you think Alexander will meet?" Therefore, based on English grammar rules, the original sentence can be considered incorrect.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's an Italian sentence that means "The chair you sat on is broken."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Edoardo crede chi Sofia abbia baciato." is incorrect because it uses "chi" instead of "che". A correct version would be "Edoardo crede che Sofia l'abbia baciato." This means "Edoardo thinks that Sofia kissed him.", where "l'" refers back to "Edoardo".
0	The sentence "Che problema non sai come potremo risolvere?" appears to be in Italian. Its English translation is "What problem don't you know how we can solve?" This sentence has grammatical issues in English. A corrected version could be "I wonder what problem you don't know how we can solve."
0	The correct form of the sentence in English would be "I saw him." In Italian, it should be "L'ho visto" instead of "Abbia visto lui", which is grammatically incorrect.
0	The corrected sentence should be "Abbiamo visto lui." since "lo" in this context requires a specific direct object pronoun agreement with the verb "abbiamo visto".
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The corrected sentence would be "Beatrice ha dichiarato di non aver avuto nulla a che fare con Gabriele." In your original sentence, there were some issues with verb tenses and pronoun usage that needed correction.

0	The sentence "Che libro dice che il professore ha raccomandato di leggere?" is not in English. Here's the corrected version of the sentence in English: "Which book does it say that the professor recommended reading?"
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Per primo sono arrivato io, non tu." In Italian, "me" becomes "io" when used as the subject in the first person singular pronoun.
1	The sentence is already correct. (Arriva un uomo is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard Subject-Verb-Object word order.)
0	The sentence "Leonardo uccise Andrea." appears to be in Italian. In English, it would translate to "Leonardo killed Andrew" which contains grammatical errors as both "Leonardo" and "Andrew" need articles before them according to English language rules.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatical Italian sentence that can be translated as "Andrea said that Tommaso looks at him."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence.
0	The sentence "Da quel professore, Tommaso non è stato ancora interrogato?" is not grammatically correct in Standard Italian. A corrected version could be: "È stato ancora interrogato Tommaso da quel professore?" which means "Has Tommaso been questioned by that teacher yet?"
1	The sentence is already correct. It is grammatically correct in Italian and means "Alessandro believes that we will invade that country."
0	With regard to these countries, which one does Andrea believe will invade? Explanation: In English, we use "which one" instead of "qualche" when referring to a single item in a group. Also, it's more common to say "with regard to" than "a proposito di". Finally, we would typically use a future tense for this type of question, so I changed "will invade" to "will be invading."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence. It means "Last year, Alessandro was writing a book, but he still hasn't finished it today."
1	The sentence is already correct. It is grammatically correct in Italian.
0	The sentence "Gabriele è scapolo ed è sposato" is grammatically incorrect because a person cannot be both single (scapolo) and married (sposato) at the same time. It seems there might have been an error in constructing the sentence.
1	The sentence is already correct. It is grammatically correct in Italian and means "The current king of France is bald."
1	The sentence is already correct. This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct based on my knowledge of the language. "Qualche" means "some", "studente" is plural for student, so "qualche studente" would translate to "some students". "Ha superato" means "have surpassed" or "have passed", and "l'esame" refers to "the exam". Therefore, the translation would be something along the lines of "Some students have passed the exam."
0	If any student has not passed the exam, then no student has passed the exam. (Note that the original sentence in Italian translates to "If some students have not passed the exam, then every student has not passed the exam." However, the English equivalent I provided changes "every" to "no", as the two phrases do not convey the same meaning.)
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. It is grammatically correct in Italian.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is an Italian sentence that means "I took the keys" in English.
0	The corrected sentence would be: "Andrea, trasmettendo le commissioni della marchesa, disse: 'Darete loro il buongiorno'". In the original sentence, "trasmettendoci" should be in the simple past tense ("trasmise") instead of present participle form, and "ha detto" should be replaced with "disse" since it creates an indirect speech context.
0	A nice house is comfortable. (This is a correction for the original sentence since "Una bella casa fa comodo" does not make sense in Italian; it would be more natural to say "Una bella casa è confortevole," but I provided an English translation as per your instruction.)
0	The sentence "Prendiamo questo." appears to be in Italian, but as a grammaticality checker for English sentences, I cannot evaluate its correctness. However, if you're looking for an English equivalent, it could be something like "Let's take this one."
0	The correct form of the sentence is "Uso la spada." in Italian as "gladio" is an old term for sword which is usually used with an adjective such as "romano".
1	The sentence is already correct. This sentence appears to be written in Italian and it seems grammatically correct to me as a non-native speaker. "Il calcolatore" means "the calculator", while "funziona bene" means "works well". Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "The calculator works well."
0	The sentence "Scusa!" would be correct in an appropriate context if it's understood as a contraction of "scusami" which means "excuse me" or "sorry" in Italian. However, without any additional context provided in English, it seems grammatically incorrect because "scusa" is not a standard word or phrase in English language.
1	The sentence is already correct. (Note: This is an Italian sentence meaning "the girls have arrived". I am assuming that you want me to check it for grammaticality in Italian.)
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The corrected sentence would be "Leggo velocemente." in Italian as "velocemente" agrees with the subject "io" which is implied in the verb conjugation of "leggo".
0	The sentence "Andando a casa, ho incontrato tuo fratello." would be grammatically correct if "tuo" were changed to "tuo/a," depending on your brother's gender, as it needs to agree with "fratello." Here is the corrected sentence: "Andando a casa, ho incontrato tuo/a fratello."
0	The sentence "Sto andando a prendere la macchina." is in Italian and does not follow standard English grammar rules. A possible correct English version could be: "I am going to get the car."
1	The sentence is already correct. (Note: This is an Italian sentence that translates to "It is not true that places change their appearance as human faces do." It appears to be grammatically correct.)
0	The sentence "Va' a casa!" is not grammatically correct in English. A more appropriate translation of "I am going home" from Italian would be "Vado a casa."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is an Italian sentence that means "I am hungry."
0	The sentence "Bravo, questo ragazzo." would be grammatically correct in Italian, but as it stands, it's not understandable in English. If you want to say "Bravo, this boy" in English, you should use an article before "boy". So, the corrected version of your sentence will be : "Bravo, this boy."
1	The sentence is already correct. It is grammatically correct in Italian.
0	The sentence "Cosa fai domani?" is in Italian and translates to "What are you doing tomorrow?" in English. However, as it stands, it's not grammatically correct for an English conversation.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "I saw the book that you gave me."
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Gli amici **di** cui il maestro è Andrea." In your original sentence, there's a missing preposition "di" before "cui".
1	The sentence is already correct. (This is because "Credo che tu abbia ragione" is a grammatically correct Italian sentence.)
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This Italian sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It translates to "They wanted to destroy it and they destroyed it" in English.

1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and means "the person who spoke to me" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct form of the sentence in English would be "It hurts my head." Since the original sentence is in Italian, it's important to note that "Fa male la mia testa" is grammatically incorrect in Italian as well. A proper way to say "My head hurts" in Italian would be "Mi fa male la testa".
0	The sentence "Ho due case." appears to be in Italian and does not follow standard English grammar rules. A corrected version of the sentence in English would be: "I have two houses."
0	The sentence "Ho delle case." seems to be in Italian and does not follow standard English grammar rules. A correct English version of that statement might be "I have some houses."
1	The sentence is already correct. (This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct.)
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "I cavalli sono animali resilienti." However, even with that correction it's worth noting that in English we would say "Horses are resilient animals," as the adjective comes before the noun in English.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it means "Someone came" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct. (This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence is already correct. Note: This sentence is in Italian and it means "I can come." It is grammatically correct in that language.

1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it means "Which boy opens the door."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian. It translates to "I heard the boys singing" in English.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "La macchina lo vuole lavare." This translates to "The car wants to wash him" in English. In your original Italian sentence, "lavarla" requires a feminine direct object pronoun, but since you're referring to "lui", which means "him," it needs to be masculine. Therefore, we replace "lo" with "la" for grammatical agreement.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's an Italian sentence that translates to "It's the mechanic who came" in English.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Venire a Napoli non è ciò che voglio." which means "Coming to Naples is not what I want." In your original sentence, "È venire" should just be "venire", and there needs to be something connecting the two clauses together such as "che" in my corrected version.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Hai presente Lorenzo?" appears to be in Italian. In English, it might translate to something like "Do you know Lorenzo?" However, as written, it does not appear to follow standard English grammar rules.
0	The sentence "E da quando vive in America?" appears to be written in Italian and does not follow standard English grammar rules. A possible correct version of the sentence could be "And when did he move to America?"
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian but it appears to be grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "Appena detto ciò, mi lasciò che piangevo e volevo dire molte cose." would be more grammatically correct as "Appena l'ho detto, lui se ne andò mentre piango e voglio dirti tante cose." In your original sentence, there were some inconsistencies in subject-verb agreement and pronoun usage which needed correction.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and translates to "Always be the same: a loyal, patient, and honest friend."
1	The sentence is already correct. It's an Italian sentence that means "Strong wind over the sea can cause storm waves."
0	The sentence "Piangere forte." is in Italian and it means "to cry hard" in English. However, as an English grammar rule, we would expect the subject ("you") before the verb in an imperative sentence, so it's not grammatically correct based on standard English rules. A more acceptable way of writing it in English could be "Cry hard." or "You, cry hard.", but without context, it might still sound unusual because such sentences can often come off as rude or harsh when used in direct speech.
0	The sentence "Ho preso in casa una specie di gatto." seems to be written in Italian. In English, it would translate to "I took in at home a type of cat.", which contains some grammatical errors. A more appropriate way to say it in English could be "I brought home a kind of cat."
0	The sentence "Ho preso dello zucchero." is not grammatically correct in English. A corrected version could be "I took some sugar," assuming that's what you intended to express in English.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and means "I don't like wine."
1	The sentence is already correct. This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct. "Quel che vendo" means "what I sell", and "è merce cinese" can be translated as "is Chinese goods". Therefore, the entire translation of the sentence would be "What I sell is Chinese goods."
0	The sentence "Mettere fretta" does not seem to be grammatically correct in English. If you meant to say "Hurry up" in Italian, it would be "Affrettati".

1	The sentence is already correct. It's an Italian sentence that means "All whales must be protected."
0	The sentence "Mettitelo bene in capo" does not appear to be grammatically correct in standard Italian. A more appropriate way to say it might be "Mettilo benissimo in testa," which means "Put it on very well at the top of your head."
0	This machine is old but new. (The original sentence is grammatically incorrect because "vecchia" means "old" and "nuova" means "new". You can't use both at the same time for the same object.)
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian that means "Leonardo does not know Maria."
1	The sentence is already correct. (The sentence "Il governo ha abolito la legge." appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct.)
0	The sentence "Ho spazzolato le scarpe." appears to be in Italian and it's difficult for me to accurately determine its grammaticality without understanding that language. However, if we translate it to English, it would mean "I brushed the shoes." which seems grammatically correct assuming it's used appropriately in a sentence. But as per your request to check the exact provided sentence, it's unintelligible for me due to linguistic constraints.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it means "Tommaso has been living there for ten years."
1	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence is already correct. It is in Italian and it means "to start an activity".

1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian, it means "Paola returned the book."
0	The sentence "Che cosa ha preso?" is in another language, but when translated to English it would be "What did they take?" so it's grammatically correct with respect to its original language, however for the purpose of evaluating English grammar, I will consider it as incorrect since it does not follow standard English syntax rules.

0	The sentence "Riccardo si lagna sempre" would be considered correct in certain languages such as Italian, but it contains grammatical errors when evaluated based on English language rules. A possible correct version of the sentence in English could be "Ricardo always complains."
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Con tutte le sue parole, Maria ha annuito." The original sentence contains an error as it uses "Alle" instead of "Con tutte le".
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Andrea ha sbadigliato?" is in a different language (Italian), so it's difficult for me to determine its grammatical correctness without knowing the intended context. However, I can tell you that "sbadigliato" is the past tense of "sbadigliare," which means "to yawn." So, the English equivalent could be something like "Did Andrea yawn?"
0	The sentence "Riccardo pedala" would be grammatically correct in certain contexts, but without more information it's difficult to say for sure. In Italian, "Riccardo pedala" means "Riccardo is cycling." If that is the intended meaning of the sentence, then it is grammatically correct as written. However, if the intended meaning is different, then a different form of the verb may be needed. For example, if the intended meaning is "Riccardo will cycle," then the correct sentence would be "Riccardo pedalerà."

0	The sentence should be "La lettera è scritta." instead of "La lettera scrive". In Italian, "scrivo" means "I write", while "è scritta" means "is written". Therefore, "La lettera è scritta" would mean "The letter is written".
0	The word "Disturbo" seems to be incomplete or used incorrectly. A possible correction could be "Do I disturb you?"
1	The sentence is already correct. The sentence "Leonardo sta compilando." appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct for that language. It translates to "Leonardo is compiling" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. (Note: This sentence appears to be in Italian, but I am only able to check for grammatical correctness based on English language rules.

0	The correct form of the verb "aumentare" in third person plural of present perfect indicative is "hanno aumentato". However, it requires a complete sentence with a subject for context.

1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Si è macchiata la tovaglia." appears to be in Italian and does not follow standard English grammar rules. A correctly written sentence in English with similar meaning could be: "She stained the tablecloth."
0	The English translation of "Macchia il vino" would be "Stain the wine", which is grammatically correct in Italian but lacks context in English. A more complete sentence with appropriate context could be: "He accidentally macchia il vino when he knocked over the glass."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Le tappe hanno bruciato per un'ora" is incorrect in English. A possible correct version could be "The steps have been burning for an hour," but I assume you meant it to be in Italian.

1	The sentence is already correct. This is an Italian sentence that means "He broke the glass." in English.

1	The sentence is already correct. (Note: This sentence appears to be in Italian and it translates to "The shirt is dirty" in English.)
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Ho notato un libro caduto." in Italian, but it's important to note that this sentence may still sound strange to native speakers because "un libro caduto" implies that the book has been dropped and is now lying on the ground, yet there's no context about who dropped it or where it is. A more natural way to express this might be "Ho visto un libro per terra" ("I saw a book on the ground").
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it means "Alessandro knows the streets."
0	The sentence "Andrea approfitta di Maria." is not grammatically correct in English. A corrected version could be "Andrea takes advantage of Maria," assuming that contextually it makes sense.

1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian but it appears to be grammatically correct. "Francesco è il capo" means "Francesco is the boss".
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Trenta chilogrammi sono stati pesati da Alessandro." as "chili" means "chiles" in Italian, while "chilogrammi" stands for kilograms which is what you mean here. Also, since it's talking about an action completed in past tense, we use "stati" instead of "sono".

1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Dove Riccardo mise la cassa nel mobile?" appears to be in Italian, while my expertise is primarily in English grammar. However, I can still identify some potential issues with it from an English language perspective. A more appropriate translation of that question into English might be "Where did Riccardo put the case in the cabinet?" instead of "Dove Riccardo mise la cassa nel mobile?". This would ensure better understanding by people who do not speak Italian but understand English.
1	The sentence is already correct. The sentence "Lo scoglio affiora." is in Italian and it means "The reef emerges" or "The reef surfaces". It's grammatically correct in Italian.
0	The sentence "Andrea si comporta." would be grammatically correct in certain contexts, but without additional information it's difficult to determine if it's appropriate in English. If you intended for it to be in Italian, then it is indeed grammatically correct as written. However, if your intention was to write it in English, it should be corrected to "Andrea behaves" to make it grammatically correct in that language.
0	The sentence "Leonardo sottrae la penna." appears to be in Italian and does not follow standard English grammar rules. A possible correct English version of the sentence could be "Leonardo takes the pen.", depending on context.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian - "Lorenzo takes the newspaper out of the safe."
0	The sentence "Alessandro legge un libro a letto." is in Italian. A corrected version in English would be: "Alessandro reads a book in bed."
0	Riccardo beve il caffè in una tazzina di porcellana. ("the" was changed to "il caffè")
0	The sentence "Dove Andrea ha preso una sigaretta?" appears to be in Italian and does not follow standard English grammar rules. A possible correct English version of the sentence could be "Where did Andrea take a cigarette?"
0	The sentence "Tommaso estrasse la pistola nel bar." appears to be written in Italian, not English. A corrected version of this sentence in English would be: "Tommaso drew the gun in the bar."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written Italian sentence that means "Riccardo eats the rice" in English.
0	The sentence "Tommaso vi sostiene la lastra" would be grammatically correct in certain contexts within Italian language, but without additional context it's difficult to determine if this specific sentence is completely accurate. In general, the grammatical structure appears to be correct for Italian. However, please note that as an assistant I don't have the ability to understand or speak languages other than English fluently, so my judgement on non-English sentences might not be 100% reliable.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian, it means "Edoardo took the history book from the bookshelf".
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and appears to be grammatically correct. In English, it would translate to "Leonardo takes the book from the library room."
0	The sentence "Gabriele mette le casse sul ripiano del montacarichi." appears to be written in Italian. Since I am designed to assist with English language tasks, I cannot accurately determine if it's grammatically correct according to English grammar rules. However, based on general grammatical principles, some possible corrections could be: - "Gabriel puts the boxes on the platform of the lift." (If we assume that "montacarichi" means "lift")
0	The sentence "Dove hai messo le foto di Francesco?" appears to be written in Italian, which I do not evaluate. However, based on general grammar principles, it seems that there might be a missing question mark at the end of the sentence. A proper question in English would be: "Where did you put Francesco's photos?"
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written Italian sentence that means "The key is in the hole."

0	The sentence "Dal giardino Leonardo ha piantato fiori al garage." seems to be in Italian. A corrected version in English would be: "Leonardo planted flowers from the garden to the garage." However, without context it's unclear what exactly should be conveyed, so please adjust as needed.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct. In English, "La scala poggia contro il muro" translates to "The ladder leans against the wall."

1	The sentence is already correct. It's an Italian sentence that means "Francesco locked Juliet in the room."
0	The correct form of the sentence in English would be "Gabriele closed the money." However, even though I provided you with the corrected version, it's important to note that the original Italian sentence "Gabriele chiuse il denaro" contains an error. In Italian, when referring to money as a whole, one should use the term "il denaro," but if you want to specify physical cash or coins, then the plural form "i soldi" should be used instead. Therefore, the correct Italian sentence based on context could either be "Gabriele ha chiuso il denaro" (meaning Gabriele closed the concept of money, such as closing a bank account), or "Gabriele ha chiuso i soldi" (meaning Gabriele put away or stored actual cash).
0	The sentence "Gabriele dette appoggio al libro." appears to be in Italian, while I am designed to primarily evaluate English sentences for grammaticality. In Italian, it seems that the sentence could be grammatically correct depending on context; however, without proper context, it's difficult to say with certainty. Nonetheless, since you requested an evaluation based on English language rules, here is the corrected version of the sentence adapted to English: Gabriel lent support to the book.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Lorenzo caricò il camion." appears to be in Italian, which I cannot fully evaluate for grammatical correctness as my expertise lies primarily in English language. However, it does contain an accent mark on the letter 'o' that may cause issues when using standard Latin-based fonts without proper encoding support. This might lead to display inconsistencies but doesn't necessarily mean the sentence itself is grammatically incorrect in Italian.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Riccardo stipò l'armadio con i vestiti." is only partially correct because it follows Italian grammar rules but may not be understood by all English speakers without additional context. A more universally understandable version would be: "Riccardo stuffed the closet with clothes."
1	The sentence is already correct. It's an Italian sentence meaning "Giulia's photograph and Lorenzo's one are stuck."
1	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The corrected sentence is, "Ho intenzione di vestirmi da sposa." The original sentence contains a grammatical error where the reflexive pronoun "mi" does not agree with the subject "io". It should be omitted since the verb "vestire" can be intransitive here.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is because it's an Italian sentence that means "It was raining hard that morning." in English.
0	The correct word order for this sentence in Italian should be "Alessandro beve il vino." So, the corrected sentence is: "Alessandro beve il vino."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Andrea mangia un polpo." is only partially correct because it follows Italian grammar rules, but since English is the common language here, I assume you want an English translation which is "Andrea eats an octopus."
1	The sentence is already correct. Note: This sentence appears to be in Italian, and it seems grammatically correct for that language. It translates to "Tommaso eats this" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct. Comment: This sentence appears to be in Spanish and it seems grammatically correct for that language. It translates to "Sofia loves him" in English.
0	The sentence "L'artrosi ha paralizzato le ossa." is incorrect in English. A corrected version could be: "Arthritis has immobilized the bones."
0	The sentence "Maria vuole lo mangiare" would be grammatically correct in an informal context within Italian-speaking regions, but it may sound unnatural to native English speakers due to its lack of clarity regarding the object being eaten. A more clear and natural way to express the same idea in English would be "Maria wants to eat it."
1	The sentence is already correct. (This sentence appears to be in Italian, with "Lorenzo" as the subject that is doing the action of admiring ("ammira") someone named "Alice". In Italian grammar, it's common for the verb to come before the object, which explains why "Alice" comes after "ammira". So there doesn't seem to be any issue with the grammatical structure of this sentence.)
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Riccardo la admira." since you used an Italian sentence as input, but with Spanish verb conjugation.
1	The sentence is already correct. It is grammatically correct Italian.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's an Italian sentence that means "Maria jumps on the bed."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence. It means "Edoardo wants coffee right away."
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Il succcesso è quello che Tommaso desidera" which translates to "Success is what Thomas desires". The original sentence contains some grammatical errors in Italian such as missing articles and wrong verb conjugation.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it means "Leonardo aims for the presidency."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "I denti di Emma battono dal freddo" seems to be in Italian and does not follow proper grammar rules for that language. A corrected version could be "Denti di Emma battono dal freddo," which means "Emma's teeth chatter from the cold." However, without additional context, it's unclear who "Emma" refers to, so a more complete correction would depend on the intended meaning of the original sentence.
0	The sentence "Alessandro le adora che hanno gambe lunghe le donne." appears to be in Italian. A corrected version in English would be: "Alessandro loves that women have long legs."
0	The sentence "Andrea ne adora le amiche di Emma." is in Italian. Its English translation, "Andrea loves Emma's friends," is grammatically correct. However, if you want the exact same sentence in proper form for an Italian course, it would be "Andrea non le adora alle amiche di Emma" where "non" indicates negation as I don't have enough context regarding your requirement but assuming from the initial request that you need a grammatically correct version of the original sentence which had some minor errors in terms of word order and article usage.
0	The sentence "Gabriele mangia un gelato." would be considered grammatically correct in Italian, but it is not understandable without knowledge of that language. In English, an acceptable translation might be "Gabrielle eats an ice cream," which contains proper subject-verb agreement and follows standard English syntax rules.
0	The sentence "Riccardo promette a Riccardo che verrà" is incorrect because it contains repetition of the same proper name. A corrected version could be "Riccardo promises that he will come."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence that means "Sofia eats octopus."
0	The sentence "La tolleranza ne esula dai suoi doveri" seems to be in Italian. I will assume you want me to check it for grammaticality in English instead. Here's the corrected version of the sentence translated into English: "Tolerance does not exclude its duties."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This sentence appears to be in Italian and it follows proper grammar rules for that language. In English, "Andrea thinks about Paola" would be an accurate translation of its meaning.
0	The sentence "Sofia accompagna Maria in Cina." is not correct as it uses Italian instead of English. A corrected version would be: "Sophia accompanies Maria to China."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Beatrice involuntarily absorbs Francesco" would be the corrected version in English. However, the original sentence provided seems grammatically correct in Italian, but with a different meaning than the intended one in English. In Italian, it means "Beatrice unconsciously takes in Francesco," which may not have been the intended meaning. So, for an accurate comparison, I'm providing the corrected English version based on the context you likely intended.
0	The sentence "Lorenzo distribuisce mattone." is incorrect because it lacks proper agreement between the subject ("Lorenzo") and the verb ("distribuisce"). A more appropriate form would be "Lorenzo distribuisce i mattoni" in Italian, which means "Lorenzo distributes bricks/blocks".
0	The sentence "Che Riccardo dipinga è bello." seems to be in Italian. A possible corrected version of it in English would be: "That Richard paints is beautiful." However, without context, it's hard to say for sure what the intended meaning is supposed to be, so I cannot guarantee that my suggested correction captures the original intent.
0	The sentence "Sofia passeggia per Venezia." appears to be in Italian, not English. A possible corrected version of the sentence in English could be "Sophia walks in Venice.", assuming that's what it intended to convey.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian that means "Maria collects pebbles."
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Giulia legge un libro." which means "Giulia reads a book" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Maria traveste Alice" is incorrect because "travesti" is not a standard English verb; it seems that you meant to use an English verb in its place. Also, subject-verb agreement is necessary for grammatical correctness, so we would need to know if "Maria" and "Alice" are singular or plural entities to ensure proper verb conjugation.
1	The sentence is already correct. This appears to be a grammatical sentence in Italian, meaning "Emma humiliates Edward."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian. It means "The lightning struck on Andrea's head."
0	The sentence "Fa neve" is not grammatically correct in English. A possible correction could be "It is snowing."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The mayo didn't take well. (If you want an English translation of your original Italian sentence.) Comment: In English, we would say "The mayo didn't take" instead of "La maionese non ha preso bene."
1	The sentence is already correct. This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria smiles at Giulia" in English.
0	The correct form would be "Quel vestito non le sta bene ad Alice." in Italian as it translates to "That dress doesn't suit Alice" which maintains the original intended meaning while being grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence that means "The company's capital amounts to many billions."
1	The sentence is already correct. It is a correctly written Italian sentence, which means "A star shines in the sky."

1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it means "A star twinkles in the sky."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence that means "Maria's dress sparkles with a stunning diamond."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is an Italian sentence that means "Beatrice burns with passion" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is an Italian sentence that means "Paola was shining with emotion" in English. It appears to be grammatically correct in Italian.
0	The sentence "Quell'idea si fa chiara nel suo animo." appears to be in Italian, while I am designed to evaluate English sentences only. Therefore, it would not be fair for me to provide a judgment on its grammaticality without understanding the language. However, based on general linguistic principles, it seems that some parts of speech might be missing or misplaced which could make the sentence ungrammatical in standard Italian.
0	The correct form of the sentence in English would be "Gabriele will reply to you." The original sentence in Italian seems to have some issues with word order and tense.
1	The sentence is already correct. This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Riccardo arrives home" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's an Italian sentence that means "The staircase goes down to the cellar."
0	The path leads us there. (The original sentence "Il sentiero ci arriva" in Italian translates to "The path leads us" but it's not written in English as provided.)
1	The sentence is already correct. This is an Italian sentence that appears to be grammatically correct.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Ella lotta su questo punto" in Italian, as "Ella" means "she". Also, it's important to note that the sentence structure and grammar rules can vary depending on the context, so make sure to consult with an expert for more specific cases.
0	The sentence "Riccardo taglia il pane a fetta." appears to be in Italian. Since I am only able to assess grammaticality with respect to English, I cannot determine whether it's grammatically correct or not. However, for an English translation of this sentence, we have: "Riccardo cuts the bread into slices," which is grammatically correct in English.
0	The sentence "Riccardo gli vie il volto." is incorrect in English as it stands. A more appropriate formulation could be "Riccardo saw his face," depending on context.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian that means "The tailor made a linen suit."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence.
0	The sentence "Leonardo avait amassé des paquets au bas de la bibliothèque." would be grammatically correct in French, but the original sentence "Leonardo había amontonado paquetes al lado inferior del librería" is the corrected version in Italian.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is because "Leonardo avait amassé contre le mur" appears to be a correctly structured sentence in French, with the subject "Leonardo", the auxiliary verb "avait" indicating past tense, and the direct object "le mur". However, I must clarify that my expertise lies primarily in English language and grammar, so I cannot guarantee perfect accuracy for other languages.
0	The sentence "Lorenzo ci hatte ammassato pacchetti" is incorrect because it uses an Italian word ("aveva") with German conjugation rules for the past tense of "hatten." A corrected version in Italian could be "Lorenzo ce l'aveva ammucchiati," which means something similar to "Lorenzo had piled them up for us."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian that means "The miser accumulates wealth."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct sentence in Italian that means "Leonardo is important to us."
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian language and it means "The Sergeant distributes the soldiers."
0	The sentence "Sofia separò il lavoro in due parti distinte." is not grammatically correct in English. A corrected version could be "Sofia divided the work into two distinct parts," assuming we want to maintain the original meaning as much as possible.

1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Riccardo forgia l'acciaio." appears to be in Italian and does not follow standard English grammar rules. A possible corrected version of the sentence in English could be: "Riccardo forges steel."
0	The sentence "Sofia cucina il pollo al limone." appears to be in Italian, which I cannot fully evaluate for grammatical correctness as it's outside of my expertise in English language. However, based on general linguistic principles, there seems to be an issue with gender agreement between "cucina" (she cooks) and "il pollo" (the chicken), where masculine singular form does not agree with third person singular female subject. It would have been more appropriate to use "la pollo" since "-a" ending denotes feminine nouns in Italian.
0	The sentence "Le donne partoriscono i bambini." is incorrect in English. A corrected version could be "Women give birth to children."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian, it means "Paola turns sugar into candies."
1	The sentence is already correct. (Note: This appears to be Italian for "The government turns opponents into criminals." I am only evaluating its grammaticality within that language.)
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Alice ne travaillait sur Francesco." in French as it follows the grammar rules correctly for past tense verb conjugation with a reflexive pronoun.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is an Italian sentence that means "Riccardo freed the dog." in English.
1	The sentence is already correct. It is grammatically correct in Italian.

1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Riccardo mise il tavolo di cappello." is incorrect because it doesn't make sense in Italian. A more appropriate translation of the English sentence "Riccardo put the hat on the table" would be "Riccardo pose il cappello sul tavolo".
0	The sentence "L'aviazione nemica bombardò napalm sulla città." should be "L'aviazione nemica bombarbà napalm sulla città." because in past tense of indicative mood for third person singular, "bombardare" becomes "bombarde". Also, there should be an accent on the last "a" in "napalm".
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Andrea beve il vino." as "imbeve" is not a recognized verb in Italian and "pane di vino" translates to bread of wine which does not make sense in English either.
0	The sentence "Raso rosso foderava i cuscini" would be grammatically correct in Italian; however, it is not understandable as-is because English speakers will likely not know that "raso rosso" means "red silk," "foderava" is the verb form meaning "stuffed" or "lined," and "cuscini" refers to cushions. Here's an example of how you could rephrase the same idea into acceptable English: The red silk lined the cushions.
1	The sentence is already correct. (This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct.)
0	The tourists are scattering litter on the lawn. (If you wanted to say "tourists are spreading out on the grass", it would be "I turisti si stendono sull'erba")
0	The sentence "Gabriele nutrì il figlio dell'idea di essere il più bravo ed intelligente di tutti." seems to contain some grammatical issues. A possible correction could be "Gabriele nutrì suo figlio con l'idea di essere il migliore e il più intelligente di tutti.", which translates to "Gabriele fed his son with the idea of being the best and the smartest of all."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is an Italian sentence that means "Riccardo freed the dog from the chains" in English. It appears to be grammatically correct as it stands.
0	The sentence "Alessandro scarica Giulia dalle proprie responsabilità." is incorrect in English as it stands. A corrected version could be "Alessandro relieves Giulia of her responsibilities" for proper grammar and syntax.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and appears to be grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "L'alchimista fa che l'oro derivi dal piombo." should be "L'alchimista fa sì che l'oro derivi dal piombo.", as "fa che" needs to change into "fa sì che".

0	The sentence "Tommaso fondeva l'argento con l'oro." is incorrect in English as it is written in Italian. A possible correct English version could be: "Tommaso melted silver with gold."
0	The sentence "Gabriele ci sostituisce il tubo catodico." appears to be in Italian, while my expertise is mainly focused on English grammar. However, without further context it's hard for me to definitively say if it's grammatically correct in Italian. In general, I can only provide feedback on the grammaticality of sentences written in English.
0	The sentence "Riccardo le sostituisce il tubo catodico." appears to be in Italian, while my expertise is mainly focused on English grammar. However, I can still confirm that it seems grammatically correct based on basic Italian language rules. But for more accurate evaluation of complex structures or idiomatic expressions, you might want to consult an expert in Italian linguistics.
0	The sentence "Tommaso alterna Beatrice con Paola" would be grammatically correct in certain contexts in Italian, but it may sound unnatural in English. A more natural way of expressing the same idea in English might be "Tommaso alternates between Beatrice and Paola."
0	The sentence "L'amore lega" is incorrect as it does not form a complete thought in English or Italian. A more appropriate sentence could be "L'amore unisce" which translates to "Love binds" in English.
0	The sentence "Gabriele dorme" would be grammatically correct in certain languages such as Italian, where it means "Gabriele sleeps." However, if you want to make sure that the sentence is acceptable in English, then it needs correction because "dorme" does not mean anything in English. A corrected version of the sentence could be: "Gabriele sleeps."
0	The sentence "Maria desidera un libro." is in a language other than English (Italian), so it's not grammatically correct for an English context. A grammatically correct English version would be: "Maria wants a book."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Leonardo tiene alla possibilità che lo promuovano" seems to be written in Italian with some grammatical errors. A possible correction could be "Leonardo ha la possibilità di essere promosso." This means "Leonardo has the possibility of being promoted" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct sentence would be "Maria si bagna (**she bathes**) because she wants everything to function perfectly." In your original sentence, "bada" is not a correctly conjugated form of any Italian verb that would make sense in context. Also, there's a missing pronoun "si", which is necessary for the reflexive verb "bagna".
0	The sentence "Edoardo approva che Maria parta." is in Italian. A corrected version in English would be: "Edoardo approves that Maria leaves."
0	The correct form of the sentence in English would be "Emma doubts that Alice is leaving." In Italian, it should be "Emma dubita che Alice stia partendo."
0	The sentence "Che Lorenzo viaggi angoscia Tommaso" is incorrect in English; it appears to be written in Italian with an incorrect word order for expressing "Lorenzo's travel makes Tommaso anxious." A more appropriate translation would be "Il viaggio di Lorenzo angoscia Tommaso".
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Riccardo lo approva questa idea." which means "Riccardo approves this idea". In your original sentence, "ciò" doesn't fit in the context as it translates to "that", so I replaced it with "questa" meaning "this".
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Edoardo approva il fatto che Maria canti." In Italian, when using an indirect object pronoun such as "lo" before a verb, you typically drop the article that comes before the verb. So in this case, it's incorrect to say "lo approva", instead just use "approva".
0	You want Sophia to come. (This is the corrected version of the original sentence as it contained spelling errors.)
0	The sentence "Riccardo va al fumo" is incorrect because in Italian, "fumo" means smoke, so it cannot be used as a destination for someone to go to. A more appropriate sentence could be "Riccardo va al negozio." which translates to "Riccardo goes to the shop".
0	The sentence "Alice brama di tornare" would be grammatically correct in Italian; however, it contains errors when evaluated against English grammar rules. A corrected version of the sentence in English could be: "Alice longs to return."
0	The corrected sentence would be "Andrea encourages Maria to get married." or "Andrea incoraggia Maria a sposarsi." In the original sentence, there's an incorrect usage of "a" before "che", which needs to be removed for proper Italian grammar.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Andare al cinema infiamma Sofia." seems to be in Italian. In English, it would translate to something like "Going to the movies inflames Sophia," which is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate English translation could be "Taking Sophia to the movies excites her" or "Sophia gets excited about going to the cinema".
0	The sentence "La colpisce che Riccardo rida." appears to be written in Italian. If you'd like me to evaluate an English sentence for grammatical correctness, please provide one. However, I can tell you that in standard Italian, this sentence seems grammatically acceptable with a proper context where it fits naturally.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Leonardo allieta Leonardo perché Maria ride." seems to be in Italian. In English, it would translate to "Leonardo delights Leonard because Mary laughs," which is grammatically incorrect. A possible grammatically correct English version of the original Italian sentence could be "Leonardo amuses himself because Maria is laughing."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence. It means "It comforts me that Julia speaks this way."
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it appears to be grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it seems grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "Di vedere i marziani accadde a Paola." seems to be written in Italian. In English, it would translate to something like "To see the martians happened to Paola," which doesn't make sense in English context. A more appropriate sentence could be "Paola saw martians."
0	The sentence "Aver vinto al lotto splendeva nel suo sguardo." seems to be written in Italian, but for English language grammar checking purposes, it's considered incorrect as it stands. In English, the corrected version of the sentence could be something like "Having won the lottery shone in her gaze," although the literal translation may not convey the intended meaning perfectly.
0	The sentence "Di aver vinto al lotto splendeva nel suo sguardo." does not appear to be grammatically correct in standard Italian. A possible correction could be: "Aver vinto al lotto faceva brillare i suoi occhi." which means "Winning the lottery made his eyes shine."
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Bisogna che noi fuggiAMO." since "trattare" doesn't fit in this context and it requires an object. Also, the verb conjugation needs to agree with the subject which is "noi".
0	The sentence "Si tratta di fuggire." would be considered grammatically correct in Italian; however, it may not make sense without additional context as it translates to "It's about escaping" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct. It is grammatically correct Italian.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and means "Gabriele loves to stroke Andrea".
1	The sentence is already correct. This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct. It translates to "Andrea intends to marry Alice" in English.
0	The sentence "Riccardo evita guardare la televisione" is incorrect. A corrected version could be "Riccardo evita di guardare la televisione", which means "Riccardo avoids watching TV".
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Paola ritiene che si parta sia carino." This means that Paola thinks that leaving is nice. In Italian, when using "si" as a substitute for a subject pronoun in compound tenses, you need to use "sia" instead of just "è" to agree with it.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Lorenzo riteneva **che** Alice fosse Paola." The conjunction "che" is needed after "riteneva" for the sentence to be grammatically correct in Italian.
0	The sentence "Beatrice lo giudica che Maria ha troppi amanti." is incorrect in English, but it may be grammatically correct in another language such as Italian. In English, the correct form would be: "Beatrice judges that Maria has too many lovers."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct sentence in Italian. It means "Sofia judges that Mary has too many lovers."
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence. It translates to "Giulia clearly judges that Maria is beautiful."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian. It means "Leonardo thinks that his father drinks too much."
0	The sentence "Io penso qualcosa di te." is in Italian. A corrected version in English would be: "I think something of you.", but it still sounds unusual in English. If you want to say "I'm thinking about you" in English, just say "Sto pensando a te."
0	The sentence "Io, di te, penso che ami il tartufo." appears to be written in Italian, which I assume you wanted me to check for grammatical correctness. In that case, it's important to note that I can only assess the English language sentences. However, even in Italian, there seems to be an issue with word order and possibly missing punctuation marks. A more natural way of expressing this idea might be "Di te, io penso che ami il tartufo." but without context, it's hard to say for sure.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence that means "Emma gets something from you."
0	The sentence "Alice lavora a cacciare Maria" is incorrect because it violates subject-verb agreement in Italian. In Italian, verbs must agree with their subjects in number and gender. Here, "lavora", which means "works", does not agree with its plural subject "Alice". Also, the verb "cacciare" requires an object, but there isn't one provided. A possible correction could be "Alice e Maria lavorano insieme." (meaning "Alice and Maria work together.")
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Maria ci aspira" would be grammatically correct in certain contexts in Italian, but without additional context it's difficult for me to say for sure. However, one issue with the sentence as written is that there is no punctuation at the end of the sentence, which is generally required in written English. Additionally, depending on the intended meaning of the sentence, some rephrasing might be necessary for clarity when translating to English. For example, a possible English translation could be "Maria inspires us," assuming that "ci" refers to "us." But again, more context would be needed to make a definitive assessment.
1	The sentence "Maria ci si aggrappa" is already correct.
0	The sentence "Paola mira a che il futuro sia felice." seems to be written in Italian. If you want me to check its grammaticality in Italian, I'm afraid that's beyond my capabilities as I am designed primarily to understand and generate English text. However, if you would like to translate it into English for checking, please provide the English translation.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Riccardo lo pensa Tommaso" is incorrect because it violates word order rules in English. In English, we would say "Tommaso thinks about Riccardo."
0	The sentence "Paola acconsente a che la leghino" is incorrect because it is in mixed tense and has an unclear pronoun reference. A corrected version could be "Paola accetta di essere letta," which means "Paola agrees to being read."
0	The corrected sentence would be "Alice smiles at the fact that she cried." If you intended to say something different, please provide the intended meaning so I can give a more accurate correction.
1	The sentence is already correct. (Note: I am assuming that you provided an Italian sentence for evaluation since it contains non-English words. If my assumption is incorrect, please let me know.)
0	The corrected sentence would be "Da queste analisi risulta la nostra decisione di partire." This means "Based on this analysis, our decision to leave emerges" in English. I had to make some assumptions about what you intended for the original Italian sentence to mean because it wasn't grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence that translates to "Coughing depends on having smoked too much."
0	The sentence "Leonardo chiarisce che non è colpa sua a Paola." seems to be written in Italian. In English, it could be translated as "Leonardo clarifies that it's not his fault to Paola.", which is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way to express this idea in English would be "Leonardo clarifies that it's not his fault to Paolo." or "Leonardo clarifies to Paolo that it's not his fault."
0	The sentence "Andrea fischia a Maria che ha fame." is in Italian and does not make sense when directly translated to English ("Andrea whistles at Maria who is hungry"). A corrected version of this sentence would be grammatically correct if it were written in proper context within an Italian text.
0	The corrected sentence is "Andrea accentuerà sur Édouard s'il partira ou non." The original sentence contains spelling errors in the names "accennerà" which should be "accentuera", "Edoardo" which should be "Édouard" and "partirà" which should be "partira". Additionally, it uses English grammar instead of French grammar for the conditional clause.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence.
1	The sentence is already correct. This appears to be a grammatically correct sentence in Italian.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it seems grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Emma ne avvisa Alessandro" appears to be in Italian and contains a word that seems misspelled or misused. In standard Italian, it should be "Emma lo avvisa Alessandro" where "lo" is used as a direct object pronoun referring to "avvisare".
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Riccardo si è ritirato dal viaggio." The original sentence contains two errors: it uses 'esime' instead of 'si è ritirato', which means 'has withdrawn'; and it places 'dal viaggio' at the end when it should come right after the verb.
0	The sentence "Il sindaco esenta i poveri dal pagare il bus." seems to be in Italian, while I am designed to evaluate English sentences only. However, without knowing the intended meaning of the sentence, it's difficult for me to say with certainty whether there are any grammatical errors. Nonetheless, here are some possible issues that could arise when translating the sentence back into English: "The mayor exempts the poor from paying the bus." In English, we would typically use an expression such as "paying for" rather than just "paying," so the corrected sentence might read: "The mayor exempts the poor from paying for the bus."
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it means "Maria agrees with Leonardo so that the program is realized."
0	The correct form of the sentence in English would be "Alice discusses leaving with Julia." The original sentence contains a spelling error for the verb "discorrere" which should be "discutere".
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Leonardo lo induce a comer." since you have provided an Italian sentence but with Spanish words for eating ("mangiare" in Italian is "comer" in Spanish).
0	The sentence "Edoardo osa mangiare" is incorrect because it lacks proper subject-verb agreement in English. A corrected version could be "Edoardo dares to eat."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. It is in Italian and it seems grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "Tommaso suole il pasto" is incorrect because it uses the Italian word for "usually" (suole) instead of the Italian word for "eats" (mangia), and also uses the wrong gender article for "pasto". A corrected version would be "Tommaso mangia la pasta."
1	The sentence is already correct. This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct. In English, "Riccardo must eat it" would be an accurate translation.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Gabriele lo utilizza per mangiarlo" which means "Gabriele uses it to eat it." in English. The original sentence contained an error as "mangiarlo" cannot directly follow the subject "Gabriele".
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Andrea sells in camera." However, I suspect that you meant to say "Andrea sells cameras," which would also be grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Beatrice assembla un computer." is not correct in English. A corrected version could be "Beatrice assembles a computer.", assuming that the context requires it to be in present tense.
1	The sentence is already correct. Comment: This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence that means "The movie is by Scorsese."
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it means "Paola works."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct form of the sentence in English would be "Many of them read the newspaper." In Italian, the corrected sentence is "Molti di loro leggono il giornale.", as the pronoun "loro" needs to agree with the verb conjugation "leggono".
0	Quelques musées ont été conçus par un architecte. (French translation of "Some museums were designed by an architect") Explanation: The original sentence contains an error in Italian language where the definite article "l'" is missing before "architetto". It would be correct as follows: Quell'alcuni musei sono stati progettati da **l**'architetto.
1	The sentence is already correct. (This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct.)
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Quello architetto ha progettato alcuni musei." In your original sentence, "quell'" needs to agree with its noun in gender and number, so it should be "quello" because "architetto" is masculine singular. Also, there shouldn't be an apostrophe after "quell".
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and appears to be grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it means "Maria will be touched by that movie."
0	The sentence "Che tu sia partita rallegra Beatrice." seems to be in Italian. Its English translation would be something like "That you have left cheers up Beatrice.", which contains a grammatical error as it requires an additional auxiliary verb for tense consistency in the main clause ("cheers" cannot be used as a finite verb here). A possible correction could be: "The fact that you have left makes Beatrice happy."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence that means "Gabriele is Paola's husband."
1	The sentence is already correct. It's grammatically correct in Italian and it means "Beatrice is with Lorenzo."
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Tommaso obbedisce a Maria." as "di" indicates possession in Italian while "a" is used for indicating that someone is the object of an action.
0	The sentence "Andrea confronts Leonardo with Andrea" is incorrect because it uses the same name twice in a way that doesn't make sense in English. A corrected version could be "Andrea confronts Leonardo."
1	The sentence is already correct. Comment: This sentence appears to be in Italian, but as per your instruction I am only responsible for checking its grammaticality within that language context. Here, "Maria fotografa Paola" translates to "Mary photographs Paula". It seems to follow all the necessary subject-verb-object structure of an Italian sentence. Hence it's grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian that means "Lorenzo has been eager."
0	The sentence "Tua sorella guarda il gelato." should be "Tua sorella sta guardando il gelato." in English it means "Your sister is watching ice cream" which does not make sense so I assume you want to say "Your sister is looking at the ice cream" in Italian.
0	The sentence "Tua sorella guarda il CD" is incorrect because it uses the wrong form of "the." In Italian, you would say "La sorella" instead of "Tua sorella". Also, "il CD" can be changed to just "CD", since we've switched from using an article with "sorella". So the corrected sentence is: "La sorella guarda il CD" or more correctly: "La sorella guarda il CD."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is because it is grammatically correct in Italian, which appears to be the language of the sentence. In English, however, the translation would be "Sofia cut off the buffalo's head," which is also grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "Sofia ha tagliato le teste ai tori." is in Italian and it does not make sense in English. A possible English equivalent could be "Sofia cut off the bulls' heads.", assuming contextual information that makes such an action sensible and justifiable.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is an Italian sentence that means "The boys would cut the rope" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence. It means "It's the bull that Maria took by the horns and not the buffalo."
0	The sentence "Maria stende il bucato." is in a language other than English (Italian), so it's difficult for me to determine its grammaticality without translating it first. In English, an equivalent sentence could be "Maria hangs out the laundry" which is grammatically correct. However, I cannot give a definitive judgment on the original Italian sentence as it may have different grammar rules compared to English.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian that means "My friend barks."
1	The sentence is already correct. This sentence, "Riccardo ulula," appears to be in Latin and means something like "Riccardo howls." It's grammatically valid within its own linguistic context.
0	The sentence "Gabriele dormì" would be grammatically correct in certain languages such as Italian, where it means "Gabriele slept." However, since no language has been specified for this exercise, I will assume you want an answer in English. In that case, the grammatically correct form of the sentence could be: "Gabriele slept."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's grammatically correct in Italian.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian, it means "Leonardo has dissected the old elm" in English.

1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian, and it means "Andrea has become skillful."
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence.
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Che tu te ne vada dispiace a Beatrice." The original sentence contains some errors in verb conjugation and word order.
0	The children have trampled the flower beds. (The sentence you provided "I bambini hanno calpestato le aiuole" is in Italian, so it's grammatically incorrect when considered as an English sentence.)
0	The children burped out lava. (The original sentence "I bambini eruttarono lava" in English would be "The children burped out lava", but it seems that there's a mistake with the subject-verb agreement as "bambini" is plural so we use "burped" instead of "bambino" which means child in singular form.)
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Quell'uomo ne ha fotografato" is incorrect because it seems to be missing additional context in order for its grammaticality to be determined. Additionally, there might be an omitted word such as "one" after "ne". A more complete version of the sentence could be something like "Quel uomo ne ha fotografato uno", which means "That man photographed one."
1	The sentence is already correct. It is grammatically correct in Italian.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's an Italian sentence that means "Paola's face is caressed" in English.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian, meaning "Edoardo broke Maria's arm."
0	The sentence "Leonardo ha paralizzato il braccio a Maria." would be grammatically correct in certain contexts in Italian, but it translates to "Leonardo has paralyzed Maria's arm" in English, which seems odd without additional context due to its potential implications. If that is the intended meaning, then the grammar is correct; otherwise, you may want to rephrase for clarity.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence. It means "The workers paved the road" in English.
0	The sentence "Paola elencò l'invitato" is in Italian and does not make sense in English. A possible correct English version could be "Paola listed the guest."
0	The correct sentence would be "Alice ha messo gli abiti nell'armadio." The original sentence had an error in the object pronoun agreement with the noun it refers to; "ciò" does not agree with "vestiti".
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Il libro passa da Maria a Mario." would be grammatically correct as it distinguishes between the two different people named Maria and Mario. If both individuals referred to in your sentence are meant to be the same person, then you could say "Il libro ritorna a Maria" ("the book returns to Maria") instead.
0	The English translation of your sentence "Maria dà un libro a Paola" would be "Maria gives a book to Paola". However, in English we don't put the verb before the subject when it's in present tense, unless using auxiliary verbs for questions or negations. So, a more natural way to say it would be: "Maria gives Paola a book."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian, meaning "Francesco appoints Gabriele as his representative."
0	The sentence "Sofia delega Maria come sua rappresentante" is incorrect in Italian. A possible correction could be "Sofia nomina Maria sua rappresentante", which means "Sofia appoints Maria as her representative".
0	The correct form of the sentence would be "Lorenzo abita là e questo succede a Roma." The original sentence uses "ciò" which means "this", but it's unclear what "this" refers to in the context. Also, "ciò" cannot be used as an adverb meaning "there". Therefore, I replaced "ciò" with "là" which also means "there".
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Sofia fuma una bionda." is not grammatically correct in English. A corrected version could be "Sofia smokes a blonde cigarette."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written sentence in Italian that means "Edoardo spread the pate on the bread."
1	The sentence is already correct. It is grammatically correct in Italian.
0	The sentence "Le bombe piovevano su di noi" would be grammatically correct in Italian; however, it is not understandable as it is written in another language than English. Here's an approximate translation in English: "The bombs were raining down on us."
0	The corrected sentence is "I matrimoni misti FUNZIONANO in modo PERFETTO." In Italian, nouns, adjectives, and past participles must agree in number and gender with the subject they refer to. Therefore, all of these words need to be written in their plural form ("matrimoni", "perfetto") since the subject "i matrimoni" is plural.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and means "your idea is equivalent to mine."
1	The sentence is already correct. Comment: This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct. "La tua idea" means "your idea", and "e la mia" means "and mine". So, together, "la tua idea e la mia" translates to "your idea and mine", which implies that they are equivalent.
1	The sentence is already correct. (The sentence "Edoardo gira per la città." appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo walks around the city.")
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it means "Giulia returns from Milan to Naples."
1	The sentence is already correct. Explanation: "Lorenzo controlla Paola" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo checks Paola". Each word is correctly spelled, and the verb form agrees with the subject.
0	The sentence "Maria acconsente a che la figlia esca con quel ragazzo." is incorrect in English. A corrected version could be "Maria agrees that her daughter can go out with that boy.", assuming it's what you intended to convey.
0	The sentence "Alice bada Maria" is incorrect. A grammatically correct version could be "Alice hugged Maria."
0	The sentence "Paola dubita di te." appears to be in Italian and does not follow standard English grammar rules. A correct English version of the sentence could be "Paola doubts you."
0	The sentence "Maria desidera che tu parta." is in Italian. A corrected version in English would be: "Maria wants you to leave."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence. It means "Andrea likes that Julius is always traveling."

1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian, but it appears to be grammatically correct.

1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. The sentence "La partenza apporta un beneficio a tutti" is in Italian and it translates to "The departure brings a benefit to all". It appears to be grammatically correct in its original language with no spelling errors or awkward phrasing.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Alice mette in agitazione Tommaso." appears to be written in Italian. For English grammar checking, please provide an English sentence.
0	The sentence "Andrea lascia a Leonardo pieni poteri" would be grammatically correct in Italian, but since it's provided as is, it's not appropriate for me to alter it. However, if you translate it to English, it becomes "Andrea leaves full powers to Leonardo," which may not be what you intended due to changes in syntax when translating between languages. Could you please clarify if you want an English translation that maintains the original sentence structure?
0	The sentence "Il piatto piange" is incorrect in English as it stands. A corrected version of the sentence could be provided if I knew what you intended for it to express. However, without further context, I cannot provide an accurate correction. My apologies for any inconvenience.
0	The sentence "Mi girano le scatole." is incorrect in English as it stands. A corrected version could be "My boxes are turning," but I suspect that's not what you meant since this sounds unusual even in Italian. If you intended to say something else, please rephrase it.
0	The sentence "Alice si è attaccata a un capello." seems to be in Italian and it's hard for me to evaluate its grammaticality without knowing that language well. However, assuming you wanted an English equivalent of the same meaning, it would translate to "Alice attached herself to a hair," which does seem grammatically odd as we don't usually say someone has attached themselves to a single hair. Maybe something else was intended?
1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct. It's in Italian and it means "Sofia and Riccardo speak the same language."
0	The sentence "Avere fegato" does not seem to be grammatically correct in standard Italian. If you're looking for the verb "have" and the word "liver", it would be "Avere il fegato".
0	The correct form of the sentence should be "Avere le paure" which means "to have fears" in English.
0	The sentence "Avere sulle scatole" does not seem to be grammatically correct in Italian. If you intended to say "I have boxes", it would be "Ho le scatole".
0	The sentence "Essere in un ventre di vacca" is incorrect as it does not follow standard English grammar rules. A corrected version could be "Being inside a cow's womb," assuming we want to convey that meaning with proper English syntax.

1	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Beatrice le scappa a comprare" does not make sense in English. A corrected version could be "Beatrice has to go buy something." If this is meant to be in Italian, it would still need an object for "comprare" so I cannot determine its accuracy without context.

1	The sentence is already correct.

0	The conversation that the two boys made, Paola criticized. Explanation: In English, we don't say "the two boys made a conversation". Instead, we can say "the two boys had/started/engaged in a conversation" or simply "the two boys talked". Additionally, the criticism by Paola refers to the conversation itself, so it would be more appropriate to place her action before the mention of the conversation.
1	The sentence is already correct.

0	The correct form would be "Era felice di questo." in English, it means "He/She was happy about that."

0	The sentence "Maria ha fatto irretire Leonardo" would be grammatically correct in certain contexts in Italian, but without additional context it's difficult to say for sure.

For example, one possible grammatically correct sentence could be "Maria ha affaticato molto Leonardo," which means "Maria tired out Leo very much."

If you wanted to express that Emma feels nervous in English, a correct version could be "Emma feels nervous."
1	The sentence is already correct. This is a correctly written Italian sentence.
0	The sentence "Sofia ha i nervi a fior di pelle." appears to be in Italian, while my expertise is mainly focused on English grammar. However, without knowing the context, it's difficult for me to definitively say that this sentence is grammatically correct or not in its original language. Nonetheless, I can analyze some elements of the sentence from an English perspective. In terms of structure, there seems to be a subject ("Sofia"), verb ("ha"), and object ("nervi"). This basic structure aligns with proper sentence formation rules. Nevertheless, as a non-Italian speaker, I cannot provide a conclusive judgment regarding its grammaticality within the original language.

1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct Italian sentence that means "Paola is in a state of fear."

0	The sentence "Maria levò il capo" is in a language other than English (Italian), so it cannot be classified as grammatically correct or incorrect based on English grammar rules. If we assume you meant for this sentence to be in English, then an acceptable translation would be "Maria lifted her head."
0	The sentence "Maria rizzò il capo" would be grammatically correct in certain languages, such as Italian, where it means "Maria raised her head." However, if you're looking for an English equivalent that maintains the original meaning, a corrected version could be: "Maria lifted her head."

0	The sentence "Andrea prese cappello." would be grammatically correct in certain contexts, but it depends on what language you're using. If you're speaking Italian, for example, this could mean "Andrew took a hat" which is grammatically correct. However, without additional context I cannot assume the intended language; therefore, I am assuming English. In that case, if we translate the words directly from Italian to English, it becomes "Andrew took hat", which is not grammatically correct in English because there needs to be an article ("a" or "the") before "hat". So the corrected version of the sentence in English would be "Andrew took a hat" or "Andrew took the hat", depending on the specific meaning you want to convey.

0	The sentence "Beatrice prese fischi per fiaschi" is in Italian and translates to "Beatrice took fools for jugs." This sentence has proper grammar in Italian but may be considered ungrammatical or confusing depending on the context in which it's used in an English conversation. If you want to convey its meaning in proper English, consider using something along these lines: "Beatrice pursued futile efforts," "Beatrice chased after empty promises," or simply "Beatrice failed miserably."
0	The sentence "Tommaso butta olio sul fuoco." is in a language other than English (Italian), so it cannot be evaluated for grammatical correctness based on English grammar rules. If we were to evaluate it based on Italian grammar rules, then it would be considered grammatically correct.

A possible corrected version could be: "That Andrea called caused the fact that Giulia returned." However, it's worth noting that the original sentence appears to follow Italian grammar rules, with "che" being used as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause. In English, we would typically use "that" instead of "che," but dropping "che" altogether from the translation still conveys the intended meaning.

1	The sentence is already correct. This is a grammatically correct sentence in Italian, which means "Emma is distressed."

0	The sentence "Alessandro corre l'asina" would be more grammatically correct as "Alessandro correrebbe **con** l'asina."

If "asina" is meant to refer to something else entirely, then please let me know so I can adjust my response accordingly!

However, without additional context, I can't say for sure if it's appropriate in an English conversation or writing. A direct translation of this sentence into English would be "Maria collects love ticket(s)," which doesn't seem to make sense in most contexts. If you meant something different in English, please let me know!

0	The sentence "Andare a monte" does not seem to be grammatically correct in English. If you meant it as an Italian phrase, then it means "to go uphill". In English, a possible grammatically correct sentence could be "Let's head up the mountain."
0	The sentence "Essere all'indice" seems to be in Italian and it does not make sense as it stands alone without additional context. However, based on its form, it appears that there may be some grammatical issues with the sentence. For instance, "essere" means "to be" in English, but in this context, it doesn't seem to be used correctly. Additionally, "all'indice" could mean "at the index," which still requires more information to complete the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, I would recommend revising the sentence for clarity and proper syntax.
0	The sentence "Mettere all'indice" is incorrect in English. A corrected version could be "Point to the index finger," assuming that's what was intended by "all'indice".

0	The sentence "Che Leonardo ritorni piace a Maria." is incorrect in standard Italian. It seems that there's an attempt at forming a question with "che" but it doesn't make sense as it stands now. A possible correction could be "A Leondaro piace tornare?", which means "Does Leonardo like to return?" in English.
0	The sentence "Sofia corre a mangiare" would be grammatically correct in certain contexts in Italian, but it does not form a complete thought in English. A more appropriate translation of "Sofia runs to eat" may be necessary for clarity in an English conversation.

0	The corrected sentence is "Tutti bevono l'amaro." The word "il" needs to agree with the gender of "amaro," which is masculine in this case, so we change it from "il" to "l'".
1	The sentence is already correct. This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct to me as a non-native speaker. A more precise judgement would require native level proficiency in Italian.

0	The sentence "Maria dà sepoltura al padre sotto un albero." appears to be written in Italian, so I will assume you want me to evaluate its grammaticality in that language. Unfortunately, I do not have the capability to assess the grammaticality of sentences in languages other than English. However, based on general linguistic principles, it seems that there might be an agreement issue between the subject ("Maria") and the verb form ("dà"). In standard Italian, the present indicative conjugation for the third person singular would be "da" rather than "dà". Therefore, the corrected sentence could be: "Maria da sepoltura al padre sotto un albero.", assuming all other elements in the sentence are used correctly according to their context.
