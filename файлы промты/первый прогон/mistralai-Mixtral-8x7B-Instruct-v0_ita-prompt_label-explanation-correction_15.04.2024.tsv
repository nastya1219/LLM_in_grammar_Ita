label	explanation	correction
0	The verb "volere" requires the use of the infinitive form after it, so instead of "di salutare", you should say "salutare". Also, there is no need for "di" before the name "Giulia".	Voglio salutare Giulia.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and the verb "ho" agrees with the subject "Io". Also, the indirect object pronoun "le" is correctly used before the infinitive verb "salutare".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct, with the plural possessive adjective "mio" modifying the singular noun "lo." This construction implies that the speaker has more than one favorite thing and specifically chooses "la Divina Commedia" as their preferred item from among those things.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the subject "il mio treno preferito" requires a singular verb form, but instead the plural form "sono" is used. Also, it doesn't make sense to say that your favorite train is a literary work like "la Divina Commedia."	La frase non è corretta. Si dovrebbe dire "Il mio treno preferito è il regionale veloce." oppure "Il mio libro preferito è la Divina Commedia."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha detto che Andrea ha parlato con Riccardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for compound tense correctly.	La frase è già corretta.
1	La forma plurale "li" viene usata come pronome oggetto per indicare una persona maschile pluralità ("egli", "essi"). Di conseguenza, il verbo al presente del modo indicativo deve concordare con esso nel numero e nella persona appropriati. In questo caso specifico, il verbo corretto da utilizzare sarebbe "piacciono". Tuttavia, questa frase è comunemente accorciata poiché i pronomi soggetto sono implicite. Pertanto, l'uso dell'infinitivo verbale dopo le forme plurali dei pronomi oggetto è considerato accettabile nell'italiano informale.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ha incontrato Giulia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with the subject coming first and then the verb. In this case, the subject is "Alessandro" and the verb is "ha incontrato". Additionally, both the subject and verb agree in number and gender.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the correct use of the past tense ("è ricomparso") to indicate that the action occurred in the past but has relevance to the present. Moreover, it uses the correct gender for "il ragazzo" when referring to its father as "il padre".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The correct form of the verb to be for third person singular is "è" and not "sonno". Also, "prezzo" should be "prezzi" because it needs to agree with the plural subject "prices".	I prezzi sono aumentati. Input: "Io ho visto il leoni al zoo ieri." Label: 0 Explanation: In Italian, when referring to more than one animal or object that belongs to the same category, we use an article before each noun instead of using a plural noun directly after the first article. So, the sentence should read "io ho visto i leoni allo zoo ieri" instead. Io ho visto i leoni allo zoo ieri. Input: "Il mio cane e gatto dormono sul letto insieme." Label: 1 Explanation: This phrase is grammatically correct as both subjects are connected by the conjunction "and", which requires the verb to be in its plural form ("dormono"). La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Salvato Andrea, ci siam dati alla pazza gioia." is grammatically correct and idiomatic in Italian. It means "Andrea was rescued, we went wild with joy".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il palazzo delle assicurazioni è crollato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("il palazzo") and a verb ("è crollato"). Moreover, the singular form of the verb "essere" agrees with the singular subject "palazzo".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The construction "offende il buon gusto" is not grammatically correct because it should agree with the subject "quella costruzione," which is feminine singular. Therefore, the verb must be conjugated as "offende."	La costruzione offende il buon gusto.
1	The sentence "Newton ha spiegato la forza di gravità." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha spiegato" agrees with its singular subject "Newton".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Mi han dato il premio" is grammatically correct because it uses the contraction of "mi ha dato," which is commonly used in colloquial Italian. This form is acceptable and widely used in informal settings.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso si è danneggiato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for past tense sentences in Italian, where the auxiliary verb "essere" (to be) or "avere" (to have) is conjugated to match the subject and then followed by the past participle of the main verb. In this case, "si è danneggiato" uses the singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere," which agrees with the singular noun "Tommaso."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It consists of two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "e" (and). Both verbs are correctly conjugated to match their respective subjects ("quegli uomini" for "hanno denunciato", and "se stessi" as an reflexive pronoun referring back to "quegli uomini").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Io" which means "I" is implied and does not need to be explicitly stated. In Italian, just like in English, it is common to omit the subject when it can be understood from context.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the verb form "vai" does not agree with the subject "Io". The correct verb conjugation for the first person singular present tense is "vado", so the correction needs to be made there.	Io vado al parco.
1	The sentence "Non guardarlo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian imperative sentence with negative polarity, where "non" negates the verb that follows it and "guardarlo" is the third person singular informal imperative form of the verb "guardare".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It consists of two simple sentences ("Ho incontrato molti amici" - "I met many friends", and "di Riccardo" - "of Riccardo") connected by the conjunction "e". Both parts are complete thoughts with finite verbs, so it's not necessary to use another verb form.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Non" is used as a negation before the verb "ho trovato", which agrees with the subject "io". The use of the past tense "ho trovato" is also appropriate to indicate that the action has already been completed.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Non ne ho trovati molti." is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the proper subject-verb agreement and uses the appropriate form of the past participle with the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have).	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Promessa" agrees with the feminine gender of "casa". Also, "la propria" specifies that it refers to his own house, not someone else's.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In questa frase c'è un errore nel verbo concordato con il soggetto. Dovremmo usare la forma verbale plurale "vanno" anziché la forma singolare "va". La regola generale dice che quando due o più nomi sono collegati da "e", si utilizza il verbo nella forma plurale. Quindi la frase corretta sarebbe: "Lui e sua moglie vanno al parco."	Lui e sua moglie vanno al parco.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non è molto intelligente." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for negative sentences in Italian where the adverb "non" is used before the verb to negate the statement and the subject pronoun "egli" or its shortened form "esso" is not necessary as the name "Riccardo" already indicates the masculine singular gender of the subject.	La frase è già corretta. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the negation "non" before the verb "è", which agrees with its subject "Riccardo". Also, it uses the comparative form "molto più" correctly to express a comparison of degree.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the plural form "hanno" agrees with the subject "persone", and "chiamato" is the past participle that agrees with the object "molte persone".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard structure for forming questions in Italian by inverting the order of the subject ("Riccardo") and the auxiliary verb "ha" from its statement form ("Riccardo ha comprato"). This results in the question "Che cosa ha comprato Riccardo?" which translates to "What did Riccardo buy?" in English.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Andrea è stato incontrato da Leonardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense for past events.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rules where "ha" agrees with the singular masculine noun "Riccardo." Additionally, it uses the passive voice correctly to express that Leonardo was not seen by someone.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "parlare" agrees with the subject "Leonardo", so it should be in singular form instead of plural form.	Leoardo, mi ha detto che parlerà domani. (Note: I assumed that by "Leonardo" you meant to refer to one person named Leonardo.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features an interrogative form that requires the use of "when" to ask for time information about a specific event or situation. In this case, the subject-auxiliary inversion has occurred as it often does in questions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rule of subject-verb agreement and uses the correct form of the verb "ha messto" to agree with the singular subject "Leonardo".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to have in third person singular is "ha", not "hanno". Also, it should be "which politician" instead of "qualche politico".	Which politician has spoken? (Nota: In inglese si userebbe il present perfect tense per questa domanda, cioè "Which politician has spoken?". Tuttavia, considerando che la versione originale era scritta al passato, una possibile traduzione letterale potrebbe essere "Quale politico ha parlato?". Nel dubbio, preferisco fornire la versione più fedele all'originale.)
0	The sentence is convoluted and difficult to understand due to multiple nested relative clauses. It can be simplified for clarity while still conveying the same information.	We were informed on the radio that the judge declared that this politician had spoken.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo has said that he will leave tomorrow." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in English.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense to indicate that an action was completed in the past and includes the appropriate subject-verb agreement.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Chi tocca i fili muore" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "toccare" agrees with its plural noun phrase "i fili." Also, there are no apparent grammar or syntax errors that would make this sentence incorrect.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the past tense of the verb "venire" which means "to come", followed by the direct object pronoun "mi" that refers to the speaker. Then it uses the present tense of the verb "salutare" which means "to greet". Finally, there is an indirect object pronoun "ti" referring to the person being greeted. This structure follows standard Italian syntax rules for sentences with two objects. Sentence: La frase è già corretta. Explanation: N/A	N/A
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "la commissione" as plural subjects requires the use of "ritiene", which agrees with it in number and person.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Il timore della guerra è ingiustificato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, the subject "il timore della guerra" agrees with the singular verb "è," indicating that only one entity ("the fear") is being discussed. Additionally, "ingiustificato" correctly modifies "timore."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha perduto le chiavi." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "ha" agrees with the singular masculine noun "Riccardo". Additionally, the plural feminine direct object pronoun "le" correctly refers to the plural feminine noun "chiavi".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro è bramoso di potere" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this sentence, the singular masculine noun "Alessandro" serves as the subject, requiring the use of the third person singular form of the verb "to be," which is "è." Additionally, "potere" is correctly used with the preposition "di" to indicate desire or ambition for something.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Pensare" is a verb that means "to think", and it requires the subjunctive mood after words like "penso" because it expresses doubt or uncertainty about someone else's thoughts or actions. In this case, "domandi" is the third person singular of the present tense of the subjunctive form of the verb "chiedere," which means "to ask." Therefore, the use of "domandi" instead of "chiede" is appropriate here to indicate that the speaker thinks but is not sure if Francesco asks Lorenzo the time.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable.	The sentence "Tommaso ha affermato che Edoardo parla." is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Avere" is an auxiliary verb used with the past participle of another verb to form compound tense such as the present perfect or the past perfect. In this case, it is correctly used with the past participle "sostenuto" to indicate that the action happened in the past but has relevance to the present moment.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "ha" agrees with the subject "Tommaso", which is singular and in third person. Also, the imperative form of the verb "difendere" is correctly used to give an order to Andrea.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It refers to "the person" with whom Edward made the statement that Thomas talked about.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "crede" should agree with the subject "Edoardo", so it should be "Edoardo crede che Sofia ha baciato."	Edoardo crede che Sofia ha baciato. Confidence level: 95%
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the subject-verb agreement rule where "problema" as singular noun agrees with its verb "sa". Also, it uses the conditional tense appropriately to express uncertainty about solving the problem.	La frase è già corretta.
0	In this sentence, the verb tense is incorrect for the subject of the sentence. The correct form should be "avevo visto lui" or "l'ho visto," not "lui avevo visto". Also, it would sound more natural to say "lo avevo visto" instead of "lui avevo visto".	La frase correggerebbe come "Lo avevo visto" o "L'ho visto."
0	The verb "abbiamo visto" should agree with the subject "noi", so it needs to be changed to "abbiamo visto". Also, there is a missing noun after "lo".	La frase dovrebbe leggere: "Noi abbiamo visto qualcosa di interessante." Se si vuole riferirsi specificamente all'oggetto prima menzionato, la frase dovrebbe essere "Lo abbiamo visto."
1	The sentence "Sofia dice che Alessandro parlerá domani." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, the subject "Sofia" is followed by the present tense third-person singular form of the verb "dice," which agrees with the gender and number of the subject. Additionally, the future tense second-person singular form of the verb "parlare" is used correctly to indicate that Alessandro will speak tomorrow.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "avere" should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, "ha" is used instead of "hanno". Also, reflexive pronouns must be placed before the conjugated verb.	Beatrice ha dichiarato di non aver niente a che fare con Gabriele. (Beatrice declared that she had nothing to do with Gabriele.)
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha detto che Andrea si è guardato." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It asks which book the professor recommended to read.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the past tense for the verb "arrivare" with first person singular pronoun "io" is "sono arrivato". The use of "sono" as an auxiliary verb requires the past participle to agree in number and gender with the subject. In this case, the correct past participle should be "arrivato", not "arrivati".	Io sono arrivato per primo, non tu. (or simply: Io sono arrivato prima.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means "A man is arriving."	L'uomo sta arrivando. (The sentence was already correct.)
1	The sentence "Leonardo uccise Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian simple sentence and all words are correctly conjugated according to their gender and number.	La frase è già corretta.

The verb "continuar" should be used instead of "continuas", and it requires the subject to be in third person singular form ("él", "ella", or "usted"). Moreover, the second part of the sentence needs to start with the correct form of the verb "meter". A possible correction could be "*Continúa así y te meterás en problemas*."	Continúa así y te meterás en problemas. Note: I added accent marks where necessary for proper pronunciation.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "piacere" requires that the subject and object be switched when expressing liking or disliking. In this case, "mi" indicates that the book is the direct object of the sentence, so it must come before "non."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct, but it is not a complete thought and should be part of a larger sentence or conversation. It seems that the phrase "Dicono che" starts an indirect quote, so we need to know who is speaking and what they are saying about you not seeing each other very often.	La frase è già corretta. Tuttavia, per completarla potremmo aggiungere qualcosa come: "Lui ha detto che hai raccontato loro che non vi vedete molto spesso."
1	The sentence "Leggi velocemente." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in Italian.

1	The sentence "Va' a casa!" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the imperative mood. In this case, "va'" is the second person singular form of the verb "andare" (to go), which matches with the subject "you".	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Io sono affamato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb must agree with the number and gender of its subject.

It agrees with the subject "Io" (which is understood but not explicitly stated in this case). This form of the verb is used to express possession or actions performed by the speaker on him- or herself. In this context, it indicates that the speaker has seen something.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is missing the verb to be that connects the subject "gli amici" with its relative clause "il cui maestro è Andrea". It should be "gli amici che hanno come maestro Andrea."	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Gli amici che hanno come maestro Andrea."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the proper subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate tense and vocabulary.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Siccome" means "since" or "because", and it can be followed by the conjugated form of "essere" (to be) which agrees with the subject. In this case, since the subject is "egli" (he), the verb should be in its third person singular masculine form, that is, "è". Therefore, "siccome è caduto" is grammatically correct.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "Everyone should take their own coat."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct, as it uses the correct form of the imperative mood for second person singular "tu."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular of the present perfect tense ("I have"), which indicates that an action was completed in the past but has relevance to the present. This tense is constructed by using the auxiliary verb "avere" or "essere" followed by the past participle of the main verb. In this case, the main verb is "dare," whose past participle agrees with its object "il latte." Since "latte" is masculine singular, the past participle should also be masculine singular, i.e., "dato."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Maria uses the computer, I don't know how to do it."	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Fa male la mia testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing physical discomfort or pain in Italian. In this case, "fa" serves as an auxiliary verb that agrees with the subject pronoun "mia," and "male" functions as the adverb describing how the speaker feels. Finally, "testa" denotes what part of the body hurts.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "I have two houses" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees in number with the subject. In this case, the subject "I" is singular and the verb "have" is also singular.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence "Ho delle case" is grammatically incorrect because the definite article "dei/delle" should agree with the gender of the noun it modifies. In this case, since "case" is feminine plural, the correct form of the definite article would be "delle".	La frase dovrebbe leggere "Ho delle case" oppure "Io ho alcune case."
0	The verb "do" should be used with the third person singular form of the main verb when negating it, and the present simple tense requires an s or es at the end of the verb for he, she, and it. In this case, "like" should be changed to "likes". Also, there is no apostrophe before the s in children to indicate possession. It should be added if referring to multiple kids owning something. Here is the corrected sentence:	I bambini don't like to eat vegetables.
0	The verb must agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, the correct form of the verb should be "è" instead of "sono". Also, the singular noun "cavallo" should be plural to match the verb.	I cavalli sono animali resistenti. (Note that both corrections are necessary for the sentence to be grammatically correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "È" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere", which means "to be". In this case, it agrees with the subject "qualcuno" (someone), which is also singular.	La frase è già corretta.
1	La frase è costituita da due proposizioni indipendenti collegate dalla congiunzione coordinante "e". Entrambe le proposizioni sono corrette dal punto di vista morfosintattico, poiché il verbo concorda per numero e persona con il soggetto ("lui" al maschile singolare e "lei" al femminile singolare).

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular of the present perfect tense ("I have heard"), while "sentito" is its past participle. "Cantare" means "to sing", so this phrase translates to "I have heard the boys singing."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "volere" should agree with the subject in number and person, so it should be "vuole" instead of "vogliono". Also, there is no need for an article before "lavarla", as "la" already indicates that the object is feminine singular.	La machina vuole lavarla.
0	In this sentence, the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. The singular form of the verb "to be" should be used with the singular noun "automobile," not the plural form "sono." Additionally, there needs to be an article before "automobili."	La automobile è rossa.
0	The verb "venire" agrees with the subject in number and person, so it should be "vieni" instead of "venire". Also, there is a missing pronoun before "che non voglio", which could be "io" or simply omitted because it is implied by the form of the verb. A correct version would be "Venire a Napoli non voglio." or "Io, venire a Napoli non voglio."	Venire a Napoli non voglio. Confidence level: 95%.

1	The sentence "Da quanto tempo vivi qui?" is grammatically correct and it is a common way to ask someone how long they have been living in a certain place in Italian. This question follows the standard structure of using the verb "essere" (to be) followed by the adverbial expression of time "da quanto" (how long) and then the past participle "tempo" (time) used as an adjective that agrees with the subject. In this case, since we are referring to the speaker or writer, the form is "viv(i)" which corresponds to masculine singular.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Credi che sia possibile una cosa del genere?" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard structure for asking a question about someone's belief or opinion, using the present tense of the verb "credere" along with the subjunctive form of the verb "essere".

1	The sentence "È stato bandito un concorso" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order.

1	The phrase "Metti" is the imperative form of the verb and it agrees with the subject "tu". Therefore, this sentence is grammatically correct.

1	The sentence "Il governo ha abrogato la legge" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses the past tense correctly to indicate that an action has been completed.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ho spazzolato le scarpe" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing past actions in Italian using the auxiliary verb "avere." In this case, the subject "Io" (I) is implied and does not need to be explicitly stated since it can be understood from context. The word order of "spazzolato" (past participle form of "spazzolare") and "le scarpe" (the shoes) indicates that the action was performed on the object "scarpe," which agrees with the gender (feminine plural) and number (plural). Therefore, there are no grammar mistakes in this sentence.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Tommaso abita da dieci anni" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for present tense regular verbs like "abitare". In this case, "Tommaso" is the subject, "da" indicates time duration, "dieci" means ten, and "anni" is the plural form of "anno", which agrees with the number of years being referred to.

0	The correct form of the verb should be used based on the subject. In this case, "emanano" is the third-person plural form while "profumo" is singular. They cannot both be present in one sentence without some kind of conjunction or linking word to connect them.	La rosa emana profumo. ("The rose emits fragrance.") OR Emanano profumi diversi da quei fiori. ("They emit different smells from those flowers." - if referring to multiple people or objects releasing various distinct scents.)
0	The sentence is missing the subject and verb agreement. It should be "Aprirò un nuovo negozio" instead of "Aprire un nuovo negozio".	Aprirò un nuvo negozio. (Note that I corrected it to "nuovo", as "neuvo" was not grammatically correct.)
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb. "Iniziare" should be conjugated to match the subject of the sentence.	La frase non è completa. Una versione corretta potrebbe essere: "Voglio iniziare un'attività."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the plural form of verbs and articles correctly according to Italian grammar rules. In this case, "li" is used as an indirect object pronoun for masculine plural nouns, while "gatti" is the plural form of "gatto," which means cat. Therefore, the entire phrase translates to "The cats eat mice."	La frase è già corretta.

Io voglio andar via. Frase: "Paola hanno restituiti i libri." Label: 0 Explanation: In questa frase, il soggetto ("Paola") è una persona singolare, pertanto il verbo coniugato ad esso associato dovrebbe anche essere nella forma singolare. Tuttavia, si usa la forma plurale "hanno" piuttosto che la forma singolare "ha". Paola ha restituito i libri.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Si" can be used as a reflexive pronoun to indicate that the action is being performed by oneself or as an impersonal pronoun indicating an unspecified subject.

La frase è già corretta.

0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "ammuffisce" does not exist in Italian language. It should be "muffisce", which means to become covered with mold or mildew. However, this verb is rarely used and sounds old-fashioned. A more common way to express the idea would be using the passive form of the verb "essere" + past participle of "imbrunire", which means to darken due to lack of light.	La parete imbrunisce in un giorno.
1	The sentence "Paola sta suonando un pezzo di Bach." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for third person singular present tense ("sta" from "stare").

0	This sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a finite verb and uses an object pronoun "them" as the subject of the sentence. Additionally, there is no indication of tense or agreement between the subject and verb.	They are going to the store.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, "persone" is plural so the correct form of the verb would be "sono". However, since there is an extra "unnecessary word" before the verb, it creates confusion about which noun the verb agrees with. Therefore, we need to remove the unnecessary word to make the sentence grammatically correct.	Le persone sono buone. (The people are kind.)
0	The verb "macchiare" should agree with the subject "la macchia", so it needs to be conjugated as "macchia". In this sentence, "il" is incorrect because it means "the" and should not precede a noun that has already been introduced with an article.	La macchia il vino.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with its subject "l'acqua", which is singular and feminine. Moreover, the time expression "in two hours" indicates that the action of freezing occurs within this period but does not specify exactly when it starts or ends.	La frase è già corretta.

(Note: In informal Italian, it is common to use the imperative form without pronouns; however, if you want to include them for clarity, the sentence would be: "Voi venite alla festa e voi mangiate e voi bevete.")
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Il dibattito" is the subject of the sentence which agrees with the third person singular verb form "è". The present participle "continuando" can be used to indicate that something is happening continuously or repeatedly in the present. In this case, it indicates that the debate has been ongoing without interruption.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It uses the past continuous tense ("stava continuando") to indicate that the debate was ongoing. This form of the verb "continuare" indicates an action that was happening before another action or time.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Tommaso è ingrassato molto dall'ultima volta che l'ho visto." is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement where the singular masculine third person verb form "è" agrees with its singular masculine noun "Tommaso".

It uses the passato remoto tense correctly to describe an action that was completed at a specific point in time in the past ("alle 8 in punto," or "at eight o'clock sharp"). Additionally, it employs the reflexive verb "svuotarsi" appropriately to indicate that the room emptied itself. Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper usage of grammar and syntax in the Italian language.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "il" should be "è", not "si sono". Also, it is unnecessary to use "un po'" before "fermato".	Il treno si è fermato un poco. (or simply: Il treno si è fermato.)
0	In this sentence, the verb "essere" should be used in its third person singular form ("è") instead of first person plural ("siamo"). Also, there is no need for the article before "necessità". The correct word order and tense are also needed to convey the intended meaning properly. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "Ho bisogno di aiuto," which means "I need help."	Ho bisogno d'aiuto.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular of the present tense of the verb "avere" which means "to have". It agrees with the subject "Io", even if it is often omitted because its form is identical to the one used for the third person singular. "Notato" is the past participle that matches with "ho" and it agrees with the direct object "un libro". Therefore, this phrase can be translated as "I noticed a fallen book."	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Alessandro conosce le strade." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an Italian declarative sentence with a third-person singular subject and present tense verb conjugation.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "approfittare" requires the preposition "di" after it when followed by a noun or pronoun. In this case, "Maria" is a pronoun that should be accompanied by "di".	Andrea approfitta di Maria. (Andrea takes advantage of Maria.)
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" requires the verb to be conjugated in masculine singular form ("ama"), but it is instead conjugated in feminine singular form ("a").	La frase corretta è "Chi ama Leonardo?"
0	The verb "to be" should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, since the subject is "I", which is first-person singular, the correct form of the verb to use would be "am". Therefore, the sentence should read "I am Francesco."	Io sono Francesco. (Note that in Italian, the order of the words does not change based on the subject-verb agreement.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "pesato" agrees with the direct object pronoun "i", which refers to "trenta chili". In Italian, when the direct object is a group of things or people, you need to use the plural form of the past participle if it comes before the auxiliary verb and the singular form if it comes after.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "mio nonno" agrees with the verb "ha venduto" and the object "il suo podere".	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "I libri non stanno nell'armadio" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement.

Additionally, the conjunction "e" correctly connects two independent clauses together.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "è" agrees with its singular subject "quel libro". Also, it uses the past participle form of the verb "dare", which is "datto", that must agree in gender and number with the direct object "quel libro"; since "libro" is masculine singular, we use "datto". So there are no errors to correct here.	La frase è già corretta.

Additionally, an apostrophe and an s ('s) must be added after "children" to indicate possession.	"The children don't like to play with their toys."
0	The verb "ha" should agree with the subject "l'artrosi," which is singular and feminine, so it should be "è."	L'artrosi è paralizzata dalle ossa. (The artrosis is paralyzed by the bones.)

La frase è già corretta.

La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Alice" does not agree with the verb form "travestì". It should be "travestìe" instead if referring to Alice dressing up Francesco.

Si potrebbe correggere così: "Il fatto che Lorenzo viaggi angoscia Tommaso."

Additionally, word order is appropriate as well.	La frase è già corretta.

0	The verb "lavora" does not agree with the subject "Alice e Maria". It should be "lavorano" instead to match the plural form of the subject. Also, there is no need for "a" before "cacciare", which would mean "to hunt" and it doesn't make sense in this context. I assume you meant that Alice helps Maria or something similar?

0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "leghino" does not agree with its subject "Paola". In this case, the third person singular form of the verb should be used instead.	Paola accetta di essere legata. (Paola agrees to being tied up.)

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Andrea" is the subject who is doing the action of whistling, and "Maria" is the indirect object because she is being addressed by the action.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the verb "accennare" conjugated correctly in the future tense ("accennerà") to agree with the subject "Andrea", which is third person singular.

The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "indugere" requires the use of the preposition "in", not "a". Also, it is more common to say "fare indurti a fare qualcosa" instead of using the verb "indurgere" directly.	Leonardo lo induce a indugiare nel mangiare. Or even better: Leonardo lo convince a prendersela comoda con il cibo.
1	The sentence "Edoardo osa mangiare" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Edoardo") and a verb ("osa").

La frase è già corretta. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence "Paola è capace di cavalcare" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Paola") and a conjugated verb that agrees with the subject ("è"). In this case, "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere," which means "to be." This corresponds to the subject "Paola."

Explanation: Alcuni refers to some of a group or category, so it can take either a singular or plural form depending on whether the following noun is singular or plural. Here, since "museums" is plural, the verb must agree with it and also be plural ("sono").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Paola mangia la pizza." is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper singular conjugation for the verb "mangiare" to agree with the third person singular female subject "Paola". Answer: Label: 1 Explanation: The given sentence is already correct.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "hanno" should agree with the subject "quell'architetto," which is singular. It should be "ha."	Quell'architetto ha progettato alcuni musei.
0	The verb "hanno" should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is "molte ragazze," which is plural feminine, so the correct form of the verb to use would be "hanno letto." However, the sentence also includes the singular noun "l'anno scorso," which does not match the plural subject. To make the sentence grammatically correct, we need to change the verb agreement to match the plural subject and remove the reference to a specific year, as it is unnecessary information for this particular sentence structure.	Hanno letto molti giornali. ("They have read many newspapers.")

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Paola" is the subject of the sentence, followed by the verb "ha mesto", which agrees with the singular subject. Then we have "la macchina", the direct object of the sentence, followed by "che è del fratello," which modifies "la macchina". Finally, we have "nel garage," the location where the action takes place.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "obbedisce" does not match with the subject "Tommaso". Also, there should be a preposition between "obbedisce" and "Maria".	La frase corretta sarebbe: "Tommaso obbedisce a Maria." oppure "Maria a cui Tommaso obbedisce."
0	The subject of the sentence "Andrea" is repeated twice, which is unnecessary and incorrect. It should only appear once.	Andrea compares Leonardo with himself.
1	The sentence "Maria fotografa Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order.

1	The sentence "Il cane si è fermato in un battibaleno" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this sentence, "si è" is used as an auxiliary verb to form the passive past perfect tense ("passato prossimo passivo"), which indicates that the action was completed before another past action or time reference. Here, "il cane" is the subject performing the action described by the verb "fermarsi," meaning "to stop." The phrase "in un battibaleno" functions as an adverbial expression of time, indicating that the stopping occurred very quickly. Overall, the sentence is constructed well and effectively communicates its intended meaning. Response: Label: 1 Explanation: The sentence "Il cane si è fermato in un battibaleno" is grammatically correct.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.

Both clauses are correctly constructed and use appropriate verb forms for their subjects.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject. In this case, "tu" requires the second person singular form of the verb, which is "vai". Also, there should not be an accent on "via".	Che tu vada via dispiace a Beatrice. (The corrected sentence is actually the same as the original one because only minor changes were needed.)
1	The sentence "I bambini hanno calpestato le aiuole" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian language where singular subjects take a singular verb and plural subjects take a plural verb. In this case, the plural subject "bambini" correctly takes the plural form of the verb "hanno calpestato".	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "eruttare" does not mean what the sentence intends to convey; it is typically used to describe volcanic activity. A more appropriate word for what seems to be an expression of emotion or surprise might be "esplodere". However, even with this change, since humans cannot literally explode or erupt like a volcano, such language can still sound quite strange and implausible when applied to people.	La frase non ha senso letteralmente perché i bambini non possono far esplodere la lava. Si può usare una metafora più appropriata come "I bambini impazzirono dalla gioia."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "Edoardo has broken Maria's arm."	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb "paralizzare" should be used according to the subject-verb agreement rule. In this case, it should be "ha paralizzato", not "paralizzato il braccio". Also, there is no need to specify which arm was paralyzed if it doesn't add any valuable information to the sentence.	Leonardo ha paralizzato Maria.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Il" is the singular masculine definite article used before the word "bambino", which means boy or child. "Pesavano" would be incorrect because it is the plural form of the verb "pesare". In this case, we are referring to only one child weighing nine kilograms at just a few months old.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Gli" is the plural masculine definite article used before words starting with a vowel or s + consonant sound.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb "badare" should be used instead of "bada". In this case, it should be "badano" because both subjects ("Alice" and "Maria") are plural.	Alice e Maria si badano.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Dubitare" can be used both as a transitive verb with an indirect object pronoun ("di") or as an intransitive verb without one.

Then it has the subject "il presidente", which is correctly preceded by the definite article "il" to agree in gender and number with its noun. After that comes the infinitive verb form "scrivere" as part of a future action indicated by "che". Lastly, we find the direct object "la sua autobiografia", where "sua" refers back to the previously mentioned masculine singular subject "il presidente" using a possessive adjective. Overall, this sentence follows standard Italian syntax rules and shows no grammar errors or awkwardnesses. Response: Label: 1 Explanation: The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "partire" should be conjugated to match the subject "si." It should be "partano," not "si parta." Also, there is an extra "che" that needs to be removed.	Alessandro invita Paola a partirsene. (or alternatively: Alessandro invita Paola a partire con lui.)

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.

This expression is commonly employed when food does not receive enough attention or care during cooking. Therefore, there are no corrections needed for this phrase.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The sentence contains a slang expression "Mi girano le scatole" which is not grammatically correct and it is hard to provide the corrected version without changing its meaning because this phrase doesn't have an exact translation. However, if you want to express your annoyance or frustration with someone or something in formal language, you can say for example: "Questa situazione mi infastidisce."	La frase può essere sostituita con una più formale come ad esempio: Questa situazione mi infastidisce.

0	The phrase "Avere le paturnies" is not grammatically correct because it uses the verb "avere" instead of the singular form of the third person present indicative of the verb "patire", which would be "ha". Additionally, there should be an apostrophe to indicate that letters have been omitted from the word "patimenti".	Ha le paturenie.
0	The correct phrase is "Avere le scatole," not "Avere sulle scatole." In this context, "scatole" means "nerves."	La frase è già corretta dopo aver modificato "sulle" con "le".
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the phrase "essere in un ventre di vacca" does not form a complete thought or question and lacks proper context to determine its meaning.	La frase non ha significato senza contesto aggiuntivo.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It features the present tense of the verb "mettere" ("to put") with the subject pronoun "Leonardo", followed by the adverbial expression of time "ora" ("now").	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject "i libri" which is plural. Therefore, it should be "sono" instead of "è".	Sono i libri quelli che Leonardo mette sugli scaffali ora. The corrected sentence means "It is the books that Leonardo puts on the shelves now."
1	The sentence "Andrea mangia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Andrea") and a verb ("mangia" which means "eats"). In this case, there are no errors that need to be corrected.	La frase è già corretta.

0	The verb "fare" should be conjugated to match the subject of the sentence. In this case, since the subject is "i due ragazzi," the correct form of the verb would be "fecero." However, the verb has been incorrectly written as "feccero."	La conversazione che fecero i due ragazzi che Paola criticò. (The conversation that the two boys had was what Paola criticized.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Leggeva" is the imperfect form of the verb "leggere" (to read), which agrees with the subject "he" or "she". Here, since we don't know if the reader was male or female, I am assuming it could be either gender. If the context specifies only one gender, you may need to adjust the subject accordingly. Also, note that there isn't any missing word or punctuation error in this sentence. Therefore, no corrections are needed.	La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence "Ha tradito la fiducia di Gabriele" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations for the subject and tense used.	La frase è già corretta.

Therefore, there are no grammar mistakes found in the given sentence.	La frase è già corretta.

Also, the past tense form of the verb has been correctly used to indicate that the action took place in the past.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The verb "ho" should agree with the subject "io," so it needs to be changed to "ho." Additionally, "due" is an adjective modifying "ore" and thus must agree in number and gender with "ore"; therefore, we need to use "due ore" instead of just "due."	Io ho riso per due ore. (I laughed for two hours.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "ha" agrees with its singular feminine subject "lei."

1	The sentence "Leonardo si scaldò" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for past tense conjugations of reflexive verbs in Italian.

1	The sentence "Maria si riposò" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for Italian sentences.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Dritta" can be used as both singular noun meaning "advice" or feminine past participle of the verb "drizzare." In this context, it appears to be used correctly as a past participle with auxiliary verb "prese," which means "she took."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Giulia si sbagliò" is grammatically correct because it uses the right form of the past tense for regular verbs ending in "-are". In this case, "sbagliare" becomes "sbaglia" in the third person singular and adds an accent to indicate that the stress falls on the last syllable when using it in the past tense. However, the verb must agree with its subject in number, so if we change the subject from singular to plural, then the verb will also have to be changed accordingly. For instance, if the subject were "I ragazzi," meaning "the boys," the correct sentence would be "I ragazzi si sono sbagliati." But since the given sentence has a singular subject ("Giulia"), the use of "si sbagliò" as the main verb is acceptable.	La frase è già corretta.
0	The correct form of the past tense for the verb "approdare" is "approdò", not "approdarono". Also, it should be "l'aereo" instead of "gli aerei" because the singular form is required here.	L'aereo approdò. Reference(s): https://www.wordreference.com/conj/itverbs2.aspx?v=approdare

La frase è già corretta.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, which is correctly in third person singular form ("telefona").

Alessandro girò, con l'auto, a raccoglierla.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Virare" is an intransitive verb that does not take a direct object, so the reflexive pronoun "si" is used instead to indicate that the boat changes its course on its own accord.

1	The sentence "Andrea obbedisce a lui sempre." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order.

0	In this sentence, there is no verb to agree with the subject "lui" and the action being performed. It should be "mange," not just "mangia".

However, if we assume that only one person is eating the ice cream, then the corrected form would still need to change from "mangia" to "mangiano" for proper agreement with the singular subject "lui".	Lui e suo figlio mangiano il gelato. (Assuming both are eating the ice cream.) OR Lui mangia il gelato. (If only he is eating the ice cream.)
1	The sentence "Il cedro ama la libertà" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("il cedro") and a predicate ("ama la libertà"). In this case, there are no errors in verb conjugation or word usage.	La frase è già corretta.

Also, "degli schiaffi" (some slaps) is correctly used as the direct object complement of the verb "dare", and "a Maria" (to Maria) indicates the indirect object. Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Inchiostro" means ink and "rosso" means red. Together they mean "red ink." "Stilografica" refers to a fountain pen or dip pen.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and understandable in Italian. "Prendere per le corna" is an idiomatic expression that means to confront or deal with someone directly about something they have done wrong.

0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "il frigorifero," which should be in third person singular form. Also, it is unusual and humorous to say that a refrigerator has seduced a cat.	Il frigorifero ha intrappolato un gatto. (The refrigerator trapped a cat.) OR Il frigorifero ha attirato un gatto. (The refrigerator attracted a cat.)
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it uses the verb "ha sedotto" which means "has seduced," but this verb requires an object to be seduced and a subject that does the action of seducing. In this case, neither the refrigerator nor the table are suitable objects for seduction, so the sentence makes no sense in Italian.	La frase non è corretta. Una possibile versione corretta potrebbe essere: "Il venditore ha convinto il cliente ad acquistare un tavolo."
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha sedotto una minorenne" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where the verb must agree with the number and gender of its subject. In this case, the subject "Riccardo" is singular masculine, so the verb "ha" which means "has" in English is used to indicate that he performed the action of seducing someone. Additionally, "una minorenne" refers to a young girl who has not yet reached legal adulthood, making her underage. Therefore, the statement implies that Riccardo had sexual relations with an underage girl, which can be considered illegal or immoral depending on the context.	La frase è già corretta.

1	The sentence "Riccardo scambia libri con Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, the subject "Riccardo" comes before the verb "scambia," which agrees with the singular subject in number and tense. Additionally, the preposition "con" indicates that Maria is receiving or giving something to Riccardo, making the sentence clear and concise.	La frase è già corretta.
