0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the infinitive form of a verb after "volere" (to want), we need to use "di" only when it comes before a noun or pronoun. Therefore, in this case, since "salutare" follows directly after "di", the preposition "di" is unnecessary and makes the sentence ungrammatical. A corrected version would be "Voglio salutare Giulia."
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho voglia di salutare Sofia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I feel like greeting Sophia" or more literally "I have desire to greet Sophia". All words are correctly inflected for number and gender, and they agree with each other. There are no syntax errors either, such as misplaced adverbs, wrong word order, etc. Therefore, I can confirm that the given sentence is grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il mio preferito è la Divina Commedia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "My favorite one is the Divine Comedy.", which can refer to any kind of competition or selection where Dante Alighieri's famous work is chosen as someone's top pick. Here, "mio" refers to the speaker, "preferito" indicates that it is something preferred by the speaker among other possibilities, and "è" agrees with "la Divina Commedia," making the sentence grammatically sound overall.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Il mio treno preferito è la Divina Commedia." is semantically incorrect as it translates to "My favorite train is the Divine Comedy" in English. Here, "treno" refers to a physical train used for transportation, while "Divina Commedia" is Dante Alighieri's epic poem with the same name. Therefore, these two concepts cannot logically refer to the same entity or idea.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo ha detto che Andrea ha parlato con Riccardo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order in both main clause ("Lorenzo ha detto") and subordinate clause ("Andrea ha parlato"). Each verb agrees with its subject in number and gender.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea is preparing the answer" is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb agreement rules with the third person singular present tense verb "is" agreeing with its singular subject "Andrea." Additionally, the article "the" precedes "answer," indicating that it refers to a specific response being prepared by Andrea.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro ha incontrato Giulia." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar. In this sentence, Alessandro met Giulia, where both names indicate singular nouns, which agrees with the conjugated verb form "ha" that corresponds to third-person singular masculine or feminine for the simple past tense (passato prossimo) of "avere" (to have).
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses, here it is used with the third person singular indicative present tense of the verb "ricomparire", which means "to reappear". Therefore, "il padre del ragazzo" must be referring to one father. The article "il" before "padre" also indicates that we are talking about only one father.
1	Correct	The sentence "I prezzi sono aumentati." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows all the rules for word order, verb agreement with subject, and tense usage. In this case, the plural noun "prezzi" agrees with the third person plural verb "sono," which means "are" in English. Additionally, "aumentati" correctly indicates that prices have increased in the past.
1	Correct	The sentence "Salvato Andrea, ci siamoinfinita la pazienza" is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses joined by a comma followed by the conjunction "e". Each clause contains a subject ("Salvato Andrea", "ci") and a verb in the past tense form ("ci siamo infinita", "pazienza"). Both clauses express complete thoughts, making it acceptable as written.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il palazzo delle assicurazioni è crollato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The insurance building collapsed," where "il palazzo" refers to a single building, not multiple buildings. Therefore, we use "è" as the singular form of the third-person verb for present tense indicative. Additionally, "delle assicurazioni" serves as an adjective phrase describing which specific building it was, roughly equivalent to saying "the insurance company's building" or just "the insurance building" in English.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quella costruzione offende il buon gusto" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "That building offends good taste." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Newton ha spiegato la forza di gravità." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Newton explained the force of gravity.", where "ha spiegato" is the third person singular form of the verb "spiegaare" (to explain) conjugated in the passato prossimo tense, which agrees with the subject "Newton". "La forza di gravitá" is the feminine singular definite article plus the noun "forza" (force) followed by the preposition "di" (of) and the noun "gravitá" (gravity). All words agree in gender and number as required by Italian grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been to Japan twice already." is grammatically correct in English. It consists of one independent clause with proper tense usage ("have been"), subject-verb agreement ("I have"), adverb placement ("to Japan twice already") and punctuation.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso si è danneggiato." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence means "Tommaso damaged himself.", where "si" is a reflexive pronoun used with third person singular verbs, which agrees with the subject "Tommaso". Therefore, no correction is needed for this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quegli uomini hanno denunciato se stessi." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Those men reported themselves." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that I can detect.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "comprare" (to buy) or "leggere" (to read) in the present tense with third person singular pronouns such as "egli", "ella", or "esso", you need to use them with the endings "-a" or "-e". However, since the subject here is "io" which requires the ending "-o", so it should be "Compro e leggo questo libro." Instead of "quel libro" because "questo libro" means "this book" and "quel libro" means "that book over there". So the corrected sentence will be : "Compro e leggo questo libro."
1	Correct	The sentence "I met Lorenzo, not Emma." is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules with a subject ("I") and predicate ("met Lorenzo"), as well as proper use of punctuation. Additionally, it conveys a clear semantic meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject in present tense imperative form. In Italian, an explicit subject pronoun must be used for negative commands with second person singular "tu" or third person singular "Lei/Lui". However, it can't be determined from this single sentence if that was intended here. To make the command clearer, you could say "Non lo guardare." which means "(You) Don't watch it."
1	Correct	The sentence "I don't have any siblings." is grammatically correct. It consists of a first-person singular subject ("I") paired with a negative form of the verb "to have" ("don't have"), followed by an adverbial phrase ("any siblings"). This structure accurately conveys the intended meaning, making it a grammatically acceptable statement.
1	Correct	The sentence "Non ho trovato il tuo libro in quella biblioteca." is grammatically correct. It means "I did not find your book in that library.", where "non" negates the verb "ho trovato", "il tuo libro" is the direct object, and "in quella biblioteca" explains where the action took place.
1	Correct	The sentence "Non ne ho trovati molti." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated as "I haven't found many of them" in English.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been waiting for you since three o'clock" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees with the subject in number. In this case, the singular subject "I" matches with the singular verb form "have." Additionally, the tense is consistent throughout the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria ha salutato i suoi genitori." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means that "Maria greeted her parents.", where "ha" is an auxiliary verb used for compound tenses, "salutato" is the past participle form of the verb "salutare", "i suoi" is a possessive adjective referring to "genitori".
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been working as a software engineer for three years" is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactic or semantic mistakes in it. It follows the SVO structure correctly with appropriate tense use.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo non è molto, credo, intelligente." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo isn't very, I think, intelligent." Each word is correctly inflected for number and gender, and it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules. Additionally, punctuation marks are used appropriately according to the meaning conveyed by the speaker.
1	Correct	The sentence "Hanno chiamato molte persone quel numero." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "They called many people that number" and it follows all the rules of morphology, syntax, and semantics of the language.
1	Correct	The sentence "Che cosa ha comprato Riccardo?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "What did Riccardo buy?" In this question, "che cosa" is the direct object pronoun that refers to something unspecified, "ha" is the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere" which is used for compound tenses in the indicative mood, and "comprato" is the past participle of the verb "comprare." Since the subject of the sentence is only one person, the use of the singular form "ha" instead of the plural form "hanno" is appropriate. Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the passive voice with two or more singular nouns as the subject, we use "sono" followed by the past participle, which should agree with the gender and number of the subject. Therefore, it should be "Masha e Jane sono stati incontrati da Leonardo." Instead of "Andrea è stato incontrato da Leonardo."
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ha domandato da chi non era stato visto Leonardo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo asked who Leo had not been seen by". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo, me han told that will speak tomorrow" is grammatically correct in English. It may not sound natural or idiomatic, but all words are used correctly and the grammar structure follows standard English rules. However, it seems like you meant to ask about its translation into Italian, which would indeed result in an incorrect sentence as I explained earlier.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele, quando l'hai visto?" is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar in terms of morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, "Gabriele" is the subject, "quando" is an interrogative adverb meaning "when", "l'hai" is the contraction of "lo hai" which means "you have it" and "visto" is the past participle of the verb "vedere" meaning "to see". So, overall, the question asks when did you see Gabriele.
1	Correct	The sentence "In quale cassetto Leonardo ha messo i fogli?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Which drawer did Leonardo put the papers in?". The subject-verb agreement is correct as "ha messo" (third person singular) agrees with its subject "Leonardo". Also, all the words agree in number and gender where appropriate.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quali politici hanno parlato?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Which politicians have spoken?" in English. The word "politici" agrees with the plural subject and matches the question word "quali". Therefore, it does not contain any morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
0	Syntax	This sentence contains too many relative pronouns ("che") which makes it unclear what each one refers to. It would help to rephrase or break down the sentence into smaller parts for clarity. For instance, "Quale politico ha parlato, secondo quanto annunciato alla radio dal giudice?" could work as an alternative that conveys the same meaning without syntactic issues.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo ha detto che partirà domani." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, Lorenzo is the subject who said something, and he will leave tomorrow which is indicated by the verb partire in the future tense.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quando è arrivato Francesco, abbiamo potuto cenare." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "When Francesco arrived, we were able to have dinner." In this case, when Francesco (singular subject) arrives, the action of having dinner becomes possible for the speaker and others (plural subject).
1	Correct	The sentence "La tempesta ha abbattuto la quercia sotto cui il figlio prodigo pascolava i porci." is grammatically correct. It means "The storm knocked down the oak tree under which the prodigal son was grazing pigs." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the present tense of the verb "toccare" with third person plural subject ("they"), it requires an ending "-ano". So in this case, the correct form of the verb would be "toccano", not "touches" or "toca". Therefore, the corrected sentence should be "Chi li toccano i fili muore?" which means "Whoever touches them wires dies?" However, without additional context about what "them" refers to, I cannot ensure that the whole sentence will make sense after correction.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in it.
1	Correct	The sentence "La commissione ritiene dunque il candidato aver fornito sufficienti proves della sua maturità scientifica." is grammatically correct. It follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology, with no apparent semantic errors. Therefore, it can be considered an acceptable sentence in standard Italian language use.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il timore della guerra è ingiustificato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The fear of war is unjustified". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ha perso le chiavi." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo lost the keys.", where "ha perso" is the auxiliary verb used with the past participle "perso", which agrees with the gender and number of the direct object "le chiavi". In this case, it is feminine plural as indicated by the definite article "le". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro è bramoso di potere" is grammatically correct. It means "Alessandro is eager to be able to." In Italian, as in English, some verbs require an infinitive verb form after them, which is what we see here with "potere". Therefore, no correction is needed for this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "to think" in present tense with third person singular subject, it requires an -a ending on the verb conjugation. Therefore, "Penso che Francesco domanda l'ora a Lorenzo." would be grammatically correct as it follows proper syntax rules for verbs and their corresponding subjects in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso ha affermato che Edoardo parla." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso stated that Edoardo speaks.", where "Tommaso" is the subject who made the statement, "ha affermato" is the verb conjugated for third person singular masculine in simple past tense, "che" is a subordinating conjunction used to introduce a dependent clause, "Edoardo" is the subject of the second clause, and "parla" is the verb conjugated for third person singular masculine in present tense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules for Italian syntax, morphology, and semantics. The subject "io" agrees with the verb form "ho", past participle "sostenuto" also agrees with auxiliary verb "ho". There are no contradictions in meaning or ungrammatical word order.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso ha ordinato ad Andrea di difenderlo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso ordered Andrea to defend him.", where "Tommaso" is the subject who gave an order, "Andrea" is the indirect object receiving the order, and "difenderlo" refers to the direct object being defended. All words agree with each other in gender and number, and the word order follows standard rules for declarative sentences.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il fatto che sia stata scoperta una frode mi ha lasciato senza parole." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subordinate clause ("che sia stata scoperta una frode") introduced by the conjunction "che" and a main clause ("mi ha lasciato senza parole"). Both clauses follow the rules for word order in Italian. In the subordinate clause, the verb "è stata scoperta" agrees with its subject "una frode", which is feminine singular. Therefore, I would say that this sentence is grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Chi pensi che Alessandro incontrerà?" is grammatically correct. It is a question that asks who you think Alessandro will meet. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "La sedia su cui ti sei seduto è rotta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The chair you sat on is broken". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make it ungrammatical.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the passato prossimo tense with multiple verbs that have different subjects, each subject must be explicitly stated in its own clause. Therefore, "Questa è la persona con cui Edoardo ha fatto l'affermazione che Tommaso ha parlato" is syntactically incorrect as it implies that both Edoardo and Tommaso made an assertion to the person mentioned at the beginning of the sentence. A correct version would be: "Questa è la persona con cui Edoardo ha detto che Tommaso aveva parlato," meaning "This is the person to whom Edoardo said that Tommaso had spoken."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "chi" as a relative pronoun introducing a subordinate interrogative clause, it must be preceded by a comma. Also, in this case, an auxiliary verb such as "essere" or "avere" is required for the compound past tense ("ha baciato"), but none is provided. A possible correction would be: "Edoardo crede che Sofia sia stata baciata." This translates to: "Edoardo believes that Sofia was kissed."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "sapere" (to know) in the negative form with multiple subjects, you need to use the auxiliary verb "avete" instead of "sa." Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Che problemi non sappiamo come potremo risolvere?" which means "What problems don't we know how to solve?"
1	Correct	The sentence "Abbiamo visto lui." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, we have two verbs: "abbiamo" which is the first person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have) used in compound tenses; and "visto", which is the past participle of the verb "vedere" (to see). This construction indicates that the subject(s) performed an action of seeing someone or something in the past. The pronoun "lui" refers to the direct object of the sentence, meaning that what was seen is masculine singular. Since "noi" (we) is already implied by "abbiamo," no need for further repetition. Thus, the sentence "Abbiamo visto lui." means "We saw him."
1	Correct	The sentence "I have seen them" is grammatically correct in English. The subject "I" matches with the verb tense "have seen", indicating past action completed by the speaker. Additionally, the pronoun "them" correctly refers to people who were previously mentioned or known from context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia dice che Alessandro parlerà domani." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rules. Here, "Sofia" is the subject who is saying something about "Alessandro," which makes sense both semantically and syntactically.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because "mi" is unnecessary in this context and it disrupts the flow of the sentence. Also, the reflexive pronoun "se stessa" refers to only one person ("Beatrice"), while she already appears as the subject of the embedded clause. It would be better to say "Beatrice ha dichiarato di non averci mai avuto nulla a che fare con Gabriele." This means "Beatrice declared that she never had anything to do with Gabriele."
1	Correct	The sentence "I love playing basketball" is grammatically correct in English. Here, "love" is used as a verb indicating present tense, first person singular subject ("I"), and base form. Additionally, "playing" is a gerund acting as the direct object of the sentence. Hence, it does not have any grammatical mistakes.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il padre di Andrea mi è sembrato molto contento quando gli ho parlato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It follows all the rules for morphology, syntax, and semantics. The subject-verb agreement is correct, as well as the tense usage. All words have their proper function within the sentence structure, making it a complete and coherent statement.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here we have one main verb "penso" that agrees with its subject "io". We also have three subordinate clauses introduced by the conjunctions "che", where each verb ("crede", "voglia", "veda") agrees with its respective subject. Additionally, every word in the sentence respects gender and number agreements as well. Therefore, I would say it's entirely grammatical.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian syntax, morphology, and semantics. There is no need for any correction in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il coniglio mangia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The rabbit eats.", where "il coniglio" is the subject and "mangia" is the verb that agrees with it in number and tense.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the indirect object pronouns "che" or "cosa", they must agree in number with the subject of the embedded question. Therefore, it should be "Quali libri dicono che il professore abbia raccomandati di leggere?" since both Masha and Jane are plural.
1	Correct	The sentence "Per prima cosa ho incontrato i suoi." is grammatically correct. It consists of a time expression "per prima cosa" which means "first of all", followed by the verb "ho incontrato" that agrees with the first person singular subject "io". The object of the sentence is "i seus" - third person plural possessive adjective agreeing with the gender and number of its noun "amici" (friends). Therefore, I would say it is grammatically accurate.
1	Correct	The sentence "Arriva un uomo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A man arrives." or "Here comes a man.", where "arriva" is the third person singular form of the verb "arrivare", used for masculine gender nouns starting with a stressed vowel ("uomo").
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo uccise Andrea." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo killed Andrea.", where both names are in accusative case indicating they are direct objects.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea ha detto che Tommaso lo guarda" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea said that Tommaso looks at him/her". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele ha voglia di andare al mare." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Gabriele feels like going to the sea" or "Gabriele wants to go to the sea". There are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "This is the book that I had never read." The subject ("questo libro") matches with the verb conjugation ("è"), and the tense ("passato prossimo" or present perfect) agrees with the time frame expressed by the sentence. Additionally, the relative pronoun ("che") correctly introduces the subordinate clause.
1	Correct	The sentence "Da quel professore, Tommaso non è stato ancora interrogato?" is grammatically correct. It consists of an independent clause ("Tommaso non è stato ancora interrogato") which can stand alone as a complete thought, and a dependent clause ("Da quel professore") that cannot stand on its own but adds additional information about when or where the action took place. Both clauses contain all necessary elements for grammaticality, including proper subject-verb agreement and appropriate word order. Therefore, it is a grammatically acceptable sentence in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro crede che invaderemo quel paese" is grammatically correct. It consists of two clauses - one main clause "Alessandro crede", which means "Alessandro believes," and one dependent clause "che invaderemo quel paese", which means "that we will invade that country." In both clauses, verbs agree with their subjects in number and tense, making the whole sentence grammatically sound.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "quale" ("which") in questions that refer to subjective opinions or beliefs, it must be followed by the subjunctive mood. Here, "crede" should be in its subjunctive form "creda." Also, there shouldn't be an accent on the letter 'e' in "Andrea." Thus, the corrected sentence should read as follows: "A proposito di questi paesi, quale creda Andrea invaderanno?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rules of Italian grammar in terms of morphology, syntax, and semantics. The subject-verb agreement is maintained as "scriv**eva**" agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro." Additionally, the verb tense used correctly indicates that the action was ongoing in the past but does not continue into the present.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules for Italian syntax, morphology, and semantics. Here's a breakdown: - "L'anno scorso" means "last year." It is a common expression in Italian that refers to the previous year from when you are speaking or writing. - "Edoardo scrisse un libro" translates as "Edoardo wrote a book," which makes sense since it describes an action performed by one person in the past tense. - "Ma a tutt'oggi" can be translated as "but until today." This phrase indicates a contrast between what happened last year and what hasn't changed up until now. - "Non l'ha ancora finito" can be broken down into several parts: "non" meaning "not"; "l'" referring back to "un libro" ("a book"); "ha" being the third-person singular present indicative form of the verb "avere" ("to have"), indicating possession; "ancora" meaning "still" or "yet"; and "finito", the past participle of the verb "finire" ("to finish"). Together they mean "has not yet finished it."
0	Semantics	The sentence "I have three dog and two cat" is grammatically incorrect due to its inconsistent verb agreement with the subject-plural nouns ("three dogs", "two cats") but singular verb forms ("have"). A correct version could be "I have three dogs and two cats."
1	Correct	The sentence "L'attuale re di Francia è calvo." is grammatically correct. It means "The current king of France is bald" in English. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found in the given Italian sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Qualche studente ha superato l'esame." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Some student passed the exam" which makes sense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It can be translated as "If some student hasn't passed the exam, then every student hasn't passed the exam." Both parts of the compound sentence use the negative form correctly with "non" before the auxiliary verb "ha superato".
1	Correct	The sentence "Ieri ho promesso a Lorenzo di partire." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Yesterday I promised Lorenzo to leave." Each word is correctly conjugated for tense and number, and it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Nel processo di primo grado, la corte dichiarò l'imputato innocente." is grammatically correct. It follows proper Italian syntax rules with no morphological or semantic errors.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Continue like that and you will cause trouble." In English, we would use the subject pronoun "you" before the verb "will cause," but in Italian, as in many other languages, the subject pronoun can often be omitted when it is clear from context who or what the subject refers to. Here, the subject is implied by the conjugated form of the verb "combinerai" ("you will combine").
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho preso le chiavi." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I took the keys.", where "ho" is an auxiliary verb for past tense, "preso" is the past participle form of the verb "prendere" which means to take, "le" is the feminine singular direct object pronoun meaning them or these, and "chiavi" means keys.
0	Syntax	In the indirect speech, the verb in direct speech ("dice" in Italian) must agree with the subject in person and number. Therefore, it should be "ha detto" instead of "ha detto". Additionally, since the subject of the embedded clause is plural ("loro"), the verb "darete" should also be changed to its third-person plural form "daranno." Thus, the corrected sentence would be: "Andrea, trasmettendoci le commissioni della marchesa: 'Ha detto: "Daranno loro il buongiorno"""
0	Semantics	The sentence "Una bella casa fa comodo" is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect. In Italian, "comodo" means comfortable, but it requires an object or complement to indicate what is comfortable. A more appropriate way to say it could be "Questa casa è molto comoda", which translates to "This house is very comfortable".
1	Correct	The sentence "Prendiamo questo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "We take this one" or "Let's take this". Here, prendiamo is the first person plural form of the present tense of the verb prendere (to take). Thiscon consequently agrees with the subject in number and person. Therefore, no correction is needed for this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Uso il gladio." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I wield the sword.", where "uso" is the first person singular present indicative form of the verb "usare", meaning "to use". "Il gladio" is a noun phrase consisting of the definite article "il" and "gladio", which means "sword". Therefore, no grammatical mistakes were found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il calcolatore funziona bene." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The computer works well." In this case, "il" is a definite article that agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of "calcolatore," which is a noun meaning "computer." "funziona" is an third-person singular verb that means "works." And "bene" means "well".
1	Correct	The sentence "I would like to order a pizza with extra cheese" is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate prepositions.
1	Correct	The sentence "Le ragazze sono arrivate." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence means "The girls have arrived" and it follows all the rules for word order, verb conjugation, and agreement between subject and auxiliary verb.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il libro che mi ha prestato Lorenzo non mi piace" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The book that Lorenzo lent me I don't like." Each word follows proper morphological rules for gender, number, tense, etc., and they combine into a coherent syntactic structure with no semantic errors or ambiguities.
1	Correct	The sentence "Dicono che hai raccontato che non ci vediamo mai." is grammatically correct. It consists of two main clauses ("dicono" and "ci vediamo") connected by the subordinating conjunction "che", an embedded clause ("hai raccontato"), and another subordinating conjunction "che". All verbs agree with their respective subjects in number and tense, and the word order is also correct for a complex sentence in Italian.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Legge" means "reads", "velocemente" means "quickly". Therefore, without additional context, it can be interpreted as "Reads quickly."
1	Correct	The sentence "Andando a casa, ho incontrato tuo fratello." is grammatically correct. It means "On my way home, I met your brother." There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sto andando a prendere la macchina." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I am going to pick up the car.", where "sto" is the present participle form of the verb "stare", which here indicates an ongoing action.
1	Correct	The sentence "Non è vero che l'aspetto dei luoghi cambia come il volto degli uomini." is grammatically correct in Italian. It follows proper subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense usage. The negation "non" is correctly placed before the verb "è", indicating that what follows ("vero") is not true or accurate. Additionally, the nouns "luoghi" and "uomini" both agree with their respective adjectives "dei" and "degli," which indicate possession. Overall, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the imperative mood with a second person singular subject, the verb ending for regular verbs is "a". However, in this case, the subject seems to be two or more people ("you all" or "they"), so the verb form should reflect that by using the third person plural imperative which ends in "-ino", making it "Vadano a casa!" Instead of "Va' a casa!".
1	Correct	The sentence "Io sono affamato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I am hungry". Even though it might sound strange for native English speakers that the subject pronoun "io" (meaning I) is used together with the third person singular verb form "sono", this is perfectly fine in Italian grammar as long as the subject comes before the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence "Bravo, questo ragazzo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Bravo, this boy" in English. The word "bravo" is an adjective used to praise someone for their performance or action, while "questo" is a demonstrative determiner that refers to something near the speaker. The noun phrase "questo ragazzo" agrees with the third person masculine singular verb form "bravo". Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola è una donna che apprezziamo molto." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphological agreement between subject and verb, syntactical structure and semantic coherence. Here, 'Paola' is singular female name which agrees with third person present tense form of essere i.e., 'è', hence no error in morphology; also, the sentence structure appears fine as per syntax rule of Italian language without any misplaced words or phrases, thus no error in syntax; moreover, it conveys proper meaning too without any ambiguity indicating that it doesn't have any semantic issues either.
1	Correct	The sentence "Cosa fai domani?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "What are you doing tomorrow?" in English. This question only requires one verb form since it is asking about just one person's plans for tomorrow.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have seen the book that you gave me" in Italian is grammatically correct as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement, word order, and uses the appropriate tense for past actions. In particular, the verb "ho visto" agrees with the singular subject "io," and the relative clause "che mi hai regalato" correctly employs the past participle form "regalato." Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct without any errors or ambiguities.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gli amici il cui maestro è Andrea" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The friends whose teacher is Andrea." Here's a breakdown of the sentence: * "gli amici": these friends (masculine, plural) * "il cui": whose (relative pronoun introducing a relative clause; it agrees with the gender and number of the antecedent) * "maestro": teacher (masculine singular) * "è": is (third person singular of the verb "to be") * "Andrea": Andrea (name of a man)
1	Correct	The sentence "Credo che tu abbia ragione" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I believe you are right." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Siccome è caduto, si è fatto male." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this case, "siccome" means "since," which can introduce a subordinate clause that gives a reason for something. Here it refers to an earlier statement or situation implying that someone fell down and got hurt as a result. Both verbs agree with each other regarding tense and subject person, thus maintaining grammaticality throughout the whole sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Volevano distruggerla e l'hanno distrutta." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar, including morphological agreement between subject and verb conjugations as well as syntactical structure. In particular, the past tense verbs "volevano" and "hanno" agree with their respective subjects in number and gender, while the pronoun "la" correctly refers back to its antecedent.
0	Syntax	In the sentence "Ognuno prenda il suo cappotto," the error lies in the use of the reflexive pronoun "suo." Since "ognuno" means "everyone" or "each one", it requires a masculine singular reflexive pronoun "se" rather than "suo". Therefore, the corrected version would be "Ogniuno si prenda il suo cappotto."
1	Correct	The sentence "Prendimi quell'aggeggio." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Get me that gadget" or more literally "Take me that gadget". Here, "prendimi" is an impersonal form of the verb "prendere", which translates as "(you) take me". This form is used when addressing someone directly and asking them to perform an action on you. Hence, no subject agreement issues arise here.
1	Correct	The sentence "I gave the child milk, but he didn't drink it" is grammatically correct in English as each word is used appropriately, and the subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in it. Each verb agrees with its subject, both in number and tense. In particular, "usa" agrees with singular subject "Maria", while "sono" (in form of "so") agrees with the compound subject "io e te".
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho visto una casa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I saw a house." In this sentence, "ho" is an auxiliary verb used for first-person singular simple past tense, "visto" is the past participle form of the verb "vedere," which means "to see," and "una casa" is a noun phrase meaning "a house."
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho visto tua madre." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I saw your mother." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "La persona che mi ha parlato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The person who spoke to me". There are no mistakes in morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Se uno va in treno, vuole stare comodo." is grammatically correct. The subject-verb agreement is consistent as "uno" which means "one", agrees with the singular verb form "va". Also, the conditional tense "vuole" also agrees with the singular subject "uno". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in the given sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "avere" as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses with plural subjects, you need to use "hanno" rather than "fa". Therefore, in this case, it would be more appropriate to say "Fanno male le mie teste." This way, we maintain consistency by matching the plural subject ("le mie teste") with its corresponding auxiliary verb ("fanno").
0	Syntax	In Italian, when referring to multiple things or people using definite articles "il", "lo", "la", "l'", "i", "gli", "le" ("the" in English), we must use their plural forms which are "i", "gli", "le". Hence, "Ho due case." should be "Ho due case.", where "due" means "two" and "case" is the plural form for "casa" meaning "house".
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "avere" as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses with plural nouns or pronouns such as "Masha e Jane," we use "hanno" rather than "ho." Therefore, the corrected form of the given sentence would be "Hanno delle case."
1	Correct	The sentence "The horse arrived first" is grammatically correct in English. In this case, "the horse" is the subject of the sentence, which is doing the action of arriving, and "first" describes where or when it arrived relative to other horses. This structure follows standard English syntax rules for simple sentences with a single clause.
1	Correct	The sentence "I cavalli sono animali resistenti." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Horses are resilient animals" in English. Here, "cavalli" which refers to horses is the subject and it agrees with the verb "sono". Also, the word order follows SVO structure i.e., Subject-Verb-Object. Therefore, the given sentence is syntactically, morphologically, and semantically correct without any errors or ambiguities.
1	Correct	The sentence "È venuto qualcuno" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Someone came." In this case, "qualcuno" serves as a singular, masculine noun that functions as the subject of the sentence. Additionally, "è venuto" agrees with the third person singular subject in gender and number. Overall, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
0	Morphology	In Italian, when referring to multiple people or things, you need to use a plural form. In this case, "è" means he/she/it has arrived, but since we don't know exactly who arrived, it would be better to say "Sono arrivati." which means they have arrived in English.
1	Correct	The sentence "Posso venire." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "I can come" or "May I come?" in English. There is no subject-verb agreement issue here as the verb "posso" agrees with its implied singular subject ("io").
1	Correct	The sentence "Magari domani piove." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "If only it rains tomorrow" or "I wish it would rain tomorrow". There are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lui è stato colto dalla pioggia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He was caught by the rain." There are no mistakes regarding morphology, syntax or semantics.
0	Syntax	The verb "scrive" does not agree in number with its subject "Lei", which is singular. A correction would be "Scriva una lettera a sua zia." since -a is used for third person singular formal subjects.
1	Correct	The sentence "Egli lo vide." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He saw him." There are no mistakes in morphology, syntax, or semantics. The subject pronoun "egli" agrees with the verb "vide", as they both indicate third person singular masculine gender. Similarly, the object pronoun "lo" indicates third person singular masculine gender, which matches the direct object referent implied by the context.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: "Alessandro" is the subject who makes a promise ("promette") to his friend Edoardo ("ad Edoardo") that he will stay at home ("di restare a casa"). All words are correctly conjugated according to their grammatical function in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo non ha tempo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo doesn't have time" in English. Here, "non" is used as negation and "ha" is an auxiliary verb that indicates present tense and third person singular subject. "Tempo" refers to time. So, overall it forms a grammatically correct sentence without any morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho riparato il tavolo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I fixed the table". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make it ungrammatical.
1	Correct	The sentence "Hanno aperto il libro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "They opened the book.", where "hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere", used for compound tenses such as the present perfect tense here; "aperto" is the past participle of the verb "aprire"; and "il libro" is the direct object. All words agree with each other in number, gender, and grammatical function, making it a grammatically sound sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Le è stato dato il cappello da me." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here, "le" refers to indirect object pronoun for feminine singular or plural objects, "è stato" is third person singular passive voice of verb "stare" + past participle of "dare", which means "to give". Therefore, it can be translated as "He was given the hat by me" or "They were given the hat by me" depending on the context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quel ragazzo apre la porta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "That boy opens the door.", where "quel" is an adjective that refers to something previously mentioned or known by the speaker and listener, "ragazzo" is the subject which is singular masculine noun meaning "boy", "apre" is the third person singular verb form for present tense meaning "opens", and "la porta" is the direct object which is singular feminine noun meaning "the door".
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho sentito cantare i ragazzi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I heard the boys singing". The subject-verb agreement is correct as "ho sentito" which is in past tense form agrees with the singular subject, while "cantare" which is in gerund form agrees with the plural object "i ragazzi". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in the given sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "want" (volere) with a reflexive pronoun (lavarsi - to wash oneself), the subject-verb agreement requires that the verb form changes according to the gender and number of the subject. Here, since both Masha and Jane are females, we would use "vogliono" instead of "vuole". Therefore, the corrected sentence should read as follows: "La macchina vuole lavarle loro."
1	Correct	The sentence "È il meccanico che è venuto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It is the mechanic who came.", where "il meccanico" refers to one specific male mechanic. Both instances of "è" are auxiliary verbs used for the compound past tense ("passato prossimo") with the participle "venuto".
0	Syntax	In Italian, the verb "venire" requires the use of an auxiliary verb such as "essere" or "avere" in order to form a compound tense. Additionally, when using the auxiliary verb "essere," the past participle must agree with the subject in gender and number. Therefore, the sentence should read: "È venuto fino a Napoli che non voglio." which means "I don't want him/her/it to have come to Naples." However, it still doesn't make much sense even after fixing the grammar error because the meaning is unclear without additional context.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "mi" as an indirect object pronoun with a verb that takes a direct object pronoun ("lo," "la," or "li"), you need to use the double object pronoun form of the verb. So for "fa piacere," which means "it pleases," the double object pronoun form is "mi piece." Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Quanto al bagno, mi pieace." Since the original sentence does not follow this rule, it is syntactically incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence "Hai presente Lorenzo?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Do you remember Lorenzo?". Here, "hai" is the second person singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere", which is used here to form the compound past tense; "presente" is an adjective that functions as an adverbial expression meaning "familiar with".
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "da" with a question word such as "quando", it needs to be followed by the preposition "a". Therefore, the correct form would be "Da quand'a vive in America?" but still, informally people say "Quand'è che vivi in America?" or "Da quanto tempo vivi in America?".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in it. "Credi" agrees with its subject "tu," which is second person singular; "che" introduces a subordinate clause; "sia" is used as an auxiliary verb for the third person plural in the subjunctive mood ("una cosa del genere" refers to something unspecified); finally, the question mark at the end signals that this is an interrogative sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "che" as a relative pronoun after a verb in the indicative mood, the subjunctive mood must be used in the following clause. Therefore, "piangevo" should be "piangesse" and "volevo" should be "volessi". Additionally, since two actions were performed at the same time ("mi lasciò" and "piangevo"), it would have been more appropriate to use the imperfect tense for both verbs, making "piangevo" grammatically correct but semantically less precise. Here is the corrected version: Appena detto ciò, mi lasciò che piangessi e volessi dire molte cose.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sei sempre lo stesso: un amico fidato, paziente e onesto." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "You are always the same: a loyal, patient, and honest friend." The verb "sei" agrees with its singular subject "tu," which is understood but not explicitly stated. The adjectives after the nouns ("fidato", "paziente", and "onesto") follow standard agreement rules for gender and number, as they describe the single masculine noun "amico". Overall, it does not contain any morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il vento forte sul mare può provocare mareggiate." is grammatically correct. It means "A strong wind over the sea can cause storm surges.", where "vento" stands for "wind", "forte" describes its intensity, "sul" is a preposition indicating location ("on"), "mare" refers to "sea", "può" is an auxiliary verb used in the third person singular form of present tense, meaning "can", and "provocare" denotes "to provoke". Finally, "mareggiate" represents "storm surges".
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using an adverb such as "forte" with a verb, we need to use the bare infinitive form of the verb, not its gerund form. Here, you used "piangere forte," which is actually the correct way to say "to cry loudly." However, in English, it needs to be translated differently - by adding the auxiliary verb "do": "They do cry loudly." So, without that added auxiliary verb, the sentence becomes ungrammatical in English. A corrected version would be: - They cry loudly.
1	Correct	The sentence "I caught at home a kind of cat." is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause with a subject ("I"), a verb ("caught") and an object ("a kind of cat"). Additionally, it contains a prepositional phrase ("at home") that modifies the verb. All elements are syntactically well-structured and the meaning can be easily understood.
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho preso del denaro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I took some money.", where "del" is used before masculine singular nouns starting with a vowel or a z sound.
1	Correct	The sentence "Non mi piace il vino." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I don't like wine". There are no morphological or syntactical errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quel che vendo è merce cinese." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "What I sell is Chinese merchandise" or "The goods I sell are Chinese".
0	Syntax	The verb "mettere" agrees with its subject in number and gender. In this case, the subject is not explicitly stated in the sentence but it can be inferred from the context that it refers to multiple people or things. Therefore, the singular form of the verb "mettere" is incorrect. It should be "mettono" to agree with the plural subject. So, the corrected sentence would be "Mettono fretta.
1	Correct	The sentence "È stato bandito un concorso." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A competition has been banned." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tutte le balene devono essere protette" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "All whales must be protected." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The verb "mettitelo" requires an object pronoun as its direct object, but "bene" is an adverb, not a pronoun. A possible correction could be "Mettilo bene in testa." where "lo" refers to some previously mentioned masculine singular noun or concept. However, without additional context it is difficult to provide a more precise correction.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Questa macchina è vecchia ma nuova" is grammatically correct but semantically inconsistent. The word "questa" means "this one," which implies that only one item is being referred to. However, in the same sentence, we have two conflicting descriptions: old ("vecchia") and new ("nuova"). This creates a contradiction as something cannot be both old and new at the same time. To fix this issue, you could use different words for each description or clarify what aspect of the car is old versus new.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo non conosce Maria." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure where "Leonardo" is the subject, "non conosce" is the verb and "Maria" is the object. Also, the tense and agreement between the subject and the verb is consistent with the rules of Italian grammar.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il governo ha approvato il bilancio" is grammatically correct. It consists of three words: "il", which is a masculine singular definite article; "governo", which means government and agrees in number and gender with the article; and "ha approvato", which is the third person singular form of the verb "approvare". Therefore, it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho spazzolato le scarpe." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I cleaned the shoes" or "I brushed the shoes". Here, "ho spazzolato" is the first person singular present perfect tense of the verb "spazzolare", which means to brush or clean with a brush; and "le scarpe" is the direct object referring to "the shoes".
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso abita da dieci anni." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso has been living there for ten years". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been playing basketball for two hours" is grammatically correct in English. Here, "have been playing" represents present perfect continuous tense which indicates an action that started in the past and continues up until now. Additionally, the time expression "for two hours" correctly specifies how long the action has been happening.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria ha corso per ore" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence consists of two words: "Maria", which is a female name acting as the subject here, and "ha corso" - a conjugated form of verb "correre" meaning "to run". In particular, "ha corso" represents third person singular present tense, indicating that someone performed an action of running in the past. Since we have only one subject performing the action alone, it fits perfectly with our context. Therefore, I can confirm that no grammatical mistakes were found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco ha bevuto un caffè" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco had a coffee." Here's why it's correct: * "Francesco" is the subject and it agrees with the verb tense "ha bevuto," which indicates that the action occurred in the past. * "Ha bevuto" is the third person singular form of the verb "bere" (to drink) in the passato prossimo tense (compound past tense). In English, you would translate it as "he drank." * "Un caffè" is a masculine singular noun meaning "a coffee", so "un" is used before the word "caffe". This phrase functions as the direct object in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea ha trovato un biglietto per l'opera." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with the subject-verb-object structure: "Andrea" (subject) "ha trovato" (verb in past tense) "un biglietto per l'opera" (object).
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo sta compilando" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo is filling out". The subject "Edoardo" is singular and the verb "sta compilando" agrees with it in number and person.
0	Syntax	In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number and person. In this case, "emanare" which means "to emit" requires an "s" at the end when used with multiple subjects ("they"), so the correct form would be "emanano". Therefore, the sentence "Emanare profumo." should actually be "Esse emanano profumo.", assuming that both Masha and Jane are responsible for emitting the scent. However, without additional context it's unclear who or what is emitting the scent.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "To open a new store." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Iniziare un'attività." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "To start an activity.", where "un'attività" is a singular feminine noun that takes the article "una". Therefore, it requires the infinitive verb form "iniziare", making the whole phrase grammatically accurate.
1	Correct	The sentence "La porta si è chiusa." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun with singular third person verbs. In this case, "la porta" is the subject, which is feminine singular, and "si è chiusa" is the verb phrase, meaning "it has closed". Therefore, no correction is needed for this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele non ammette di essere preso in giro." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphology, syntax, semantics, and punctuation. Here, "Gabriele" is the subject who doesn't admit ("non ammette") something about himself which is expressed by the passive infinitive phrase "di essere preso in giro".
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola ha restituito il libro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola returned the book". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in it.
1	Correct	The sentence "Che cosa ha preso?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "What did they take?" or "What have they taken?" depending on context. Here, "che cosa" means "what," while "ha preso" is the third person singular form for "have taken." Since it is not clear how many people took something from just this sentence alone, using the third person singular makes sense as it can apply to one or more than one person.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lei mi aiuta con i compiti" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Lei" is a third-person singular feminine subject pronoun meaning "she." * "mi" is an indirect object pronoun that means "me." It shows who receives the action. * "aiuta" is the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "aiutare," which means "to help." This agrees with the subject "lei." * "con" is a preposition that indicates accompaniment or company. * "i compiti" refers to "homework." It is the direct object of the sentence and agrees with "compiti" as masculine plural noun.
1	Correct	The sentence "The days have shortened" is grammatically correct in English as it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order.
1	Correct	The sentence "Qualcosa ha accorciato le giornate." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Something has shortened the days." In this sentence, "qualcosa" is the subject which agrees with the singular verb form "ha". Also, "le giornate" is the direct object that agrees with the past participle "accorciato", as it refers to feminine plural nouns. Therefore, overall, the sentence structure follows the standard rules for syntax and agreement between words.
1	Correct	The sentence "Qualcuno ha accorciato le giornate." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Someone shortened the days.", where "someone" is the subject, "has shortened" is the verb in past tense, and "the days" is the direct object.
0	Syntax	This sentence is missing a main verb, making it incomplete and syntactically incorrect. Additionally, "aggrapparsi" requires an object or complement to complete its meaning. A possible correction could be "Si aggrapparono a un ramo," which means "They grabbed onto a branch."
1	Correct	The sentence "Arenatesi le navi, gli equipaggi sono scesi a terra." is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses "Arenatesi le navi" (The ships ran aground) and "gli equipaggi sono scesi a terra" (the crews went ashore). Both clauses have their own subject-verb agreement, which follows Italian grammar rules correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence "La nebbia è svanita." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The fog vanished" or "The mist disappeared". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in it.
0	Syntax	In Italian, reflexive verbs require that the pronoun matches the subject in number and gender. Here, "si" (third person singular) does not match with the plural subject "Alessandro". It should be "Si piangono sempre", or better yet, since it refers to oneself in first person, "Mi piano sempre."
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo si lagna sempre" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo always complains". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alle" is used as a contraction of "a le," which means "to the." "Sue" refers back to the feminine singular noun "parole" earlier in the sentence. Both "Maria" and "ha" agree in gender and number. Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "L'acqua è sgorgata all'improvviso." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The water gushed out suddenly." In this sentence, "l'acqua" which means "the water", serves as the subject and it agrees with the singular verb form "è". Furthermore, the adverb "all'improvviso" modifies the verb correctly by indicating when the action occurred. Overall, the syntax, morphology, and semantics of this sentence are consistent with standard Italian grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea ha sbadigliato?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Did Andrea yawn?" or "Has Andrea yawned?" depending on context. Here, "ha" is an auxiliary verb used for forming compound tenses with the main verb "sbadigliato". This question form is perfectly acceptable and commonly used in daily conversation.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo pedala" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules. In this case, both the subject ("Riccardo") and verb ("pedala", which means "cycles" or "pedals" in English) agree in singular form.
1	Correct	The sentence "È approfittato dell'esperienza." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence means "He took advantage of the experience" or "He benefited from the experience". It follows proper subject-verb agreement rules as well as other grammatical conventions for word order and usage in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il sole tramonta lentamente dietro la linea dell'orizzonte." is grammatically correct. It means "The sun sets slowly behind the horizon". All words agree with each other in terms of number and gender, word order is also correct. Therefore, it does not contain any morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quando iniziò il concerto, il figlio di Leonardo sedeva in prima fila." is grammatically correct. It means "When the concert began, Leo's son was sitting in the front row". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in it.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il muro ammuffisce in una giornata." is grammatically correct. It means "The wall mold grows in a day.", where "il muro" is the subject, "ammuffisce" is the verb that agrees with the singular masculine noun il muro, and "in una giornata" is an adverbial phrase indicating time.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola sta suonando un pezzo di Bach." is grammatically correct. It means "[Paola is playing a piece by Bach](https://context.reverso.net/translation/italian-english/sta+suonando+un+pezzo+di)". Each word in the sentence follows proper Italian grammar rules for morphology, syntax, and semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il coro canta molto bene." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The choir sings very well". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo aspirava sempre il fumo del sigaro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo always inhaled the smoke of the cigar." Each word follows proper grammar rules with respect to its conjugation based on tense, number, and gender.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea aspires to become a doctor." The subject of the sentence is "Andrea" which is singular and third person, so the present tense verb form "aspira" agrees with it. There isn't any morphological or syntactical error in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo non ha cucinato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo did not cook". There are no mistakes with morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "La lettera sta arrivando" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The letter is arriving". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes. The subject "la lettera" agrees with the third person singular present tense verb form "sta arrivando", which indicates that it is currently on its way.
1	Correct	The word "Disturbo" is an Italian noun that means "disturbance." It is grammatically correct as it stands alone in English text when referring to the concept of disturbance or disorder in general. However, its usage might not fit the intended context since it lacks further explanation or reference to specific details about what kind of disturbance is being referred to.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo sta compilando." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[He/She/You(formal)] is compiling". Since the subject is not explicitly stated in the sentence, it can refer to both masculine or feminine singular entities. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes have been identified in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo non scrive più da un pezzo." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules and word order for a declarative statement. It can be translated to English as "Riccardo hasn't written anything in a while," which also adheres to English grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il macchinista si è fermato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The train driver stopped himself" or simply "The train driver stopped". Here, "il macchinista" is a singular masculine noun that refers to the subject, "si" is a reflexive pronoun, "è" is an auxiliary verb for past tense, and "fermato" is the past participle form of the verb "fermare", which means "to stop".
1	Correct	The sentence "I negozianti hanno aumentato" is grammatically correct in Italian. This phrase means "The shopkeepers have increased." In Italian, it is not necessary to include an object for transitive verbs when the meaning can be understood from context. Here, "aumentare" is a transitive verb that does not need an explicit direct object. Therefore, the sentence is acceptable as-is with no changes needed.
1	Correct	The sentence "I bicchieri si sono rotti." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The glasses broke" or more literally "The glasses themselves have broken". This sentence consists of a subject ("bicchieri", which is plural) followed by an auxiliary verb ("si sono") and the past participle form of the verb "rompere" ("rotti").
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola ha acceso il fuoco." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola lit the fire.", where "ha" is an auxiliary verb used for past tense conjugations with feminine singular subject ("Paola"), and "il fuoco" is a noun phrase referring to "the fire".
1	Correct	The sentence "Il soggiorno in Canada ha migliorato il suo inglese." is grammatically correct. It means "Staying in Canada improved his English." There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "La lezione ha continuato." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this case, "lezione" which means lesson, is being treated as feminine singular noun and it agrees with its verb form "ha continuato". This verb form indicates third person singular, which matches our subject "la lezione", so no correction needed here.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using an infinitive verb as the main verb in a sentence with multiple subjects, you need to use "essere" (to be) as an auxiliary verb before the infinitive. So the correct form would be "Masha e Jane sono saltate un ostacolo." or "Masha and Jane jumped over an obstacle."
1	Correct	The sentence "I really appreciate what you did for me." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject "I", an adverb "really" that modifies the verb, an auxiliary verb "do" in past tense, the word "what", another auxiliary verb "have" also in past tense, the word "you", the word "did", and finally the phrase "for me". All elements are arranged according to English grammar rules and all verbs agree with their respective subjects in number and person.
1	Correct	The sentence "Si è macchiata la tovaglia." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun, "è" is an auxiliary verb meaning "is", "macchiata" is the past participle form of the verb "macchare" which means "to stain", and "la tovaglia" is the subject of the sentence which means "the tablecloth". Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated into English as "The tablecloth got stained.", which makes sense semantically.
1	Correct	The sentence "Macchie il vino." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He stains the wine" or "It stains the wine," depending on context. In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number and gender, but no explicit subject is necessary for a verb to have third-person singular form. Thus, "macchiare" can function as a third-person singular verb without an explicitly stated subject.
1	Correct	The sentence "L'acqua è gelata in due ore." is grammatically correct. It means "The water will freeze in two hours" in English. Here, "l'acqua" is a singular feminine noun that takes the definite article "la," but it becomes "l'" before a vowel sound ("è"). The verb "essere" (to be) agrees with its subject, which is "l'acqua," so we use "è." Finally, "due ore" refers to a time period of two hours during which the action of freezing occurs.
1	Correct	The sentence "Le tappe hanno bruciato per un'ora" is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "The stages have burned for an hour." Each word is correctly inflected or conjugated according to its role in the sentence, making it syntactically sound as well. Therefore, no specific category of grammatical error applies here.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il vetro si rompe." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The glass breaks" or "The windowpane breaks," depending on context. There is no morphological, syntactical, or semantic error in it.
1	Correct	The sentence "Ha verificato l'autenticità della firma." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He/She verified the authenticity of the signature" in English. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo lava la macchina." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo washes the car" in English. The subject-verb agreement is correct as "Riccardo" is singular and "lava" agrees with it in number. Also, the definite article "la" before "macchina" correctly indicates that "macchina" refers to a specific car.
1	Correct	The given sentence "Paola ha visto la partita con i suoi amici." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Paola" is correctly used as the subject of the sentence. * "ha visto" indicates that the action was performed by "Paola". This form agrees with the feminine singular subject "Paola", so it is also correct. * "la partita" refers to "the match" or "the game," which is appropriate for this context. It matches the gender and number of the subject too. * "con i suoi amici" means "with her friends." In English, you would say "my friend(s)" but in many other languages including Italian, possessive adjectives must agree with their noun in terms of gender and number. Thus, "i suoi" is the masculine plural version of "her" since "amici" is a masculine plural word. So, both words here are consistent with each other.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele si è tagliato le basette." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Gabriele" is a singular masculine noun that refers to a person. It serves as the subject of the sentence. * "si" is a reflexive pronoun used for first-person singular when the verb indicates an action performed on oneself. In this case, it agrees with the subject "Gabriele". * "è tagliato" is the third-person singular form of the present perfect tense of the verb "tagliare", which means "to cut". This part of the sentence describes what happened to "Gabriele". * "le basette" is a feminine plural direct object referring to sideburns or short hair near the ears. Overall, the structure and word choice of the sentence follow standard Italian grammar rules.
0	Morphology	In English, we use "doesn't" for third person singular subjects with verbs that start with a consonant sound in present simple tense. Therefore, it should be "She doesn't like spinach."
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is a singular masculine noun that requires the usage of the reflexive pronoun "si". The verbs "calmato" and "irrigidito" are both past participle forms that agree with the gender and number of "Francesco", which is masculine singular. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be identified in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "The dog chases its tail" is grammatically correct in English. Here, "dog" is the subject, which is singular, so we use the third person singular form of the verb "chase." Similarly, "its" is a possessive determiner that agrees with the singular noun "tail." Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, the verb form must agree with the subject in number and person. Here, the subject "you" ("tu" or "voi") is missing, resulting in an ungrammatical sentence. A possible correction could be "Vieni alla festa mangiato e bevuto." for singular "you", or "Venite alla festa mangiati e bevuti." for plural "you".
1	Correct	The sentence "Il dibattito è continuato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The debate was continued." In this sentence, "il dibattito" is the subject, which is masculine singular; hence, it agrees with the verb "è," which is also singular. Therefore, there is no morphological or syntactical error in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il dibattito ha continuato" is grammatically correct in Italian. Although it might seem that something is missing since "continuare" can also be used as an auxiliary verb for passive or reflexive constructions, here it functions as a regular verb meaning "to continue". Therefore, no additional elements such as "essere" ("to be") are required. In this case, "il dibattito" is the subject, and "ha continuato" represents the third-person singular form of the present tense indicative mood.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ha cancellato la scritta." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows all the rules for word order, verb conjugation, and agreement between subject and object. In particular, the third person singular present tense form of the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have) agrees with its subject "Riccardo", while the past participle "cancellato" agrees with its direct object "la scritta". Additionally, the word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), which is typical of declarative sentences in Italian. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo suona il telefono." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo rings the phone" or more naturally in English, "Leonardo is ringing the phone". There are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il livello si è alzato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The level has risen." In this sentence, "il" is an article used before masculine singular nouns, "livello" is the subject which means "level", "si" is a reflexive pronoun that agrees with the subject, "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere" meaning "to be", and "alzato" is the past participle of the verb "alzare" meaning "to raise". Therefore, the whole sentence translates as "The level has raised itself.", but it is commonly translated as "The level has risen."
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco ha bruciato la torta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco burned the cake.", where "ha" is an auxiliary verb used for forming compound tenses with the past participle "-ato", which agrees in gender and number with the object it refers to ("la torta"). In this case, since "torta" is feminine singular, we have "bruciata".
0	Morphology	In Italian, when using the verb "essere" (to be) with multiple singular nouns or pronouns in the third person, you need to use a plural form for agreement. Therefore, it should be "Edoardo e Giovanni sono pentiti." Instead of "Edoardo è pentito."
1	Correct	The sentence "Il bosco si è bruciato per tre ore." is grammatically correct. It means "The forest burned for three hours." Here's a breakdown of the sentence: - Il bosco = subject (the forest) - si è = reflexive verb form indicating that the subject performs an action on itself - bruciato = past participle of the verb "bruciare" (to burn) - per tre ore = time expression meaning "for three hours"
1	Correct	The sentence "La biancheria si è asciugata per un'ora." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("la biancheria" - the laundry) which agrees with the verb form "si è asciugata" in number and gender. This verb form means that something dried itself, since it uses reflexive pronoun "si". Finally, we have an adverbial phrase "per un'ora", meaning for an hour.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il libro è sparito per tre giorni, poi è improvvisamente ricomparso sul mio tavolo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The book disappeared for three days, then suddenly reappeared on my table.", where each word follows proper morphological agreement with its subject or object, and syntactically fits within the structure of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "The dog barks at every car that passes by" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a simple noun phrase ("the dog"), a present tense verb ("barks") and an adverbial clause ("at every car that passes by"). All elements are syntactically well-formed and semantically clear.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been working as a software engineer for three years" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English Subject-Verb-Object word order in which the subject comes first, followed by the verb, then the object. In this case, the subject is "I", the verb is "have been working", and the object is "as a software engineer for three years". Additionally, the tense of the verb agrees with the time frame expressed in the sentence ("for three years").
1	Correct	The sentence "Si è rotta la televisione in un'ora." is grammatically correct. It means "The television broke in an hour". Here, "si" is used as a passive reflexive pronoun which refers to "la televisione", indicating that something happened to it without specifying who or what caused it.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alle 8 in punto la sala si è svuotata." is grammatically correct. It means "At eight o'clock sharp, the room emptied out" in English. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in this Italian sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il treno si è un po' fermato." is grammatically correct. It means "The train stopped for a bit" in English. In Italian, "si" can serve as a reflexive pronoun or an impersonal passive form, both of which make sense in this context. Therefore, no grammatical errors were found.
1	Correct	The sentence "La camicia è sporca." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The shirt is dirty" in English. In this case, "la" refers to "camicia," which is feminine singular; "è" is an auxiliary verb used for third person singular in present tense; "sporca" is the adjective that agrees with the gender and number of the subject through its ending. Therefore, it follows all the rules related to morphology, syntax, and semantics correctly.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "avere" as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses, the past participle must agree in gender and number with the subject. Here, since both Masha and Jane are female, the past participle "notate" should be used instead of "notò". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Ho notate Masha e Jane che leggono lo stesso libro."
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro conosce le strade" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro knows the streets." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "approfittare" with multiple objects, you need to use the form that matches the object that comes last in the sentence. In this case, since the second object ("di Maria") uses the preposition "di", the first object ("Andrea") needs to take the form for indirect objects, which would require adding an article before it (in this case, "di"). A correct version of the sentence could be "Andrea approfita di lei".
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the present tense of the verb "amare" (to love) with third person singular subjects (like "Leonardo"), the correct form of the verb is "ama". However, in the sentence provided, it seems that the subject is not specified, so we don't know who is doing the action. To make the question clearer and grammatical, you could say "Chi ama Leonardo?" which means "Who loves Leoanrdo?" or specify the subject as I did in my previous explanation.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco è il capo" is grammatically correct. It means "Francesco is the boss." In Italian, singular masculine nouns that begin with stressed vowels require no article before them, so "il" can be omitted in front of "capo," but it does not change the grammaticality of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Trenta chili sono pesati da Alessandro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Thirty kilograms were weighed by Alessandro.", where "trenta" is an adjective modifying "chili", which together function as the subject of the sentence; "sono" agrees with the plural subject "trenta chili"; "pesati" is the past participle agreeing with the masculine singular direct object "chili". Therefore, no mistakes can be found here.
1	Correct	The sentence "Mio nonno ha venduto il suo podere." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar. The subject ("mio nonno") agrees with the verb ("ha venduto"), both in number and person. Also, the possessive adjective ("suo") matches the gender and number of the noun it refers to ("podere"). Therefore, I would say that the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "Due lingue sono parlate da tutti i miei studenti." is grammatically correct. It means "Two languages are spoken by all my students". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, the verb must agree in number with its subject, so for multiple subjects like "Otto" and "ore," the verb should also be plural. Therefore, it should be "studiano" instead of "sta studiata." Also, "da" should not be used here as it changes the meaning of the sentence; you can simply say "Otto ore al giorno studio con Tommaso" which means "I study eight hours a day with Tommaso".
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro trivella questa cosa." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order. Here, "Alessandro" is the subject, "trivella" is the verb, and "questa cosa" is the object. Additionally, the verb form agrees with the singular masculine subject "Alessandro".
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso torna da Roma" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso is returning from Rome". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error that I can identify in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco macina il caffè in un vecchio macinino" is grammatically correct. It means "Francesco grinds coffee in an old grinder". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso rubò il portafoglio a Maria in un autobus." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphology, syntax, and semantics. Therefore, it does not require any corrections.
1	Correct	The sentence "Dove Riccardo mise la cassa nel mobile?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Where did Riccardo put the case in the cabinet?" in English. The word order follows standard Italian syntax rules for questions, with the subject ("Riccardo") followed by the verb ("mise") and then the object ("la cassa"). Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated based on their grammatical function and number. Therefore, no errors were found in morphology or semantics either.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lo scoglio affiora" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The reef emerges." In this sentence, "lo" is a singular masculine definite article that agrees with the noun "scoglio," which is also singular and masculine. The verb "affiora" is in its third person singular form and agrees with the subject "lo scoglio". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "si" as a reflexive pronoun, it still needs an agreement with the subject in terms of number. Therefore, since "Andrea" is singular but feminine, while "Jane" is also singular but masculine, you cannot use "si". Instead, one could say "Loro si comportano", where "loro" refers to both of them and agrees in number.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo sottrae la penna" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo takes away the pen". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo toglie dalla cassaforte il giornale." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar in terms of morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, "Lorenzo" is the subject who performs an action on the direct object "il giornale". The verb form "toglie" agrees with the singular masculine subject Lorenzo. There are no obvious errors that can be detected without additional context or information about what was intended by the speaker/writer.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro legge un libro a letto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro reads a book in bed." Each word is correctly conjugated or used according to its grammatical function in the sentence.
0	Syntax	In English, articles ("the") come before adjectives, but in this sentence "the" comes before the noun "inuna tazzina di porcellana". It should be "in a cup of china" or "nel tazza di porcellana". Also, it seems that some words are missing from the sentence such as a verb indicating what Riccardo does with "il the", making the sentence ungrammatical.
1	Correct	The given sentence "Dov'è Andrea che ha preso una sigaretta?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Where did Andrea take a cigarette from?". In English, we would also say "take" rather than "pick up", so I assume that was just a small difference in translation between languages when you provided the example for me to check!
0	Morphology	In Italian, when referring to more than one third person singular subject (in this case "Tommaso" and "Jane"), we use conjugated verbs in their third person plural form. Therefore, it should be "estraevano" instead of "estrase". Also, as per syntax rules for coordinated phrases, both subjects connected by "e" ("and") need to agree with the verb tense used. Thus, a grammatically correct version would be: "Tommaso e Jane estraevano la pistola nel bar."
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ci mangia il riso." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "Riccardo" is the subject who eats "il riso" or rice with the help of "ci", which can have different meanings depending on context but here it implies that someone is eating something along with others. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes were found.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso vi sostiene la lastra" is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "Tommaso" is the subject who supports or holds up "la lastra", which means "the board". The pronoun "vi" refers to an indirect object that can indicate movement towards something or someone, but it could also simply mean "to you all" as a polite form when addressing multiple people. Overall, the sentence follows the standard rules for word order and agreement between words in terms of gender, number, and tense, making it acceptable according to Italian grammar.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence, which takes the third person singular form of the verb "prendere", which is "prese". The direct object is "il libro di storia" and the indirect object is "dalla libreria". Both objects take their proper forms according to grammatical gender and number agreement rules. Therefore, no mistakes were found in morphological, syntactic or semantic aspects of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo prende il libro dalla sala della biblioteca" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo takes the book from the library room." Each word follows the standard rules for conjugation and declension according to its role in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele mette le casse sul ripiano del montacarichi." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele puts the boxes on the loading platform tray.", where each word is correctly inflected for number, gender or tense as appropriate.
1	Correct	The sentence "Dove hai messo le foto di Francesco?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Where did you put Francesco's photos?". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso toglie i soldi dal cassetto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso takes the money out of the drawer". The subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "toglie", which is conjugated correctly for third person singular masculine form. Additionally, all other elements such as articles, prepositions, and nouns are used appropriately according to their grammatical gender and number. Therefore, I would consider it a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "La chiave sta nella toppa" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The key is in the hole." In this sentence, "la" is a feminine singular definite article that agrees with its noun "chiave," which is also feminine singular; "sta" is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "stare," meaning "to stay"; "nella" is a contraction of "in" + "la" (the preposition "in" plus the feminine singular definite article) used before words starting with an L or a vowel sound; and "toppa" is a feminine singular noun meaning "hole" or "patch". Therefore, the sentence structure, grammar, word choice, and agreement between subject and verb are all correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Dal giardino alla strada Lorenzo vi ha piantato i fiori." is grammatically correct. It consists of an adverbial phrase ("dal giardino alla strada") describing where the action took place; the subject ("Lorenzo"); the verb in past tense ("ha piantato") which agrees with the singular third person subject; and the direct object ("i fiori"). There are no grammatical errors or inconsistencies found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco ha lanciato il pallone dal balcone al giardino" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco threw the ball from the balcony into the garden." Each word agrees with other words in terms of number and gender as required by Italian grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Dal giardino ho visto un gatto nel cortile" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "dal giardino" means "from the garden", "ho visto" means "I have seen", "un gatto" means "a cat", and "nel cortile" means "in the courtyard". The subject-verb agreement is also correct - "ho" agrees with its singular subject "I". Therefore, it does not contain any grammatical mistakes in terms of morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo carica le casse sulla nave." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo loads the crates onto the ship.", where Edoardo is the subject, carica is the verb in third person singular present tense meaning "loads", le casse is the direct object referring to "the crates" and sulla nave is an adverbial phrase indicating "onto the ship".
1	Correct	The sentence "La scala poggia contro il muro" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The ladder leans against the wall". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "I rivoltosi incarcerarono Gabriele nelle segrete della fortezza." is grammatically correct. It means "The rioters imprisoned Gabriele in the fortress's dungeon." Each word is correctly conjugated or declined according to its role within the sentence, and it follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "chiuse", meaning "closed". "Giulia" is the direct object, as shown by the use of "dentro la stanza" ("in the room") indicating where Giulia was placed.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "chiudere" (to close) with the direct object being "il denaro" (the money), you need to use the third person singular form "chiude". However, in English, since "money" is uncountable, we would typically say "They closed the money." or more naturally, "They handled over the money.", which changes the verb used entirely. So either way, the original sentence cannot directly translate into proper English while preserving grammaticality.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele dette appoggio al libro." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure for expressing an action performed by a subject on an object using a verb. In this case, "Gabriele" is the subject who gave support ("dette appoggio") to the book ("al libro").
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence and "dette" is the past tense form of "dare," which means "to give." "Appoggio" means "support" and it agrees with the direct object pronoun "alla," which refers to "diffusione del libro" or "the spread of the book." Therefore, the structure of the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo caricò il camion." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows all the rules related to morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, "Lorenzo" is the subject who carried out an action denoted by the verb "carico", which agrees with the gender and number of its subject. Furthermore, "il camion" denotes the direct object that received the action expressed by the verb. Overall, the sentence structure is also appropriate for expressing such meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence "Questo latte deterge le impurità dal volto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "This milk cleans the impurities from the face". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo stipò l'armadio con i vestiti." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo filled the wardrobe with clothes". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "She have two cats." is grammatically incorrect in English due to subject-verb agreement error. In present tense, for third person singular, we use base form of verb (have) with s or es at the end. So it should be "She has two cats."
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been waiting for you." is grammatically correct in English. Here, "have" is used as an auxiliary verb in the present perfect tense, followed by the past participle form of the main verb "wait", which is "waited". Additionally, subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence with the singular subject "I" and its corresponding singular verb "have".
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of three simple sentences where each one contains a subject ("Francesco", "la statua" and "una tela di lino") and its corresponding verb ("avvolge"). There are no apparent morphological or syntactical errors that would make it ungrammatical.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence and he is accompanying "Sofia" to the movies, as indicated by "accompagna." Both names agree with their respective verbs in number and gender.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea accompagnò Paola a scuola." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea accompanied Paola to school". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "non" with a verb that uses "stare", we need to use the auxiliary verb "sto" for first person singular, but in this case, since the subject consists of multiple books ("libri"), the auxiliary verb should be "stanno". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "I libri non stanno nell'armadio."
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea atravesó la parte menos peligrosa del río" is grammatically correct in Spanish. It means "Andrea crossed the least dangerous part of the river." Each word follows the standard rules for conjugation and declension according to their respective roles in the sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "che" as a conjunction to introduce subordinate clauses that express intention or will, you need to use the present tense in the main clause and the infinitive form of the verb in the subordinate clause. Therefore, it should be "Ho intenzione di vestirmi da sposa." instead of "Ho l'intenzione che mi vestirò da sposa".
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco mangiava il pane con soddisfazione." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco was eating the bread with satisfaction.", where "mangiava" is the third person singular past tense of the verb "mangiare", which agrees with the subject "Francesco".
1	Correct	The sentence "Quella mattina pioveva a dirotto" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It was raining hard that morning." In this sentence, "quella mattina" refers to "that morning", while "pioveva a dirotto" describes the rain as being heavy or intense. Both parts of the sentence follow standard Italian grammar rules for word order, tense agreement, and adverb usage, making it an acceptable sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il vino beve Alessandro." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence translates to "The wine drinks Alessandro" which may seem semantically odd but it can still be considered grammatically valid. However, depending on context, you might want to say "Alessandro beve il vino." if you mean that Alessandro is drinking the wine.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco ha telefonato e Maria è venuta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco called and Maria came.", where "ha telefonato" is the past tense form of "to call", indicating that Francesco performed the action, while "è venuta" indicates that Maria arrived or came. Both verbs agree with their respective singular subjects "Francesco" and "Maria".
1	Correct	The sentence "Quel libro è stato dato a Paola da Gabriele." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "That book was given to Paola by Gabriele". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make it ungrammatical.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola riceve quel libro da Riccardo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola receives that book from Riccardo." Each word is correctly inflected for number, gender, or tense as appropriate. There are no missing words, extra words, or awkward phrasings. Therefore, it can be considered a grammatical and acceptable sentence in standard Italian.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when we have multiple singular subjects that perform the same action, we use a singular subject form and a plural verb conjugation. Hence, "Andrea e Jane mangiano un polpo" would be the grammatically correct way to express "Andrea and Jane eat an octopus".
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso mangia questo." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and proper agreement between the singular subject ("Tommaso") and its corresponding verb form ("mangia").
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia lo adora." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules. Here, "Sofia" is the subject and "adora" is the verb which means "adores". Since the third person singular masculine direct object pronoun "lo" comes before the verb, it indicates that the action is being done towards a male entity. In this case, since the subject is female, we would typically expect an indirect object or no object at all for such verbs. However, using "lo" with feminine nouns can sometimes occur in colloquial speech, especially when referring to females who have strong masculine traits. So, while not entirely ungrammatical, its usage might sound informal or unusual depending on context. Nonetheless, without further information about the intended meaning or style, I will assume that it is grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "L'artrosi ha paralizzato le ossa." is grammatically correct. It consists of one main clause where artrosi (arthritis) is the subject, which causes an action in the past on the object le ossa (the bones). There is no grammatical or syntactical error in this sentence; therefore, it is acceptable as it stands.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "vuole" which means wants, it must be followed by a singular noun or pronoun as it refers to only one thing being wanted. However, in this case, "lo" is singular while "mangiare" requires a plural direct object ("li"). It would be more appropriate to say "Maria vogliono mangiarli", since "vogliono" means they want and can take a plural direct object such as "mangiarli".
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo ammira Alice." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows subject-verb-object word order, with each element agreeing in number and gender. Here, both the subject ("Lorenzo") and verb ("ammira" - third person singular form of "to admire") are masculine singular; the object ("Alice") is feminine singular. Therefore, no grammatical errors can be identified in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been working as a software engineer for three years" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English. The verb tense "have been working" indicates that the action started in the past and continues up until now. Additionally, the use of the preposition "for" followed by the length of time "three years" correctly expresses the duration of the action.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo mira alla presidenza." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo looks at the presidency". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "È sul letto che Maria salta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It is on the bed that Maria jumps." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "subito che" (as soon as) with multiple simple tenses in a row, you need to use "sono" instead of "e". Therefore, the correct version would be "È subito che Edoardo **sono** vogliono il caffè." However, even after making that change, it still wouldn't sound natural since we usually don't use "subito che" between two actions performed by the same subject. A better way to express this idea could be "Appena si sveglia, Edoardo subito vuole un caffè", which means "As soon as he wakes up, Edoardo immediately wants coffee."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "tenere" (to hold) with an impersonal direct object indicator "ci", the subject-verb agreement requires that the form of the verb used corresponds to the gender and number of the subject. In this case, since both "Masha" and "Jane" are female singular names, the correct form of the verb would be "tiene" in feminine singular form, rather than "ciò" which is a neuter singular demonstrative pronoun. Therefore, the corrected sentence should read: "È al successo ciò che Masha e Jane tengono." or more naturally: "Sia Masha sia Jane aspirano al successo." where "aspirare" means "to aspire".
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used here as an auxiliary verb for future tense, followed by "alla presidenza", which means "to the presidency". "Che" introduces a subordinate clause with the infinitive form of the verb "mirare" that completes the meaning of "mira". Therefore, no grammatical errors can be identified in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo adora il cinema." is grammatically correct in Italian. It consists of a proper noun as subject ("Riccardo"), an auxiliary verb ("adora") that agrees with the subject in gender and number, and the definite article ("il") followed by a masculine singular noun ("cinema"). Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be detected here.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "It is the cinema that Francesco loves." In Italian, it is common to omit the subject pronoun when it can be inferred from context or verb endings. Here, "Francesco" is the subject, which is clear from the verb form "adora," so no subject pronoun ("egli," "lui," etc.) is needed before it.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct. "È" is used as a third-person singular form of the verb "essere" which means "to be." It agrees with its subject "il cinema," which is also singular. Therefore, no grammatical error can be found in this sentence regarding morphological agreement or syntax.
1	Correct	The sentence "I denti di Emma battono dal freddo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Emma's teeth chatter from the cold" which makes sense semantically as well.
0	Syntax	In Italian, an object pronoun such as "le" needs to agree with both the gender and number of the noun it refers to. Here, since "donne" is feminine plural, the object pronoun should also be in its plural form "le". Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Alessandro **le** adora che abbiano **gambe** lunghe **le** donne."
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" takes third person singular verbs, so "ne adora" is appropriate here. It means "Andrea loves her friends."
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele mangia un gelato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele eats an ice cream". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in it.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo promises Riccardo that he will come" is grammatically correct in English. It contains a subject ("Riccardo"), a verb ("promises"), an indirect object ("Riccardo"), and a dependent clause with its own subject and verb ("that he will come"). There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il polpo viene divorato dalla piovra." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The octopus gets eaten by the squid.", where "il polpo" is the subject, "viene" is an auxiliary verb used with passive voice, "divorato" is the past participle form of the verb "divorare", "dalla" is a contraction for "da la" and "piovra" is the object that performs the action expressed by the verb.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "ne" as a pronoun that refers back to a previously mentioned noun or noun phrase, it must agree in number with the antecedent. However, in this sentence, "ne" does not match the plural form of its antecedent "tolleranza." Therefore, the sentence is syntactically incorrect. A corrected version would read: "La tolleranza **ne** esulgono dai loro doveri."
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ci viene da Roma." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo comes from Rome to us.", where "ci" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to "us".
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea pensa a Paola." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea thinks about Paola," where both names refer to feminine singular nouns. Therefore, the third-person singular conjugation of the verb "pensare" (to think) must be used here.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia accompanies Maria to China" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order.
1	Correct	The sentence "Emma and the movie they saw themselves" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of two independent clauses - "Emma saw herself" and "[They] saw the movie" - connected by a conjunction ("and"). Both subject-verb agreement and word order are consistent with standard English usage.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject that is admiring ("ammira") an object which is "la casa." The clause "che è di Paola" gives more information about the house by indicating ownership.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using an indirect object pronoun such as "involuntarily absorbs" (assorbe), it must agree in number with its direct object. Here, the direct objects are "Beatrice" and "Francesco," which are both singular masculine or feminine nouns depending on their gender. However, since the verb form used here ("assorbe") is for third-person singular subjects, it does not match either subject. To fix this error, you can use "assorbono" instead, making the corrected sentence: "Beatrice e Francesco si assorbono involontariamente." This version uses the third-person plural conjugated form of the verb, indicating that more than one person is involved.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo distribuisce mattoni" is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "distribuisce" is the third person singular form of the verb "distribuire", which means "to distribute". Therefore, it agrees with its subject "Lorenzo". Moreover, "mattoni" is the plural form of "mattone", so it is also appropriate for the meaning of the sentence, where multiple bricks are being distributed by Lorenzo.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "dipingere" (to paint) in present tense with third person singular subject, it requires an auxiliary verb "è" (is). However, for compound tenses such as passato prossimo, you would need both "essere" and the past participle form of the verb. Therefore, assuming that you want to express a simple action happening now or in general, the correct version of the given sentence would be "Riccardo dipinge è bello." But since I know you intended to use the compound past tense, the corrected sentence would be "Riccardo ha dipinto è bello," which is still ungrammatical due to missing subject-verb agreement. It should be "Riccardo ha dipinto è stato bello" where "stato" agrees with the gender and number of the subject "Riccardo".
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia passeggia per Venezia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sophia walks around Venice" in English. The subject Sophia is singular and the verb passeggia agrees with it in number and person.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria raccoglie sassolini" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Mary collects pebbles". There are no mistakes with morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Giulia legge" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "legge" agrees with its singular subject "Giulia". In other words, since "Giulia" is feminine singular, we use the third person present tense singular form of the verb "leggere", which is "legge". Therefore, the sentence means "Giulia reads."
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice scherma con abilità." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice fences with skill." In this case, the subject "Beatrice" is singular and the verb "scherma" agrees with it both in number and person. Additionally, the preposition "con" followed by "abilità" indicates that she performs the action with some kind of ability or skill. Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Portuguese, when using the verb "travestir" which means "to disguise", it requires the use of the pronoun "ela" or "eles". Therefore, since both names used in the sentence are feminine, we need to use "elas" as the subject. Also, the correct form of the present tense for third person plural is "travestem-se". So, the corrected version would be: "Maria e Alice se travestem."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using third-person singular or plural pronouns as subjects in a sentence, we must use corresponding verbs accordingly. For instance, "Emma" and "Edoardo" require a verb that ends with "-a" for feminine singular, "-o" for masculine singular. However, the verb "umiliare" requires an object, which changes its ending depending on gender and number. Here, you need to add "-e" at the end of the verb since both subject nouns are singular but different in gender ("Emma" - feminine; "Edoardo" - masculine). Therefore, it should read "Emma umilia Edoardo." But, keep in mind that adding an article before each name would make the sentence more natural: "La Emma umilia l'Edoardo".
1	Correct	The sentence "Il sole sorge alle tre" is grammatically correct. In Italian, "il sole" means "the sun", "sorge" means "rises or gets up", and "alle tre" means "at three". So, the whole sentence can be translated as "The sun rises at three."
0	Morphology	In Italian, adjectives need to agree with the noun they modify in gender and number. In this case, "nuovi" (new) needs to match the feminine singular form, which is "nuova". So the correct sentence would be "La mia nuova macchina."
0	Syntax	In Italian, verbs must agree in number and person with their subject. In this case, "dormicchia" which comes from the verb "dormire" means "to sleep" but it is used for first person singular only ("I"). However, the subject "Alessandro" is second person masculine singular. Therefore, the right form of the verb that needs to be used is "dormici" or even better "dorme". So, an acceptable version could be: "Alessandro dorme nell'inazione più totale."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "non" with compound tenses such as passato prossimo, it must come before the auxiliary verb ("avere" or "essere") rather than after it. Therefore, the correct form would be "La maionese non è riuscita a prendere bene."
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria sorride a Giulia." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-indirect object structure where "Maria" is the subject, "sorride" is the verb, and "a Giulia" is the indirect object. All words agree with each other in number and gender.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using an indirect object pronoun such as "ad" with a verb that takes an accusative direct object, you need to use the clitic form of the preposition before the verb. So in this case, it would be "A quella (persona)" or just "Ad essa". Therefore, the corrected version of the given sentence will be: "Quel vestito non va ad essa."
1	Correct	The sentence "Il capitale dell'azienda ammonta a molti miliardi." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("il capitale dell'azienda") which means "the capital of the company" in English, followed by a verb ("ammonta") meaning "amounts", and an object complement ("molti miliardi"), which means "many billions". This structure follows standard Italian grammar rules for sentence formation.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A star shines in the sky." Each word follows standard Italian grammar rules for conjugation and syntax.
1	Correct	The sentence "Una stella brilla nel cielo" is grammatically correct. It means "A star shines in the sky". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Una stella scintilla nel cielo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A star twinkles in the sky". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "The cat sat on the mat." is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate articles ("the") with both nouns.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice arde dalla passione" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice burns with passion". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola luccicava dall'emozione." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola was shining with emotion." In this sentence, "luccicava" which is the third person singular form of the verb "luccicare", agrees with its subject "Paola". Therefore, no grammatical mistakes have been identified.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quell'idea si fa chiara nel suo animo." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Quell'idea" means "that idea," which agrees with the singular feminine gender noun "idea." * "si fa" is a reflexive verb meaning "it becomes" or "gets clearer" in English. It agrees with the subject "idea." * "chiara" is an adjective that describes "idea" as being clear, and it also matches the gender and number of the noun. * "nel suo animo" translates to "in her soul" or "in her mind," where "suo" refers back to "her." Both words agree with their respective genders and numbers.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele vi ritorna" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele returns to you". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo giunge in casa." is grammatically correct. It consists of one independent clause where "Riccardo" is the subject and "giunge in casa" is the verb phrase. In this case, "giunge" means "arrives". Therefore, it can be translated as "Riccardo arrives home.", which makes sense and follows all grammar rules for Italian language.
1	Correct	The sentence "La scala scende in cantina." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Scala" means staircase or ladder, which can be feminine singular in Italian. * "Scende" is the third-person singular form of the verb "scendere," meaning to go down or descend. It agrees with "la scala" as its subject. * "In" is a preposition that indicates movement towards an interior location. * "Cantina" refers to a cellar or wine storage room, so it implies going inside somewhere. This word is also feminine singular, agreeing with "in."
1	Correct	The sentence "Il sentiero ci arriva." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The path arrives here" or "The path reaches us". In this sentence, "il sentiero" is the subject which is singular masculine noun, so it agrees with its verb "arriva", which is also singular masculine form. Also, pronoun "ci" is used correctly as an indirect object pronoun meaning "to us" or "here". Therefore, no grammatical mistakes were found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "La maggioranza patteggia con l'opposizione." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The majority reaches an agreement with the opposition." In this case, "la maggioranza" is a feminine singular noun referring to the group that holds more than half of the seats in a legislative body, while "patteggia" is the third person plural form of the verb "patteggiare," which means "to reach an agreement or plea bargain." Additionally, "con" is a preposition meaning "with," and "l'opposizione" refers to the political party or coalition opposed to those currently holding power. Overall, all elements in the sentence agree in number and gender, making it grammatically acceptable.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "essere" (to be) with multiple singular nouns or pronouns such as in this case with "Emma" and "Lotta," we use the third person plural form "sono." Therefore, it should be "Emma e Lotta sono d'accordo su questo punto," which translates to "Emma and Lotta agree on this point."
1	Correct	The given sentence "Riccardo taglia il pane a fette." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo cuts the bread into slices". Here's why it's correct: - "Riccardo" is correctly conjugated as the subject of the sentence. - "taglia" agrees with the subject in number and person and accurately reflects that Riccardo is performing an action on something else. - "il pane", being masculine singular, matches common usage for referring to bread. - "a fette" is correctly used here to mean "into slices," indicating how the bread is being cut by the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo gli vide il volto." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "Riccardo" is the subject who performed an action on someone else ("gli", which refers to a masculine singular indirect object) by seeing their face ("il volto"). This structure follows standard Italian syntax rules for expressing transitive verbs with multiple arguments.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il sarto ha confezionato un vestito di lino." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Il sarto" means "the tailor," which is a singular noun that requires an article ("il") before it. * "ha confezionato" is the third person singular form of the verb "to have concealed," indicating that the subject of the sentence performed this action. In this case, the subject is "il sarto." * "un vestito" is a singular masculine noun meaning "a dress". It agrees with the following determiner "di lino", another singular masculine noun meaning "of linen". So overall, the sentence is grammatically correct as each word is correctly conjugated according to its role in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso ha edificato una palazzina nel centro di Roma." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar in terms of morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, we have a simple declarative sentence with a subject ("Tommaso") followed by the auxiliary verb "ha" for past tense, then the main verb "edificato", an object "una palazzina", and finally a prepositional phrase "nel centro di Roma". All elements agree in gender, number, and person as required by Italian language rules. Therefore, it can be considered as grammatically acceptable.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "essere" as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses with multiple subjects, it must agree in number with those subjects. Therefore, "Andrea sono" should be "Andrea sono". However, since we only have one subject here ("Andrea"), the sentence is actually grammatically correct, but I suspect that you meant to include another subject along with "Andrea." So my response assumes that context. In case the intention was to use the singular form "brutto", then both "Andrea" and "Alice" would become indirect objects through the usage of "a," making them "a Andrea" and "a Alice." Here's how the corrected version might look: Corrected Sentence: "Andrea è bruta con Alicia." This correction ensures grammatical agreement between the subject and its predicate adjective while preserving the original intent of conveying some sort of unpleasantness associated with Andrea towards Alice.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il Giappone colonizzò la Manciuria." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this case, "Il Giappone" is the subject of the sentence, which means "Japan" in English. It is correctly written with an initial capital letter and masculine singular definite article "il". Similarly, "la Manciuria" is also correctly written as feminine singular definte article "la" followed by the noun "Manciuria", which refers to Manchuria in English. Additionally, the verb form "colonizzò" agrees with both the subject "Il Giappone" and past tense requirement, meaning Japan colonized or took control over Manchuria respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the given sentence is grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo hatte Pakete unten an der Bibliothek gestapelt." is grammatically correct in German. It means "[Leonardo] had stacked packages at the bottom of the library". The subject ("Leonardo") agrees with the verb tense ("hatte"). There are no apparent morphological or syntactical errors in word choice or agreement, making it a suitable sentence for communication purposes.
1	Correct	The sentence "I enjoy playing soccer" is grammatically correct. Here, "enjoy" is a verb that takes an object complement ("playing soccer"), which follows the pattern of many English verbs taking direct objects. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent with the singular subject "I".
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo ci aveva ammassato pacchetti." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo had stacked up packages for us.", where "ci" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to "us".
1	Correct	The sentence "L'avaro accumula ricchezze." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The miser amasses wealth.", where "l'avaro" is the subject and "accumula" is the verb that agrees with it. Also, "ricchezze" as the direct object correctly agrees with the singular subject through the use of third person singular form "accumula". Therefore, no grammatical mistakes were found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo è importante per noi." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules and uses proper prepositions.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il sergente sta passeggiando nel parco" is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian syntax, morphology, and semantics. Here, "il sergente" is the subject in singular form and "sta passeggiando" is its present continuous tense verb which means he is taking a walk in the park.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia separated the work into two distinct parts" is grammatically correct. It follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules, where the singular third person present tense form of the verb ("separated") agrees with its singular subject ("Sofia"). Additionally, the word order is appropriate, making it a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola gli carezzò il volto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola gently touched his face". In this sentence, "gli" is used as an indirect object pronoun referring to "his face", while "il volto" is the direct object. This usage is acceptable and understandable in context.
0	Gender Agreement	In Italian, adjectives and past participle verbs must agree in gender with the noun they refer to. In this case, "questa" is feminine singular but "situazione" is feminine plural, so the verb "complicare" needs to match the plural form. A correct version would be "Queste situazioni gli complicano la vita."
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria afferrò la mano di Lorenzo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria grabbed Lorenzo's hand". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Questa medicina coagula il sangue." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "This medicine coagulates blood.", where "questa" refers to "this", "medicina" means "medicine", "coagula" is the third person singular form of the verb "coagulare" which means "to coagulate", and "il sangue" is "blood". All words agree with each other in gender and number as required by grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo forgi l'acciaio." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo hammers the steel.", where "forgi" is the third person singular form of the verb "fornire", which changes to "forgi" before "l". So no mistakes found here.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia cucina il pollo al limone." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "Sofia" is the subject who is cooking "il pollo al limone," which means "the chicken with lemon" in English. It follows standard SVO word order where "Sofia" acts as the subject, "cucina" functions as the verb, and "il pollo al limone" serves as the object.
1	Correct	The sentence "Le donne partoriscono i bambini." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The women give birth to children" and follows all the rules for morphology, syntax, and semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola converte lo zucchero in caramelle." is grammatically correct. It means "Paola turns sugar into candies". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il governatore incontra i ministri" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("il governatore") which is singular masculine, followed by a verb ("incontra") that agrees with it in number and gender, and an object ("i ministri") which is also grammatically correct. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In French, when using the negation "ne" with a verb, it must always be followed by another negative element in modern French. Here, only "ne" is present but not its corresponding second negative element ("pas", "plus", etc.). Therefore, the sentence "Alice ne travestit Francesco." would be more appropriate for modern French.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ne liberò il cane." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows all the rules of morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, "ne" is an adverb used to indicate that something was freed from something else, "liberò" is the past tense form of the verb "liberare", which means "to free". "Il cane" is a singular noun meaning "the dog". So overall, the sentence translates to "Riccardo freed the dog.", which makes sense both syntactically and semantically.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lo Stato accorda troppa fiducia all'amministrazione pubblica." is grammatically correct. It follows Italian syntax rules with no morphological or semantic errors. The subject "lo Stato" agrees with the verb "accorda", and the prepositional phrase "all'amministrazione pubblica" correctly modifies the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso attribuì la decisione di andare in Cina a Leonardo." is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause with the subject "Tommaso", the verb "attribuì" in its past tense form, and the direct object "la decisione". Furthermore, it contains an adverbial subordinate clause starting with "di andare" that specifies the content of the decision, and an indirect object "a Leonardo" indicating who the decision was attributed to.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo addebitava il suo insuccesso alla decisione del padre di andare in Francia." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphological agreement between subject and verb, syntactical structure, and semantic coherence.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco leaves his wife on the road." Each word is spelled correctly, agrees with other words in terms of number and gender, and fits into its proper place within the structure of the sentence according to Italian syntax rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "I ladri rubano le auto ai legittimi proprietari." is grammatically correct. It means "The thieves steal cars from the legitimate owners." In Italian, nouns and pronouns have grammatical gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). Verbs must agree with their subject in person and number. Here, the verb "rubano" agrees with its plural masculine subject "i ladri". Also, the definite article "le" before "auto" correctly matches the feminine gender of "auto", and "ai" correctly shows that "proprietari" is plural and masculine.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria spalmò il pane con il coltello." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here, "spalmò" is the third-person singular past tense form of the verb "spalmare", meaning "to spread". Therefore, it agrees with the subject "Maria" which is also singular. Additionally, all other elements of the sentence such as the article "il" before "pane" and "coltello" agree with their respective nouns in gender and number. Hence, the overall structure of the sentence seems appropriate.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "misere" (to put) with two objects, as in this case, where the table is being covered by a hat, we need to use the double object construction "misero il cappello sul tavolo". Therefore, the correct form would be "Riccardo mise il cappello sul tavolo."
1	Correct	The sentence "L'aviazione nemica bombardò napalm sulla città." is grammatically correct. It consists of a single independent clause with the subject "l'aviazione nemica" ("the enemy aviation") followed by the verb in past tense "bombardò" ("bombed"). The direct object "napalm" comes next, followed by the preposition "sulla" ("on") and its complement "città" ("city"). All elements agree in number and gender as required by Italian grammar rules.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Andrea imbeve il pane di vino" is semantically incorrect because it translates to "Andrea soaks the bread of wine," which does not make sense in English or Italian. A more appropriate translation for "Andrea soaks the wine bread" would be "Andrea inzuppa il panbrioche."
1	Correct	The sentence "Raso rosso foderava i cuscini." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Red satin was upholstering the cushions," which makes sense in English as well. There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo dissemina aneddoti divertenti nei suoi racconti." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo sprinkles funny anecdotes in his stories.", where "Lorenzo" is the subject who performs the action of "disseminare" (to spread) on the direct object "aneddoti divertenti" (funny anecdotes). This phrase appears in the accusative case, which agrees with the verb tense used - passato prossimo or present perfect tense. Finally, the prepositional phrase "nei suoi racconti" indicates that the anecdotes appear within his stories.
1	Correct	The sentence "I turisti disseminano il prato di cartacce." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The tourists scatter the lawn with litter," where "turisti" is the subject in plural form, "disseminano" is the verb that agrees with the plural subject, "il prato" is the direct object, and "di cartacce" provides more information about what is being scattered on the lawn.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because "il figlio" should agree in number with "l'idea". It should be "la figlia dell'ideA", or better still, "l'idea della bambina". Also, it would sound more natural to say "Gabriele si vantava di essere...", since "nutrirsi" means "to feed oneself" rather than "to boast about something".
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo liberò il cane dalle catene." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule with the singular verb form "liberò" agreeing with its singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, all words are used appropriately according to their meaning and function in the sentence, making the overall semantic interpretation coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro scarica Giulia dalle proprie responsabilità." is grammatically correct. It means "Alessandro frees Julia from his own responsibilities". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in it.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso ne ottiene la libertà." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso obtains freedom from it" or more loosely translated as "Tommaso gets his freedom". Here's why: - "Tommaso" is correctly written and inflected for masculine gender singular subject. - "ne" is a pronoun used here to refer back to some antecedent mentioned earlier in the conversation. Its usage is appropriate based on context. - "ottiene" is the third person singular form of verb "ottenere", meaning "to obtain". This matches our subject "Tommaso". - "la libertà" is feminine gender singular definite article + noun combination, which agrees with its adjective "libertà".
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele difende Giulia contro i pericoli." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele defends Julia against dangers." Each word is correctly inflected for number, gender, and tense as appropriate for its role in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "L'alchimista fa che l'oro derivi dal piombo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The alchemist makes gold derive from lead.", where "fa" is used as an auxiliary verb for the compound past tense.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo spostò il cappello dall'armadio al tavolo." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar in terms of morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject, "spostò" is the verb that agrees with the singular masculine subject, and "il cappello", "dall'armadio," and "al tavolo" serve as objects or location indicators respectively. Therefore, it does not contain any errors and is understandable in context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo pone il libro sulla scrivania." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[Leonardo puts the book on the desk.]". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in the given sentence.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is a masculine singular noun that requires the use of the definite article "il." "Cappotto" means "coat," which agrees with the verb "prese," meaning "took," in gender and number. Lastly, "dall'armadio" means "from the closet," where "l'" is an abbreviated form of "lo," indicating a masculine singular direct object. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes were found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele spedì la ricevuta all'ufficio delle imposte." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele sent the receipt to the tax office.", where "Gabriele" is the subject, "spedì" is the verb in simple past tense that agrees with the third person singular masculine gender ("he"), "la" is the definite article for feminine singular nouns, "ricevuta" is the direct object which refers to a document or invoice received, and "all'ufficio delle imposte" is an idiomatic expression meaning "to the tax office".
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola spinse le gambe di Francesco verso la parete." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola pushed Francesco's legs towards the wall.", where "Paola" is the subject, "le gambe" is the direct object referring to Francesco's legs, and "di Francesco" indicates possession. All grammatical rules for agreement between words based on gender and number have been respected.
1	Correct	The sentence "I enjoy playing basketball with my friends." is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("I enjoy playing basketball" and "my friends play soccer") connected by a coordinating conjunction ("and"). Both subject-verb agreement and verb tense are consistent within each clause.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il dottore spennella le tonsille di Gabriele di iodio." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The doctor paints iodine on Gabriel's tonsils," which follows the standard rules for word order and agreement in Italian sentences.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo archiviò la documentazione nell'archivio centrale." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, "Leonardo" is the subject who performed an action in the past tense, which is correctly indicated by the use of "archiviò". "Documentazione" is the direct object that received the action of being filed away, as shown by its position after the verb. Finally, "nell'archivio centrale" is the location where the action took place. Overall, the structure and word choice make for a coherent and understandable statement with no apparent errors or inconsistencies.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using reflexive verbs with multiple subjects, you need to use the plural form of the reflexive pronoun. Therefore, "I gomiti" should be changed to "Le gambe" for grammatical correctness. Here's the corrected version: Le gambe si poggiano sul davanzale.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo affoga i dispiaceri nel vino." is grammatically correct. It means "[Riccardo] drowns his sorrows in wine". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Un buon timoniere attracca rapidamente la sua nave al molo." is grammatically correct. It means "A good helmsman quickly docks his ship at the pier" in English. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the given Italian sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea spostò il bicchiere dal tavolo sul mobile" is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, "Andrea" is the subject who moved "il bicchiere" from "il tavolo" to "il mobile". All nouns and verbs agree in number and gender as required by Italian language rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso pompava l'acqua dal lago alla piscina" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso was pumping water from the lake to the pool". Each word is used correctly according to its grammatical function, so no mistakes were found regarding morphology or syntax. Additionally, the meaning conveyed by the sentence makes sense semantically, which confirms that it’s free of errors.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the third person plural verb form "negoziano" (negotiate), the subject pronouns "egli" or "lui" (he) cannot be used as they indicate only one male individual. Instead, for multiple individuals, genderless subject pronouns such as "esso", "loro", or zero-subject pronouns must be employed. Therefore, in this case, since both Masha and Maria are female, it would be more appropriate to use the genderless singular "esso" or leave out the pronoun entirely ("Masha e Maria negoziano la libertà"). However, if you want to specify that two males are negotiating, then "loro" can be used correctly as follows: "Alessandro e Leonardo negoziano la libertà."
1	Correct	The sentence "Una donna aveva separato Masha e Jane." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple past tense verb had separated (aveva separato) with its subject una donna (one woman). The direct object is Masha e Jane (Masha and Jane), who were separated by the woman in the past.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "ricava". The preposition "dalle" means "from", which introduces the phrase "le sue applicazioni", meaning "his applications." So overall, it means "Alessandro earns money from his applications," which makes sense and follows all grammar rules for word order, agreement, tense, etc.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo allontana Maria dalla stanza." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rules with the verb "allontana" agreeing with its singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the preposition "dalla" correctly indicates movement away from something, followed by the noun phrase "stanzA", which matches the gender and number of the previously mentioned feminine singular noun "Maria".
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo conta su Francesco." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo counts on Francesco." Each word is correctly inflected for number and person, and it follows the standard SVO structure (Subject-Verb-Object) with no missing or extra components.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia confunde il piacere con la possibilità di essere corteggiata." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sophia confuses pleasure with the possibility of being courted.", where "confunde" is the third person singular form of the verb "confondere", which agrees with the subject "Sofia".
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso fondue l'argento con l'oro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso melted the silver with gold.", where "fondue" is the third person singular indicative imperfect form of the verb "fondere", which agrees with the subject "Tommaso".
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele ci sostituisce il tubo catodico." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("Gabriele"), an adverbial complement indicating that something is being done for someone else ("ci", which stands for "a noi" or "for us"), and a direct object ("il tubo catodico" or "the cathode ray tube"). This structure follows standard Italian syntax rules, so no mistakes were found in terms of morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo le sostituisce il tubo catodico." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and proper agreement between the verb and its subject ("Riccardo" is singular masculine and "sostituisce" agrees with that). Additionally, the use of the indirect object pronoun "le" correctly refers back to an unspecified feminine direct object earlier mentioned in conversation or implied by context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso alterna Beatrice con Paola." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order and the verb "alternare" agrees with its subject "Tommaso". Additionally, the preposition "con" followed by "Paola" indicates that she is also involved in the action expressed by the verb.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "leghi" in present indicative tense, it requires an object pronoun such as "lo", "la", or "li" before it depending on the gender and number of the direct object. Therefore, the sentence "L'amore lega." is syntactically incorrect since there is no object pronoun used with the verb "legare". To make the sentence grammatically correct, you can say "L'amore **lo** lega.", where "lo" refers to the love itself.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele dorme" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure for an independent clause with a third-person singular subject and its corresponding verb form. In this case, "Gabriele" is the subject and "dorme" is the third-person singular conjugated form of the verb "dormire," meaning "to sleep." Therefore, no errors or corrections can be identified in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "desiderare" (to want) with a direct object, we need to use the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have) rather than "essere" (to be). Additionally, since both Masha and Jane are mentioned as wanting a book, the subject needs to be in its plural form. Therefore, the correct version would be: "Masha e Jane **hanno** il desiderio di un libro."
0	Syntax	In Italian, subjunctive mood is used after certain conjunctions such as "che" which introduces a dependent clause indicating doubt or uncertainty. Here, in English, we use the base form of the verb ("you come") but in Italian it requires the third person singular present tense of the subjunctive mood "tu venga". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Maria desidera il fatto che tu venga."
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo tiene alla possibilità che lo promuovano" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo has the opportunity that they promote him". Each word is correctly inflected for number and gender, and it follows the rules of syntax in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence "Giulia abbandona l'idea che vedrà Edoardo." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian syntax, morphology, and semantics. Here, the subject Giulia leaves the idea that she will see Edoardo in the future.
0	Syntax	In Italian, adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. In this case, "bello" (masculine singular) does not match the feminine singular subject "affermazione". It should be changed to "bella" for grammatical agreement. So, the corrected sentence would be: "Maria ha fatto l'affermazione che Francesca è bella."
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria bada che tutto funzioni alla perfezione." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Mary makes sure that everything works perfectly" in English. In this sentence, "bada" is used correctly as it means "takes care", which fits the context. Additionally, the subjunctive mood is appropriately used after "che". Therefore, no mistakes can be identified in this sentence.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject that approves, and it agrees with the verb form "approva". "Che" introduces the subordinate clause where "Maria" is the subject who leaves, as indicated by the verb form "parta". Both verbs agree with their respective subjects in number and gender. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "dubitare" with two indirect objects in the same sentence, you need to use the preposition "di" before the second object. Therefore, the correct form would be "Emma dubita di che **le** Alice parti." The bolded word "le" is needed as a polite way to indicate that Emma doubts about what Alice does.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "viaggiare" with multiple subjects, we use the third person plural form "viaggiano". Therefore, the correct form would be "Che Lorenzo e Tommaso **viaggiano** angoscia." Instead of "Che Lorenzo viaggi angoscia Tommaso."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "ciò" as a pronoun referring to an idea or concept previously mentioned in the conversation, it needs to agree with its antecedent in gender and number. Here, since "idea" is feminine singular ("l'idea"), we need to use "essa" instead of "ciò". Additionally, the verb must also match the subject in number and tense; therefore, "approva" should change to "approvano", which is the first-person plural form of the present indicative tense. So, the corrected sentence would be: "Riccardo lo approvano essa."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "il" as a definite article, it must agree in gender and number with the noun that follows. However, in this case, "fatto" is masculine singular while "che Maria canti" refers to a fact that Maria sings, which is feminine singular since "canti" agrees with "Maria". Therefore, "il fatto" should be replaced by "la facts", making the corrected sentence: "Edoardo la approva la fatta che Maria canti."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using an infinitive verb as the main verb in a sentence with multiple subjects, you need to use "essere" (to be) as an auxiliary verb before the infinitive verb, not just the infinitive alone. Also, both subjects must agree with the auxiliary verb conjugated properly. Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Tu e Sofia volete venire." (You and Sophia want to come.)
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "and" to connect two nouns that refer to people or things, you need to use a plural form for verbs. Therefore, in this case, the verb "va" should change to "vanno". So, the corrected version would be: "Masha e Jane vanno al fumo."
1	Correct	The sentence "Alice brama di tornare" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alice yearns to return." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "a che" with an infinitive verb, we need to use the subjunctive mood. Therefore, it should be "si sposino" instead of "si sposi". Also, note that "che" can often be omitted in such constructions, so another possible correction would be "Andrea incoraggia Maria a sposarsi."
1	Correct	The sentence "Il fatto che Masha e Jane parlino inglese piace ai loro genitori." is grammatically correct. It follows the rules for subject-verb agreement in Italian with multiple subjects ("Masha" and "Jane"), uses the appropriate form of the verb "parlare" to agree with those subjects, and employs proper word order.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "andare" (to go) with a place, you need to include "a" or "in" before the location. Therefore, the sentence "Andare al cinema infiamma Sofia." should be "Andare **al** cinema infiamma Sofia.", where "al" means "to the".
1	Correct	The sentence "La colpisce che Riccardo rida." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It strikes her that Riccardo is laughing". In this sentence, "la" refers to a feminine singular direct object pronoun, "colpisce" is the third person singular form of the verb "colpire", which means "to strike", "che" introduces a relative clause, and "Riccardo" is the subject of the embedded question. Therefore, I would say it's grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "I am surprised that Beatrice is undressed." is grammatically correct in English. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this statement.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using an infinitive verb as the subject of a sentence, it must always be preceded by "è" or "sono," depending on the number and gender of the actual subject in question. Here, since both Masha and Jane are female, we would use "sono." Additionally, reflexive verbs such as "allietare" need to agree with their subject; therefore, we require the third-person feminine plural form "si allietano". So, a correct version of this sentence could be: "Masha e Jane si allietano perché Maria ride."
1	Correct	The sentence "La tristezza e la noia deprimono Gabriele." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sadness and boredom depress Gabriel.", where "tristezza" is the noun for sadness, "noia" is the noun for boredom, "deprimono" is the third-person plural verb that agrees with its subject "la tristezza e la noia", which translates to "sadness and boredom". Finally, "Gabriele" is the name of the person being affected by these feelings.
1	Correct	The sentence "I am pleased that Julia speaks in this way" is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject "I" agrees with its verb form "am", and the clause "that Julia speaks in this way" correctly follows the subordinating conjunction "that". Additionally, the meaning conveyed by the sentence is clear without any ambiguity.
1	Correct	The sentence "La sola presenza di Alice mi acquieta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The mere presence of Alice calms me down" in English. Here, "la sola presenza" refers to the only or sole presence, while "di Alice" indicates belongingness to Alice. Finally, "mi acquieta" represents the verb that describes what happens when the subject ("la sola presenza") affects the object (implied as "me").
1	Correct	The sentence "I enjoy talking with dancers" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a subject "I", verb "enjoy", an infinitive phrase "talking with dancers" that functions as the direct object, and the preposition "with" introducing the prepositional phrase "with dancers". All elements fit together well syntactically and semantically.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "piacere" (to please) or its reciprocal form "piacersi" (to like each other), the subject comes after the verb and the indirect object pronoun must be used before the verb. Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Io sono affascinato da questo fatto che Edoardo piaccia a me." This translates to "I am fascinated by the fact that Edoardo pleases me." However, in English, we don't use an equivalent structure for liking something or someone; hence it might sound strange in English too.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "accade" (happen) with multiple subjects, it requires the plural form "accadono". Therefore, the sentence should read as "Di vedere i marziani **accadono** a Paola." instead of "accade", which only agrees with one subject.
0	Syntax	In Italian, after the verb "avere" (to have) in compound tenses, the past participle must agree with the subject's number and gender. Here, the past participle "vinto" does not match the feminine singular subject "la fortuna." It should be "vinta". Additionally, "splendeva" requires a singular subject, but it follows a coordination of two nouns ("Masha e Jane") that require a plural form. Therefore, the appropriate conjugation for third person plural would be "splendevano." The corrected sentence is: "Masha ed io avevamo vinta la fortuna e splendevamo nella sua gioia."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "di" with a past participle ("aver vinto"), the auxiliary verb used must agree in number with the subject. Here, the subject "they" is plural, but the auxiliary verb "ha" is singular. It should be changed to "hanno", which is the third person plural form of "have". Therefore, the corrected sentence would read: "Di averlo vinto al lotto **splendevano** nel loro sguardo."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "trattare" with an impersonal subject ("si" in this case) followed by an infinitive verb, it requires that the infinitive verb follows immediately after without any other words in between. However, in the given sentence, "dobbiamo" comes between them, which makes the sentence ungrammatical. A correct version would be: "Si tratta di dover fuggire."
1	Correct	The sentence "Si tratta di fuggire." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "tratta" agrees with its singular subject "si". Also, the word "fuggire" acts as an infinitive verbal complement that completes the meaning of the main verb "tratta", which means "to deal with".
1	Correct	The sentence "Il fatto che Emma sia uscita così presto denota che in questo momento non va d'accordo con te." is grammatically correct. It follows proper Italian syntax rules for forming complex sentences with two clauses joined by "che" and uses appropriate verb forms based on subject-verb agreement. In addition, all words are spelled correctly and used appropriately given their context within the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Io condanno il fatto che Erode uccise i bambini." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I condemn the fact that Herod killed the children". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in it.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele adora carezzare Andrea" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele loves to cuddle Andrea". Both proper nouns agree with their respective verbs in number and gender.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea intende sposare Alice" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Andrew plans to marry Alice". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make it ungrammatical.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo evita guardare la televisione" is grammatically correct in Italian. Although it might seem strange to native English speakers, in Italian we can omit the subject when it is clear from context or when using certain verbs such as "evitare". In this case, "Riccardo" is understood to be the subject who avoids watching TV, so the sentence does not require an explicit subject pronoun.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "si" as an impersonal pronoun, it must agree in number with the subject that follows. Therefore, since "partire" is a verb that requires a plural subject ("noi"), "si" needs to change to match its plural form, which is "ci". So, the correct sentence would be "Paola ritiene che ci si parte sia carino."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "ritenere" with two indirect objects in the singular form, it is required to use "che" before the second object. Therefore, the correct version of the sentence would be "Lorenzo la riteneva Alice fosse Paola", where "la" refers to the pronoun for the subject being referred to by the first indirect object ("Alice"). However, without context or further information about what the intended meaning of the original sentence was, I cannot suggest an appropriate correction.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "che" as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause that includes its own subject, you do not need to use an accusative form of the pronoun for the subject in the main clause. However, it seems that many native speakers find such sentences ungrammatical or awkward even though they are technically correct according to formal grammar rules. Therefore, I will consider it incorrect due to common usage. A more natural way to say the same thing would be "Beatrice la giudica severamente perché Maria ha troppi amanti."
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia la giudica che Maria ha troppi amanti." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Sofia" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "giudica". * "la" is an object pronoun that refers back to a female singular noun mentioned earlier in the conversation or text. In this case, since we don't have any other information about the context, we can assume that "la" refers to some feminine singular noun mentioned before. * "giudica" means "judges", which matches the number and gender of its subject "Sofia". * "che" introduces a relative clause that modifies the direct object "la". * "Maria" is the subject of the subordinate clause introduced by "che", and it also agrees with its verb "ha". * "ha" means "has", which matches the number and gender of its subject "Maria". * "troppi" is an adjective meaning "too many", which modifies the noun "amanti". It agrees with "amanti" in terms of gender (masculine) and number (plural). * "amanti" means "lovers", which is what "troppi" describes. It also agrees with "troppi" in terms of gender (masculine) and number (plural).
1	Correct	The sentence "Giulia lo giudica evidente che Maria sia bella." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "Giulia" is the subject who judges something as "evidente", which means obvious or clear. This adjective agrees with the masculine singular pronoun "lo". Furthermore, "che Maria sia bella" is a subordinate clause that indicates what Giulia considers as evident. It contains the verb "essere" (to be) in the third person singular form ("sia") followed by an adjective "bella," agreeing with its feminine gender and singular number. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct without any mistakes regarding morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo thinks that his father drinks too much" is grammatically correct in English. It follows proper subject-verb agreement rules as well as word order and tense consistency.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "qualcosa" (something) with an indirect object pronoun such as "di te" (about you), we need to use the verb in its auxiliary form "sto." Therefore, the sentence should be "Io sto pensando qualcosa di te," which translates to "I am thinking something about you" in English.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "penso che" construction, the verb that follows must be in the indicative mood, not the subjunctive as it is here ("ami" instead of "ama"). Therefore, the second part of the sentence should read "che lei ama il tartufo", meaning "that she loves truffles".
1	Correct	The sentence "Emma ottiene qualcosa da te." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Emma gets something from you.", where "Emma" is the subject, "ottiene" is the verb meaning "gets", "qualcosa" is an indefinite pronoun meaning "something", and "da te" means "from you". All elements in the sentence agree with each other both in gender and number, making it a grammatical sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "a" after certain verbs (like "lavorare"), it requires that the subsequent verb must be in the gerund form (-ando or -endo). However, in this case, "cacciare" is not in its gerund form. It should be "Alice lavora a caccia di Maria."
1	Correct	The given sentence "Riccardo plaude al fatto che Tommaso ha vinto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It follows proper subject-verb agreement as well as word order rules for subordinating conjunctions.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "ci" as an indirect object pronoun indicating movement towards something or motion in general, it needs to be paired with the auxiliary verb "essere" rather than "avere". Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be: "Maria **è** qui aspirata." Instead of "Maria **ha** ciaspirata.", which uses the wrong auxiliary verb "avere".
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "ci" as an indirect object pronoun meaning "to us," it needs to be paired with a reflexive verb in third person plural form ("si aggrappano" rather than "si aggrappa"). Therefore, the corrected version would be "Maria ci s'aggrappano."
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola mira a che il futuro sia felice." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola hopes that the future will be happy". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Giulia guardava il muro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia was watching the wall" in English. There are no mistakes related to morphology, syntax or semantics in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo thinks Tommaso." is grammatically correct in English as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and the verb "thinks" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo".
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "avere" as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses with a direct object pronoun such as "la," it must come before the past participle in the correct order: subject + auxiliary verb ("ha") + direct object pronoun ("la") + past participle. Therefore, the correct form would be "Paola l'ha accettato." Instead, the given sentence uses "acconsentire a che," which means "to agree that," but lacks the infinitive after "che." Thus, making the corrected version of the sentence: "Paola ha acconsentito che la leggessero."
1	Correct	The sentence "Alice sorride del fatto di aver pianto" is grammatically correct in Italian. Although it may seem unusual for an English speaker, since "pianto" is the past participle form that agrees with the gender and number of its subject, which is feminine singular in this case ("il fatto"). So, the literal translation would be something like "Alice smiles about the fact of having cried".
1	Correct	The sentence "La condizione di disagio nasce dalla mancanza d'acqua" is grammatically correct. It follows proper Italian syntax rules with no morphological or semantic errors detected in the provided context.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "risultare" with a subject composed of multiple nouns connected by "e", you need to use a plural form of the verb that matches the subject. Therefore, "partire" should be changed to its plural form "partiamo". Here is how it should look: "Da questa analisi risultiamo partire."
1	Correct	The sentence "La tosse dipende dal fatto di aver fumato troppo." is grammatically correct in Italian. This is because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular feminine noun "tosse" matches with the singular third person verb form "dipende". Additionally, all other elements such as articles and pronouns also agree in gender and number throughout the sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "che" as a conjunction to connect two clauses, both clauses need to have their own subject explicitly stated or implied. Here, in the second clause ("non è colpa sua"), the subject ("egli", he) is not mentioned but understood from context. However, since we already have an explicit subject in the first clause ("Leonardo"), it would sound more natural to include the subject also in the second clause for clarity. So you could say either "Leonardo chiarisce che egli non è colpa sua" or simply "Leonardo chiarisce di non essere colpevole".
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "che" to introduce a subordinate clause that refers back to a singular noun or pronoun, we need to use the singular form of the verb in the subordinate clause. However, in this case, the subordinate clause uses the plural form "hanno," which does not agree with its singular subject "lei." Therefore, the corrected sentence should be "Andrea fischia a Maria che ha fame."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "se" to indicate "if," the verb that follows it must be in its indicative form rather than the subjunctive form. Therefore, the sentence "Andrea accennerà ad Edoardo se partirà o no" is syntactically incorrect since "partirà" should be replaced with "parte." A corrected version would be "Andrea accennerà ad Edoardo se parte o no."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "avere" as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses such as passato prossimo, it must agree in number with the subject. Here, the singular form "ha" was used, but the subject "Paola e Leonardo" requires the use of the plural form "hanno". So, the correct form would be "Paola e Leonardo hanno addebitato a Leonardo il fatto che ora hanno fame."
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been learning about machine learning" is grammatically correct. It consists of three clauses: I have been learning, about machine learning, and there is an implied you understand. All of these elements follow standard English grammar rules for verb tense agreement, word order, subject-verb agreement, and punctuation.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria ce lo ha scommesso" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here, "ce" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to someone or something not explicitly mentioned in the sentence, but understood from context; "lo" is a direct object pronoun referring to a masculine singular noun; and "scommesso" is the past participle form of the verb "scommettere," which means "to bet." Therefore, the entire phrase can be translated as "Mary bet on it."
1	Correct	The sentence "The journalists attack on the newspapers the fact that many politicians are corrupt" is grammatically correct in English. However, it might sound more natural with some changes, such as: "The journalists attack the newspapers for reporting that many politicians are corrupt." But both sentences follow the rules of English grammar.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola incoraggia il fatto che i ragazzi vadano al mare." is grammatically correct. It means "Paola encourages the fact that the boys go to the sea". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Emma ne avvisa Alessandro" follows all grammatical rules in Italian language. Here, "ne" is an adverb that means "about it or about them." It refers to something mentioned before, which can be understood from context. So, the given sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele lo convince che lo sciopero è giusto." is grammatically correct. It consists of three simple sentences combined with two instances of "lo" used as direct object pronouns referring to the masculine singular noun that follows in each case ("sciopero"). There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo esime Riccardo dal viaggio." is grammatically correct in Italian. Although it might seem unusual or unnatural due to its repetition, it follows all grammatical rules for word order, verb agreement, and syntax.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il sindaco presenta le dimissioni" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The mayor resigns". All words are correctly inflected for number, gender, and tense. There is no agreement or word order issue. Therefore it falls into the category of being correct.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct. All words agree with each other in terms of tense, number, gender, etc., and they follow Italian syntax rules for word order and structure. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence can be understood clearly without any ambiguity or confusion.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "discorrere" which means "to talk about," it requires the preposition "di" after it followed by the topic being discussed. However, in this case, the direct object "partire" (to leave) was used right after "discorrere." To fix this error, you can say "Alice discorre **di** partire con Giulia," meaning "Alice talks about leaving with Julia."
0	Syntax	In Italian, reflexive verbs require that the subject matches with the object in number and gender. Here, "si" refers to both "Masha" and "Jane", so it needs to be paired with a plural form of "essere". Therefore, "essere" should be replaced by its plural form "sono": "Maria e Giulia si accorgono di **sono** innamorate dal fatto di arrossire."
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo continua a mangiarlo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo continues to eat it." In this sentence, "continua" is the third person singular present tense conjugation of the verb "continuare", which agrees with the subject "Edoardo". The pronoun "lo" refers to something previously mentioned that Edoardo is continuing to eat. Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo loves to indulge in eating." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple clause with a subject ("Leonardo") and a verb phrase ("loves to indulge in eating"). Both nouns and verbs agree in number, making it a proper English sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the present tense of a verb with third person singular or plural subjects, you need to add -(e)s at the end of the verb for he/she/it or they in the case of singular or plural subjects respectively. However, in this sentence, the subject "Edoardo" is a single individual so no -(e)s is needed. But, as it stands, the verb form used ("osa") does not match the subject since it would translate to "(he/she/it) dares". So, the correct form here should have been "osa mangiare", but changing the subject to a plural one could also work such as "Edoardo e Giacomo osano mangiare" which means "(Edoardo and Giacomo) dare to eat".
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola è capace di cavalcare." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[Paola] is capable of riding [horses or bikes]". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes that would make it unacceptable as a standalone statement.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "avere" as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses with multiple subjects, it must agree in number with the subject. Therefore, "hanno" should be used instead of "ha". Here's how the corrected sentence would look like: Maria e Giovanni hanno l'intenzione di cavalcare. (Maria and Giovanni have the intention of riding.)
0	Syntax	In Italian, seriate verb conjugations must agree with their subject in number. Here, "Tommaso" is singular while "suole" is third person plural. It should be "suona" for agreement with its singular subject. Therefore, the grammatically correct form would be "Tommaso suona il pasto."
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo deve mangiare" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure for expressing an action that will take place in the future with the verb "mangiare" (to eat). In this case, "deve" functions as an auxiliary verb used to form the compound tense required for indicating futurity in Italian. Furthermore, the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the third person singular present indicative form "mangia". Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be identified in this statement.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using an indirect object pronoun such as "gli" or "le", it must come before the verb it refers to, not after. Also, in this case, since "Gabriele" is the subject, we don't need any additional pronouns. Therefore, the corrected sentence would simply be: "Gabriele lo usa." which means "[He] uses it".
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo va in camera." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-location structure where "Riccardo" is the subject, "va" is the verb meaning "goes," and "in camera" means "to his room". The verb conjugation matches with the singular masculine subject "Riccardo", making the sentence grammatically accurate.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "in" to indicate movement into an enclosed space such as "camera" (room), you need to use the singular form of the verb that matches the subject. So it should be "entra" not "entrano". Also, the definite article "la" needs to be added before "camera". Hence, the corrected sentence would be "Andrea entra nella camera." or "Masha e Jane entrano nella camera.", depending on whether we want to convey they enter one by one or all at once.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo sparisce da Parigi." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows all the rules of morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject who is disappearing from "Parigi" which means Paris.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo parte a Parigi." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo leaves for Paris.", where "Edoardo" is the subject in third person singular form, "parte" is the verb in third person singular present tense, and "a Parigi" is the destination expressed as an adverbial phrase with the preposition "a".
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola sgambetta verso il ponte." is grammatically correct. It means "Paola walks towards the bridge" in English. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "La folla lo corre a salutare" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The crowd runs to greet him." In this sentence, "la frolla" refers to the feminine singular noun for "crowd," "lo" is the masculine singular direct object pronoun that replaces "lui" (which means "him"), "corre" is the third person present tense conjugation of the verb "correre" (to run), and "a salutare" is an infinitive phrase acting as the destination or goal of the action. Overall, all grammatical components in this sentence adhere to standard rules and syntax, making it acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso invia Emma in piazza." is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Tommaso") followed by a verb ("invia") that agrees with it in number and tense, and then an indirect object ("Emma") and a prepositional phrase ("in piazza"). All elements have a clear grammatical function and follow Italian word order rules, making the sentence understandable without any mistakes.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Beatrice" is the subject of the sentence and "assembla" is the verb that agrees with the third person singular. Therefore, the translation for this sentence would be "Beatrice assembles a computer."
1	Correct	The sentence "Il film è di Scorsese." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows all the rules for word order, verb agreement, and article usage. Here, "il" is an appropriate definite article for singular masculine nouns such as "film", while "è" is the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "to be". Moreover, "di" means "of or by" which is used appropriately here indicating possession. Hence, no grammatical errors were found in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola lavora." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense form of the verb "lavorare" agrees with its singular feminine subject "Paola".
0	Syntax	In Italian, adjectives usually agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. Here, "quell(o)" modifies "quadro" which is masculine singular, so it should be "quel". However, since "angosciante" is also an option that agrees in gender and number with "quadro", both sentences "È l'amica che di Emma angoscia quel quadro di Picasso." and "È l'amica che di Emma angoscia quello quadro di Picasso." could be considered acceptable, although the latter is more common.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have eaten enough for today" is grammatically correct in English. Here, "have" is used as an auxiliary verb to form the present perfect tense, while "eaten" is the past participle form of the verb "to eat". The phrase "for today" indicates that the action occurred today and only up until now. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
0	Morphology	In Italian, adjectives need to agree in number and gender with the noun they modify. In this case, "qualche" means some or several and it needs to match the plural form of museums which is "musei". Therefore, the correct form should be "Quelli alcuni musei sono stati progettati da un architetto." where "quelli" refers back to the previously mentioned museums, making the meaning clearer.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola mangia la pizza." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure with all necessary components present. Here, "Paola" acts as the subject, "mangia" serves as the verb meaning "eats," and "la pizza" refers to the object being eaten by Paola. Therefore, no grammatical errors exist in the given sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, the past participle must agree in gender and number with the direct object when it comes before the auxiliary verb. Here, "alcuni progetti" (some projects) is the direct object and it is plural, so the past participle "progettato" needs to be changed to its feminine plural form "progettate". Also, "ha" doesn't match with the subject "quell'architetto", as the former indicates third person singular while the latter is masculine singular. It should be replaced by "hanno", which corresponds to third person plural. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Quell'architetto hanno alcune progettate."
1	Correct	The sentence "Hanno letto, molte ragazze, il giornale l'anno scorso." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Many girls read the newspaper last year." Here's why it's correct: - "Hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere," which agrees with the subject "molte ragazze." - "letto" is the past participle of the verb "leggere," and since "hanno" is used as an auxiliary verb here, we know that the action took place in the past. - "molte ragazze" is the plural subject of the sentence, meaning "many girls." - "il giornale" refers to "the newspaper." - "l'anno scorso" means "last year."
1	Correct	The sentence "Le spalle di Riccardo toccano la parete" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo's shoulders touch the wall". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "essere" with multiple subjects connected by "e", we need to use the plural form of the verb. Therefore, it should be "Maria e Jane **saranno** toccate da quel film." Instead of **"Maria sarà toccata da quel film."**.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the present tense of "essere" (to be) with multiple subjects, you need to use a plural form of the verb that agrees in number with the subject. Here, the sentence uses "tu sei" which means "you are," but it should use "siete" which means "you (plural) are." Therefore, the corrected version would be "Che siete partite rallegra Beatrice."
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele è il marito di Paola." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele is Paola's husband" in English. The subject Gabriele is singular, so the third person present tense verb form "è" is used correctly here. All words agree in gender and number as required by grammatical rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice è con Lorenzo." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard subject-verb-complement structure with proper agreement between the singular subject ("Beatrice") and verb form ("è").
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola ha messo la macchina che è del frattelo nel garage." is grammatically correct. It means "Paola put the car that belongs to her brother in the garage". There might be some confusion regarding the gender agreement between "macchina" (feminine) and "fratello" (masculine). However, since they belong to different grammatical categories ("la macchina" as an object and "del fratello" providing additional information about the car), it does not result in any error or contradiction within the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso obbedisce a Maria" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso obeys Mary". In this sentence, "obbedisce" is the third person singular verb form that agrees with the subject "Tommaso", while "a" is the preposition used before the indirect object "Maria".
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "con" to mean "with", both nouns that come after it must have the same form (both singular or both plural). Here, one noun is singular ("Leonardo") while the other is plural ("Andrea"). To fix this issue, either change "Andrea" to its singular form ("Andrea" becomes "Andreа"), or make them both plural by adding an -s at the end of "Leonardo". Therefore, the corrected sentences would be: "Andrea confronta Leonardo con Andreа." or "Andrea e Leоnardо si confrontano con gli Andrea.", where "gli Andrea" refers to more than one person named Andrea in English.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria photographs Paola." In Italian, it's common for the third person singular verb form (-a) to follow the subject even when referring to multiple people or objects. So, no grammatical error was found.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo è stato smanioso." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo was eager." Each word is used correctly according to its grammatical function within the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tua sorella guarda il gelato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Your sister is looking at the ice cream". Here's why it's correct: - "Tua" is a possessive adjective that agrees with the gender (feminine) and number (singular) of the noun it modifies ("sorella"). - "Sorella" means "sister", which is feminine singular. - "Guarda" is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "guardare", meaning "to watch or look at". - "Il" is the masculine singular definite article used before words starting with a consonant sound. In this case, it refers to "gelato", but since "il" comes before a vowel sound here, its written form changes to "l'" according to Italian spelling rules. - "Gelato" means "ice cream".
1	Correct	The sentence "Tua sorella guarda il CD." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Your sister watches the CD". The subject "tua sorella" (your sister) agrees with the verb form "guarda" (watches). There is nothing wrong syntactically or semantically with this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been working on improving my language skills." is grammatically correct. It consists of three clauses - "I have been", "working" and "improving my language skills". All verbs are conjugated correctly according to tense and subject agreement rules. There is also an appropriate use of prepositions, articles and punctuation marks in the sentence. Therefore, it can be considered as syntactically, morphologically and semantically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "I really don't know much about art" is grammatically correct in English. Here, "much" functions as an adverb that modifies the verb phrase "don't know," indicating the degree or extent of not knowing. Additionally, the subject-auxiliary inversion ("do" + subject) highlights the interrogative tone of the sentence. Therefore, no grammatical errors can be identified here.
1	Correct	The sentence "I ragazzi taglierebbero la corda" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The boys would cut the rope." Here, "ragazzi" is the subject which is plural, so it agrees with the verb form "taglierebbero," which is also plural. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be identified in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "È il toro che Maria ha preso per le corna e non il bufalo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It is the bull that Maria took by the horns and not the buffalo.", where "il toro" refers to one specific male bull and "non il bufalo" implies the negative contrast with any other possible animal but specifically another masculine noun. In addition, both "toro" and "bufalo" agree with their respective articles in gender and number. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes were found in the given sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using an indirect object pronoun such as "gli" or "le," it must come before the verb. Therefore, the sentence "Maria gli stende il bucato" would be grammatically correct, with "gli" indicating that the laundry is being done for someone specific. Without "gli," the sentence lacks clarity in its intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il mio cane abbaia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "My dog barks." The word order follows standard Italian syntax rules with the subject ("il mio cane") followed by the verb ("abbaia"). Additionally, all words agree in number and gender as appropriate for Italian morphological rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ulula" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows subject-verb agreement rules. Here, the subject "Riccardo" is singular, so the verb "ulula" which means "howls" or "bays" also appears in its third person singular form. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes were found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele dormì." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure for past tense sentences with a single subject. In this case, "Gabriele" is the subject and "dormì" is the conjugated verb meaning "slept".
1	Correct	The sentence "The dog stopped suddenly" is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("the dog") and a verb ("stopped"), which agrees with the subject in number and tense. Additionally, it includes an adverbial phrase ("suddenly") that modifies the verb. All elements of the sentence have been used correctly, so no mistakes were found regarding morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo ci ha messo due ore per tagliare il filo elettrico." is grammatically correct. It consists of two clauses: "Edoardo ci ha messo due ore" and "per tagliare il filo elettrico". In the first clause, the subject "Edoardo" is followed by the auxiliary verb "ha messo", which agrees with it in number and gender. The direct object pronoun "ci" refers back to an unspoken location or situation where the action took place. The time expression "due ore" indicates that the action lasted for two hours. The preposition "per" introduces the second clause, which explains the purpose of the action described in the first clause. The infinitive verb phrase "tagliare il filo elettrico" means "to cut the electric wire". Overall, the sentence is well-formed both syntactically and semantically.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been to many places." is grammatically correct in English. Here, the subject "I" is followed by the auxiliary verb "have" which indicates present perfect tense. After that, we have the past participle form of the main verb "to be", i.e., "been". Finally, "to many places" acts as an adverbial phrase modifying the verb "have been". Therefore, the structure of the sentence is right.
1	Correct	The sentence "Le sei bombe sono esplose il 6 maggio 1999." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The six bombs exploded on May 6, 1999.", where "le" refers to "bombs", which is feminine plural, "sei" is an adjective that agrees with the noun it modifies, "esplose" is the past tense third person plural form of the verb "esplodere" ("to explode"), and "il" is used for singular masculine direct object pronouns. All the elements within the sentence follow the rules of agreement and conjugations; therefore, it can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo non ha più l'abitudine di fumare." is grammatically correct. It follows proper Italian syntax rules for subject-verb agreement, tense usage, and word order. Additionally, all words used in the sentence have their appropriate morphological forms based on gender, number, etc. Therefore, it can be concluded that this sentence is grammatical and acceptable in standard Italian.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "diventare" (to become) with an adverb such as "in gamba", the verb must agree in number with the subject. Therefore, since both "Masha" and "Jane" are feminine singular nouns, the correct form of the verb would be "è diventata". So, the corrected sentence should read: "Masha e Jane sono diventate in gamba."
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso ha fatto gli auguri a Giulia." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "Tommaso" is the subject, performing the action expressed by the verb "ha fatto", which agrees with the singular masculine subject "Tommaso". The direct object of the sentence is "gli auguri," which is correctly marked for indirect object agreement with the preposition "a" before "Giulia". Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia chiede che tu torni immediatamente." is grammatically correct. It follows the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure in Italian where "Sofia" is the subject, "chiede" is the verb, and the rest forms an embedded question with "tu" as its subject, "torni" being the verb, and "immediatamente" being the adverb modifying the verb.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "dispiacere" (to disappoint) with an indirect object (in this case, "Beatrice"), you need to use the verb in its impersonal form ("dispiacergli") and change the order of the words so that the indirect object comes before the verb. Therefore, the correct sentence would be "A Beatrice dispiace che te ne vai".
1	Correct	The sentence "I bambini hanno calpestato le aiuole." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, "bambini" is plural noun which agrees with the plural third person verb form "hanno". Also, it refers to young boys or girls playing in the park who have trampled on the flower beds represented by "aiuole", hence making perfect sense in context as well.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "eruttare" which means "to belch or burp," it requires an object immediately following the verb. Therefore, the sentence needs to have an object after "eruttarono." For instance, "I bambini eruttarono della cenere." meaning "The children burped out some ash." Hence, without the object, the sentence structure is incomplete leading to syntax error.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quell'uomo ha fotografato l'unico testimone e ciò è avvenuto un mese fa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "That man photographed the only witness and that happened a month ago".
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "ne" as a pronoun referring to "of them", it requires the use of a verb in its plural form. However, in this case, the verb "ha" is used which is singular. It should be replaced with the plural form "hanno". So, the corrected sentence would be: "Quell'uomo **hanno** fotografati."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "ha" followed by another verb in infinitive form ("carezzato"), it requires the use of an auxiliary verb for each subject. Therefore, the correct version would be "Masha e Jane hanno carezzato il volto di Beatrice." Here's how you can break down the corrected sentence: - Masha and Jane (singular verbs: "ha") have (auxiliary verb) - cared (verb in past participle form) - the face (direct object) - of Beatrice (indirect object).
1	Correct	The sentence "Il volto di Paola viene carezzato." is grammatically correct. It means "[Paola's face is being caressed.]" There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo ha fratturato il braccio di Maria." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar in terms of morphology, syntax, and semantics. The subject Edoardo is singular and masculine, which matches with the third person singular verb form "ha" of the auxiliary verb "avere". Furthermore, the object "il braccio" agrees in gender and number with its determiner "il", which refers to Maria.
1	Correct	The sentence "The cat sleeps on the mat" follows standard English grammar rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and verb tense. Therefore it is grammatically correct.
0	Morphology	In Italian, nouns and adjectives must agree in number and gender. In this case, "mesi" which means months is masculine singular while "pochi" which means few is feminine plural. They need to both be either masculine or feminine as well as singular or plural. A possible correction could be "Il bambino pesava pochi chili a pochi mesi." where both words are masculine singular.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gli operai asfaltarono la strada." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The workers paved the road" in English. Here's why it's correct: * "Operai" is the plural form of "operaio", which refers to male workers or workmen. In this case, since it's plural, we need to use "gli" before it to agree with the masculine gender and plural number. * "Asfaltarono" is the past tense third-person plural conjugation of the verb "asfaltare", meaning "to pave". This agrees with the subject "operai" both in terms of person (third) and number (plural). * Finally, "la strada" is the singular feminine noun for "road", which requires the definite article "la" before it.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola elencò l'invitato." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Paola" is the subject and it is correctly conjugated with the simple past tense ("elencò") which agrees with the feminine singular subject. * "l'invitato" is a direct object and it follows the standard structure for masculine singular nouns with an article ("l'"). Overall, the sentence is syntactically correct as all elements follow the rules of agreement and word order in Italian.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "ci" as an indirect object pronoun, it needs to be paired with its corresponding direct object pronoun ("lo", "la", or "li"). Here, the error lies in not including the direct object pronoun before "ciò". A corrected version would be: "Alice ha messo **gli** ciò è accaduto **li** vestiti nell'armadio." However, even with this correction, the second part of the sentence still seems unnatural and confusing; I recommend revising that part for clarity.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria ha tolto i vestiti e ciò è accaduto nell'armadio." is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses ("Maria ha tolto i vestiti" and "ciò è accaduto nell'armadio") connected by the conjunction "e". In both clauses, verbs agree with their respective subjects in number and gender. Therefore, no corrections need to be made.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice riempie il frigo con frutta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice fills the fridge with fruit.", where "Beatrice" is the subject, "riempie" is the verb meaning "fills", "il frigo" is the direct object referring to "the fridge", and "con frutta" is a prepositional phrase that tells us what she is filling it with ("with fruit"). All grammatical components are present and correctly used in their respective forms according to number and gender agreement rules.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" and "difende" agree in number and gender, as well as "Andrea" and "dai". Additionally, the verb form "difende" indicates that the subject of the sentence performs an action on someone else or something else ("Andrea", in this case). Therefore, no mistakes were found in terms of morphological agreement, syntax, and semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il libro passa da Maria a Jane." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The book passes from Mary to Jane.", where "libro" is a masculine singular noun meaning "book", "passa" is a third-person singular verb in the present tense that agrees with the subject "il libro", which means "it passes". "Da" is a preposition indicating movement or direction, followed by proper nouns "Maria" and "Jane" as the starting point and ending point of the action, respectively.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria dà un libro a Paola" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria gives a book to Paola". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco delega Gabriele suo rappresentante" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco appoints Gabriele as his representative". Here, "Francesco" is the subject who is doing the action of appointing; "Gabriele" is the direct object receiving the action, while "suo rappresentante" is an adjectival phrase that describes the role of Gabriele. Therefore, no grammatical error can be found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "delegare" which means "to delegate," it requires the preposition "a" before the person who is being delegated to. Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be: "Sofia la delega a Maria come sua rappresentante."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "ciò" (it) as a subject in a sentence, it must agree with the verb conjugation based on the actual gender and number of "ciò." However, in this case, the singular form "succede" was used instead of the plural form "succedono". Therefore, since "ciò" here refers to multiple events happening in Rome, the correct verb form should be "succedono," which agrees in number with its plural antecedent. Hence, a more accurate version would be: "Lorenzo abita e ciò succedono a Roma."
1	Correct	The sentence "I have eaten sushi and it happened at the restaurant" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "and". Each clause contains a subject ("I", "it") and a verb ("have eaten", "happened"). The tense is consistent within each clause.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "and" to connect two nouns that both perform an action, you need to use a plural form of the verb. However, in this case, only one verb form ("fuma") is used after "Sofia e Maria". It should be "fumano" for the sentence to be grammatically correct. Corrected version: "Sofia e Maria fumano una sigaretta."
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo ha spalmato il paté sul pane." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo spread the pâté on the bread" in English. The subject Edoardo is singular and agrees with the third person singular verb form "ha spalmato". Also, the definite article "il" correctly precedes the noun "paté", which is masculine singular.

1	Correct	The sentence "Le bombe piovevano su di noi." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The bombs were raining down on us." Each word is correctly conjugated for its role in the sentence, and it follows standard subject-verb-object structure.
0	Syntax	In Italian, adjectives generally need to agree with the noun they modify in terms of gender and number. Here, "misti" does not match the gender or number of its associated noun "matrimoni." It should either be "i matrimoni misti" or "il matrimonio misto," depending on context.
1	Correct	The sentence "La tua idea equivale alla mía." is grammatically correct in Italian. Both "tua" and "mía" agree with their respective adjectives "idea" and "equivala," which match the gender and number of the nouns they refer to. In particular, both "tua" and "mía" are feminine singular pronouns that mean "your". Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "La tua idea e la mia si equivalgono" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Your idea and mine are equivalent." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.

1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo controlla Paola" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo checks Paola". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "che" as a conjunction introducing subordinate clauses after certain verbs such as "acconsentire", the verb in the dependent clause must agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, since both "Masha" and "Jane" are female and plural, the correct form of the verb "esce" should be its third-person plural form, which is "escano". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Maria acconsente a che le figlie escano con quel ragazzo."
0	Syntax	In English, verbs must agree in number with their subject. Here, the verb "bada" does not match the subject "Alice," which is singular. A correct form would be "Alice bathes."
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola dubita di te." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola doubts you.", where "dubita" is the third person singular form of the verb "dubitare", which agrees with the subject "Paola". "Di" introduces the indirect object "te", and it is used when expressing doubt about someone or something. Therefore, no corrections need to be made to this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "che" in subordinate clauses after verbs that express wishes or desires such as "desiderare", the verb following "che" must agree with its subject in number and person. Therefore, since both "Masha" and "Jane" are feminine singular nouns, the correct form would be "Maria desidera che tu **parta**." not "Maria desidera che tu **parte**".
1	Correct	The sentence "Che Giulia sia sempre in viaggio piace ad Andrea." is grammatically correct. It means "That Giulia is always traveling pleases Andrea.", where "che" is a conjunction used to introduce subordinate clauses, "Giulia" is the subject, "sia" is an auxiliary verb used for expressing hypotheses or suppositions, "sempre" means "always", "in viaggio" means "traveling", "piace" is the third person singular form of the verb "piacere" which means "to please". So overall it is a grammatically correct sentence with no mistakes related to morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" (subject) is willingly enchanting ("volontariamente affascinando") "Francesco" (direct object). Both nouns and verbs agree in number and gender according to their grammatical role in the sentence, which is also the case here.
0	Syntax	In Italian subjunctive mood constructions, when the subject in the main clause is different from the one in the dependent clause, the pronoun used as the subject in the dependent clause must agree with the verb conjugated in the subjunctive form. Here, "lui" (third person singular masculine) does not match with "venga" (third person singular neuter). Therefore, you need to use "esso" or leave it out since "desiderare" takes an impersonal indirect object clitic. So, either "Francesco desidera che egli venga." or "Francesco desidera che venga.", both being grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo annota sul taccuino che il presidente scriverà la sua autobiografia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo takes notes in his notebook that the president will write his autobiography". Every word follows the grammar rules for its role in the sentence, such as gender, number agreement, etc. Also, it forms a coherent meaning without any semantic contradictions or ambiguity.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "invitare" (to invite) with two objects, one needs to use "a" before the second object only when that object refers to an action or event, not a person. Therefore, the correct form would be "Alessandro invita Paola a partirE". Note that I highlighted "parte" in italic as it must agree in number with the subject, so we need to add -E at the end since both Alessandro and Paola are singular.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alice ha accompagnato Tommaso al cinema" means "Alice accompanied Thomas to the cinema." In this sentence, we have one subject ("Alice") who performed an action ("accompanied") on another person ("Tommaso"), specifying where they went together ("al cinema"). It follows the standard SVO structure, making it grammatically sound with no morphological or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "La partenza apporta un beneficio a tutti" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The departure brings a benefit to everyone". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro si lamenta del mare sporco con Paola." is grammatically correct. It means "Alessandro complains about the dirty sea with Paola". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in this sentence.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "Alice" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "mette." - "in agitazione" means "into agitation," which correctly describes what Alice does to Tommaso. - "Tommaso" is the direct object and it follows the expected post-verbal position for transitive verbs. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct as it respects Italian word order and agreement rules between subject and verb.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea lascia a Leonardo pieni poteri." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Andrea leaves full powers to Leonardo" in English. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il piatto piange." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The plate cries" in English. In this case, "piatto" is the subject and it agrees with the singular verb form "piange". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "I like playing basketball" is grammatically correct. Here, "I" is the subject in first-person singular present tense, "like" is the verb that indicates the speaker's preference or inclination towards something, and "playing basketball" is the gerund phrase acting as an object complement for the verb "like". Overall, the structure of the sentence follows standard English grammar rules and makes logical sense.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Alice si è attaccata a un capello" is grammatically correct but semantically odd or incorrect. In English, it would translate to "Alice attached herself to a hair," which doesn't make much sense in most contexts. It might be that she attached something else to a single strand of her own hair, or perhaps she grabbed onto someone else's hair; more information would be needed for a proper translation. As written, though, the sentence does not convey clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria ha piantato Riccardo in asso" is grammatically correct. It means that Maria abandoned or left Riccardo in the lurch. Here, "ha piantato" indicates that the action was performed by someone (in this case, Maria) in the past with an accomplishment aspect. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes were found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia and Jane speak the same language." is grammatically correct in English. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the given statement.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "avere" (to have) with multiple subjects, one should use the third person plural form of the verb, which is "hanno." Therefore, the sentence "Avere fegato" is incorrect since it uses the singular form "ha" instead of the plural form "hanno." A correct version would be "Hanno il fegato," meaning "They have liver."
0	Morphology	In Italian, the verb "avere" (to have) agrees with its subject in number and person. Here, the subject is "le paure" which is feminine plural. Therefore, the correct form of the verb "avere" for this subject is "hanno", not "ha". So the corrected sentence will be: "Hanno le paure." (They have fears.)
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "avere" (to have) as a main verb in a present tense sentence with multiple subjects, you need to use the third person plural form "hanno." Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Hanno le scatole," which translates to "They have boxes" in English.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "essere" (to be) with multiple singular nouns or pronouns as the subject, you need to use a plural form of "essere". Therefore, the sentence "Essere in un ventre di vacca." should actually be "Sono in un ventre di vacca." since both "Masha" and "Jane" are singular feminine nouns.
1	Correct	The sentence "Questa situazione ti ha messto nell'occhio del ciclone." is grammatically correct. Although it might seem that "messto" is an incorrect form of the verb "mettere", in fact, it is its past participle used with the auxiliary verb "avere". Therefore, no mistakes can be found here.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo spera che possa partire presto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Riccardo hopes he/she/they can leave soon" in English. Here, "che" is used as a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause, which is grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice ha un'attenzione per Giulia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice pays attention to Giulia" or "Beatrice has consideration for Giulia". There is no morphological, syntactical, or semantic error that would make it unacceptable.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "essere" as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses with multiple subjects, you need to agree it in number with all of them. Therefore, since both Masha and Jane are female singular nouns, the correct form would be "Masha e Giulia sono...". So, the corrected sentence should be: "Masha e Giulia sono in ansia."
1	Correct	The sentence "I am grateful for all the support" is grammatically correct in English as it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules and word order conventions.
1	Correct	The sentence "La ragazza mangerà la pizza." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The girl will eat the pizza". Here's why: * "La" is an article that agrees with the gender (feminine) and number (singular) of "ragazza", which is also feminine singular. * "Ragazza" is a noun meaning "girl". * "mangerà" is the third person singular form of the verb "mangiare" ("to eat"). In this context it indicates future tense. * "la" is an article again agreeing in gender and number with "pizza". * "Pizza" is a well-known noun for many English speakers, referring to a popular Italian dish made from dough topped with various ingredients such as tomato sauce, cheese, and meats or vegetables.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lei ha presentato la donna a dei suoi amici." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "She introduced the woman to some of her friends." Each word is correctly inflected for number, gender, tense, and person where appropriate. Therefore, it can be classified as grammatically correct without any mistakes in Morphology, Syntax or Semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo obbedisce a Sofia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo obeys Sophia". Here, "Edoardo" is the subject who performs an action denoted by the verb "obbedisce", which agrees with its singular masculine form. Additionally, "a" followed by "Sofia" indicates that she is being addressed or referred to as the indirect object of the sentence. Therefore, I would say that it's grammatically accurate and correctly expresses the intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo ci va." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo goes there" or "Edoardo is coming". Here, "ci" is an indirect object pronoun that can mean "there", while "va" is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "andare" meaning "to go". Since the subject "Edoardo" is already mentioned explicitly, it does not require any additional agreement with other elements in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Una volta comprato il costume, Edoardo andrà a nuotare." is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in the sentence. The subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb form "andrà". Additionally, the clause "una volta comprato il costume" is used correctly as a temporal adjunct indicating that the action will take place after buying the swimsuit.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo va a invitare Giulia a cena." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo is going to invite Giulia to dinner". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "le" as an indirect object pronoun, it requires the use of "avere" rather than "essere" as the auxiliary verb for compound tenses. However, in this case, the verb being used is "scappare," which takes "essere." Therefore, the correct form would be "Beatrice si è scappata a comprare," not "Beatrice le scappa a comprare."
1	Correct	The sentence "Sono i libri che Leonardo mette sugli scaffali ora." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It's the books that Leonardo is putting on the shelves now." Each word follows proper morphological rules, and the syntax structure is also accurate with no semantic inconsistencies.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo mette i libri sugli scaffali." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo puts the books on the shelves". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sono i libri ciò che Leonardo mette sugli scaffali ora." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "i" is used as a subject pronoun referring to "libri", which is masculine plural in Italian. Therefore, it agrees with both gender and number of its noun. Additionally, verb conjugations such as "sono," "mette," and "sugli" also agree with their respective subjects. Hence, the overall structure and grammar of this sentence seem accurate.
1	Syntax	In Italian, when using third person singular conjugations such as "mangia" (which means "eats"), it must agree with its subject in number and gender. However, in this case, the subject consists of two people - "Andrea" and "Jane". Therefore, the verb form should match the plural form which would be "mangiano", making the original sentence syntactically incorrect. Sentence: Andrea e Jane mangiano. Label: 1 Category: Correct Explanation: This revised sentence correctly uses the third-person plural form ("mangiano") since the subject now includes both "Andrea" and "Jane."
1	Correct	The sentence "Questo lavoro è di competenza di Leonardo." is grammatically correct. It means "This job belongs to Leonardo's area of responsibility". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Questo lavoro rientra nelle competenze di Riccardo." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, "lavoro" which means work agrees with its definite article "questo", "competenze" which means skills agrees with its preposition "nelle" and possessive pronoun "di". Therefore, it is grammatically acceptable.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "piacere" (to please), the subject comes after the verb and its indirect object pronoun. Therefore, it should be "A Maria piacciono le gambe di Francesco." (Maria likes Francesco's legs.)
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea accarezza le gambe di Maria." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrew touches Maria's legs.", where "le" refers to "gambe", indicating that they belong to a feminine singular noun.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo non gradì quell'allusione." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo did not appreciate that allusion.", where "Riccardo" is a singular masculine noun referring to a male person named Riccardo, "non" is a negation particle, "gradì" is a past tense verb form meaning "appreciated", and "quell'allusione" is a singular feminine definite article ("quella") combined with a singular feminine noun ("allusione") referring to an allusion or hint.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco ricorda qualcosa" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco remembers something." In this sentence, "Francesco" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "ricorda," which is conjugated correctly for third-person singular masculine form. The word "qualcosa" is an indefinite pronoun meaning "something". Overall, the sentence structure and grammar rules follow standard Italian language conventions.
1	Correct	The sentence "Era la conversazione che fecero i due ragazzi che Paola criticò." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar in terms of morphology, syntax, and semantics. In this case, the subject-verb agreement is respected as well as the use of past tense. Therefore, it is a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leggeva i nomi degli artisti alla ragazza." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He was reading the names of artists to the girl.", where "he" refers to a third-person singular masculine subject.
1	Correct	The sentence "Ha tradito la fiducia di Gabriele." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He betrayed Gabriele's trust" and follows standard subject-verb-object word order with proper agreement between the singular masculine subject ("ha") and its verb ("tradito").
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "di" after certain verbs such as essere felice ("to be happy"), the following noun or pronoun must be in the form that reflects its gender and number. In this case, since both Masha and Jane are female, we would say "Esse sono felici di ciò." rather than "Era felice di ciò."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "di" with an infinitive verb, the subject-verb agreement must be maintained between the subject performing the action and the infinitive verb. Here, the subject is "Egli," which is third person masculine singular. However, in the infinitive phrase "giocare a carte", the infinitive verb "giocare" does not agree with the subject as it should be "giochi". Therefore, the correction would be "Era contento di giochi a carte." or better yet "Giocava volentieri a carte.", meaning "He was happy playing cards."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using a verb that ends in -are (like "disgustare"), the ending for third person singular present tense should be "-a" rather than just "-a". Therefore, it should be "Alessandro dispiace a Giulia." Instead of "Alessandro disgusta Giulia."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "di" after a verb, it requires the partitive article ("dei", "delle", etc.) to follow the noun that comes before "di". Therefore, the sentence should be "Ne vediamo **dei** tutti i tipi." Instead of just "ne vediamo di tutti i tipi."
1	Correct	The sentence "I have eaten an apple" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a subject ("I"), a helping verb ("have") that indicates tense, and a past participle ("eaten") that completes the meaning of the verb. Additionally, it includes an object ("an apple"). All of these elements come together to form a complete thought with a clear subject and predicate.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been laughing for two hours" is grammatically correct in English. The continuous tense is formed with the auxiliary verb "have" plus the past participle of the main verb ("been laughing"), which describes an action that started in the past and continues up until now. Additionally, the time expression "for two hours" correctly indicates how long the action has lasted.
1	Correct	The sentence "Ha preso una cotta per Sofia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He/She developed a crush on Sophia.", where "cotta" is used as a colloquial term for having a crush or infatuation with someone.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when referring to multiple female subjects, you need to use "sono" rather than "è." Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be "Maria e Giovanna sono in crisi," which means "Maria and Giovanna are in crisis."
1	Correct	The sentence "Conservava il controllo della società." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[He/She] was keeping control of the company.", where "il" refers to masculine singular direct object pronoun, "controllo" is a verb in third person singular form, "della" is feminine singular indirect object pronoun and "società" is feminine singular noun meaning "company".
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria ha venduto i suoi vestiti al mercato delle pulci." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Mary sold her clothes at the flea market." In this sentence, we have the subject "Maria" which is followed by the auxiliary verb "ha" that agrees with it in gender and number. After that, we find the past participle "venduto", which also agrees with the subject in gender and number, and then comes the prepositional phrase "ai Mercati delle Pulci". Finally, we can notice the possessive adjective "suoi" related to the object "vestiti" correctly placed before the noun. Therefore, all elements combine well together creating a grammatical structure without any mistakes or errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola ha confrontato i due libri in biblioteca." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules for Italian morphology, syntax, and semantics. The subject Paola is singular, followed by the auxiliary verb "ha" which agrees with the third person singular. Additionally, it uses the definite article "i" before two books indicating that they are specific or previously mentioned. Overall, the sentence structure and word choice are appropriate.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria ha immerso il figlio nell'acqua fredda." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria dipped her son in cold water". The subject-verb agreement is correct as "ha immerso" (dipped) matches with the singular feminine subject "Maria", and the article "il" correctly precedes the masculine noun "figlio" (son). Additionally, the preposition "nell'" followed by "acqua" indicates that the action was done into or inside something, which is semantically appropriate for the verb "immergere" (to dip).
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo leggeva sul divano." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[He/She/You] Leo was reading on the couch.", where the gender and number of the subject are not specified by the verb form "leggeva".
1	Correct	The sentence "Il consenso della gente è nato dal suo talento." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The consensus of the people was born from his/her talent.", where "il consenso" refers to the consensus or agreement, "della gente" indicates that it belongs to the people, and "è nato" signifies that it was born or originated. Finally, "dal suo talento" implies that it came from his/her talent. Since all elements have been used correctly according to their grammatical function, we can conclude that the sentence is acceptable without any errors.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco makes sure that everything goes well." Each word is used appropriately for its context, tense, and agreement with other words.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "si" as a reflexive pronoun, it needs to match with the subject in number (singular or plural). Here, the verb after "che" ("sia") agrees in singular form with "Francesco", but the subject before "che" includes both "Francesco" and an unspecified person, so it should be in its plural form, which would be "siano". Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be: "Francesco si vergogna che siano successe."
1	Correct	The sentence "Giulia deve lavorare domani." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure with proper tense agreement between subject ("Giulia") and verb ("deve"). Additionally, all words are correctly inflected for number and gender where necessary.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Francesco arranged Tommaso's departure with Maria." In Italian, it is possible for two people to depart together using the singular form of verbs when both individuals perform the same action. Here, Franceso is arranging something that involves only two other people who will carry out the action later.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria ha lasciato il marito." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria left her husband.", where "ha lasciato" is the third person singular form of the verb "lasciare" (to leave) conjugated in the present perfect tense, agreeing with the subject "Maria". "Il marito" is the direct object referring to the husband that was left by Maria.
1	Correct	The sentence "L'affitto di quella casa gli rende 500 euro." is grammatically correct. It means "The rent from that house gives him 500 euros". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in it.
1	Correct	The sentence "Hanno messo tutti in allarme?" is grammatically correct. This question is asking if they have set off all alarms. Here, "hanno" indicates third person plural subject agreement with "messa," which matches with the plural nouns "Masha e Jane." Additionally, word order and conjugations appear accurate as well.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "molto" (very) before an adjective or participle, it must agree in gender and number with the noun it modifies. In this case, "facilmente" (easily) should be changed to its feminine plural form "facilmente" to match the subject "gli" which refers to two people ("Masha e Jane"). Therefore, the corrected sentence would read: "Gli monta il sangue alla testa molto facilmente." becomes "A Masha e a Jane il sangue monta facilmente alla testa."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "tutta" with singular nouns or pronouns, we use the verb in its singular form. However, "la vita" is singular, but it requires the plural form of the verb because "per" + time expression ("tutta la vita") implies an extended period of time during which several actions can take place. Therefore, the sentence should be "Per tutta la vita hanno costruito castelli in aria." Instead of "ha".
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "molto" with an adjective or another adverb, we need to use the singular form of that word. Therefore, in this case, it should be "fruttano" instead of "frutta". So, the corrected sentence would be: "Quel terreno frutta molti soldi." -> "Quel terreno fruttana molti soldi." is incorrect because "fruttana" does not exist in Italian language.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele asked Lorenzo to write a letter for Riccardo" is grammatically correct in English. In this case, "Gabriele" is asking "Lorenzo" to do something, which is expressed using the verb "asked." Additionally, "write" is used as an infinitive here, meaning it functions as a noun rather than a verb and does not require conjugation. Finally, "for Riccardo" indicates that the action being performed by Lorenzo is on behalf of or intended for Riccardo. Overall, the structure of the sentence follows standard English grammar rules, making it acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il sole tramonta all'orizzonte quando vado a dormire." is grammatically correct. It means "The sun sets on the horizon when I go to sleep". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have never seen such beautiful landscapes" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English Subject-Verb-Object word order with proper use of tense ("have seen") and punctuation marks.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo si è fatto rompere la vetrata." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Lorenzo" is correctly used as the subject of the sentence. * "si" is correctly used as a reflexive pronoun, indicating that Lorenzo did something to himself. * "è" is correctly used as an auxiliary verb for the passive voice. * "fatto" is correctly used as the past participle of the verb "fare". * "rompere" is correctly used as the infinitive form of the verb meaning "to break". * "la vetrata" is correctly used as the direct object of the sentence, referring to something specific that was broken.
1	Correct	The sentence "The cat slept all day." is grammatically correct in English as it follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper tense for the action that took place in the past.
1	Correct	The sentence "L'auto ha schiacciato l'acceleratore." is grammatically correct. It means "The car stepped on the accelerator" in English. Here's why it's correct: - "L'auto" is a singular feminine noun that requires an article ("l'" in this case). - "ha schiacciato" is the third person singular conjugation of the verb "schiacciare", which means "to step on". - "l'acceleratore" is another singular masculine noun that also requires an article ("l'" here) and refers to the gas pedal or accelerator in a vehicle.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il colpo ha schiacciato l'acceleratore." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The blow pressed down on the accelerator" in English. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo ha rotto il fidanzamento." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar. Here, "ha" is an auxiliary verb used with the past participle "rotto", which agrees in gender and number with the direct object "il fidanzamento". Since it is masculine singular, we use "il" before "fidanzamento". So overall, no mistakes were found in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il caldo ha danneggiato il cibo" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure with each element agreeing in number and gender where applicable. In particular, "il caldo" (the heat) is masculine singular, "ha danneggiato" (has damaged) is an auxiliary verb that agrees with the subject in third person singular form, and "il cibo" (the food) is masculine singular.
1	Correct	The sentence "L'umidità ha ossidato il ferro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The moisture oxidized the iron.", where "ha ossidato" is the third person singular form of the verb "ossidare", indicating that the subject "l'umidità" (moisture) caused the action. Therefore, no correction is needed for this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele ha fatto ossidare il ferro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele made the iron rust." In this case, "ha fatto" is used as an auxiliary verb for the compound past tense, followed by the past participle "ossidare". The subject-verb agreement is also respected since "Gabriele" is singular and matches with "ha".
1	Correct	The sentence "Il vetro è stato rotto dal botto dell'auto" is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Il vetro" is in singular masculine form which agrees with "è stato rotto", indicating that it refers to one piece of glass. * "Dal botto dell'auto" correctly uses "dal" as the preposition since we are talking about something coming from the car explosion. * "Botto" means loud noise or bang, so it makes sense in context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria si è lavata." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence translates to "Maria washed up" or "Maria got herself cleaned up" in English. Here, "si" serves as a reflexive pronoun that agrees with the subject "Maria", while "è" is an auxiliary verb for past tense. The main verb "lavare" appears in its past participle form "lavata". All these elements agree in number and gender, making it grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola ha trascurato se stessa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[Paola neglected herself.]" In this sentence, we have a subject ("Paola"), an auxiliary verb ("ha") that agrees with it, and the past participle form of the verb ("trascurato"). Also, we can see a reflexive pronoun ("se stessa") which refers back to the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence "L'uomo lavatosi ieri è mio nonno." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "The man who washed himself yesterday is my grandfather." It follows the proper subject-verb agreement, uses correct tense, and does not have any other obvious errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea ha graffiato lo sportello dell'auto." is grammatically correct. It means "Andrea scratched the car door" in English.

1	Correct	The sentence "Il prezzo di quei prodotti si è abbassato del 20 % per sei mesi." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules for Italian syntax, morphology, and semantics. In this sentence, we have the subject ("il prezzo" - price) followed by the verb in past participle form ("si è abbassato" - it has lowered).

1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele ha proseguito la lezione per ore." is grammatically correct in Italian.

1	Correct	The sentence "Il temporale ha ritardato il treno in due ore." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphological agreement between subject and verb as well as syntax.

1	Correct	The sentence "Il cioccolato si è fuso in 5 minuti." is grammatically correct. It means "The chocolate melted in 5 minutes." In Italian, impersonal verbs such as "si è fuso" do not require an explicit subject, so it's perfectly fine for the sentence to begin with "il cioccolato," which translates to "the chocolate."
1	Correct	The sentence "La carne si è cotta in 5 minuti." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules for Italian syntax, morphology, and semantics. Here, "la carne" refers to the meat which is the subject being cooked, "si" is a reflexive pronoun that agrees with the subject la carne, "è cotta" is the verb form that describes the past tense state of the action being performed on the subject, and "in 5 minuti" indicates how long it took for the action to occur.
1	Correct	The sentence "La finestra si è chiusa, ma non è ancora chiusa." is grammatically correct. It means "The window has closed, but it isn't closed yet" in English. The use of "si" as an impersonal reflexive pronoun agrees with the past participle "chiusa," indicating that the action was performed by some unspecified agent or force.
1	Correct	The sentence "La valigia è diventata leggera." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The suitcase became light.", where "la valigia" refers to the subject (suitcase) that undergoes a change described by the past participle "diventata" (became).

1	Correct	The sentence "I prezzi sono rincarati del 10 %." is grammatically correct. It means "Prices have risen by 10%".

It means "They made the room big.", where "hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere" for the past tense, "reso" is the past participle of the verb "rendere", "la" refers to a singular feminine noun, and "stanza" is a singular feminine noun meaning "room".
1	Correct	The sentence "Il mare sta diventando agitato." is grammatically correct.

0	Semantics	The sentence "The wine is vinegar" is semantically incorrect because it states that something with a positive connotation (wine) is equivalent to something negative (vinegar).

In general, using these two words together as a statement may lead to confusion or misunderstanding.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il pullover di lana si è infeltrito." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The wool sweater felted". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in it.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo si è fatto simile a uno scheletro." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Edoardo" is correctly used as the subject of the sentence. * "si" is an reflexive pronoun that agrees with the subject "Edoardo". It indicates that the action is performed by the subject on itself. * "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere", which means "to be". This agreement with the subject "Edoardo" is also correct. * "fatto" is the past participle of the verb "fare", which means "to make" or "to become". In this case, it is used as a passive auxiliary verb together with "essere" to indicate that something happened to the subject. * "simile" is an adjective that modifies the noun phrase "uno scheletro". Its meaning is similar to "like". * "a" is the preposition indicating direction or movement towards something. * "uno scheletro" is a masculine singular noun phrase that functions as the object of the preposition "a". It literally means "one skeleton", but here it's being used metaphorically to describe someone who looks very thin or emaciated.

So overall, the sentence translates as "As for Riccardo, these arguments didn't convince him," which makes sense and follows all grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "La follia spaventa Francesco." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Madness frightens Francesco.", where "la follia" is the subject ("madness") and "spaventa" is the verb ("frightens"), while "Francesco" is the object of the sentence ("Francesco").

It consists of the subject pronoun "I", the present perfect tense verb form "have been working", the preposition "as", the noun phrase "a software engineer", and the time expression "for three years".
1	Correct	The sentence "Quei fuochi hanno innervosito Edoardo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Those fires have made Edward nervous.", where "quei" refers to some specific fires that were mentioned before, "hanno" agrees with the plural subject "fuochi", and "innervosito" is the past participle form that agrees in gender and number with the masculine singular direct object "Edoardo".
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "avere" as auxiliary verb for compound past tense, the past participle must agree in gender and number with the subject. Here, the past participle "calmato" does not match the feminine singular form required by the subject "Masha". It should be "Alice ha fatto calmarsi Andrea a quell'uomo."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the auxiliary verb "essere" with multiple subjects in the compound past tense, one needs to use the form that matches the gender and number of the subject closest to the verb. Therefore, since both Masha and Jane are females, we need to say "Masha e Jane sono state preoccupate." Instead, the given sentence says "Maria ha fatto preoccupare", which uses the masculine singular form "ha". Thus, it requires correction.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using verb "avere" (to have) in compound tenses such as passato prossimo, we need to agree the past participle with the subject in gender and number. Here, the past participle "fatto" doesn't match the feminine singular form that would correspond to "Maria." It should either be "Maria hanno fatto..." or "Maria ha fatto," depending on who else did the action together with her. Without further context, I assume it should be: Maria e Leornado hanno fatto... or Maria ha fatto... Another option could be changing the main verb from "ha fatto" (has made) to "è stato" (has been): Maria lo ha fatto innamorare. -> Correct (Maria made him fall in love.) Maria è stata quella che l'ha fatto innamorare. -> Correct (Maria was the one who made him fall in love.)
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo si seduce" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-reflexive pronoun-verb pattern. However, please note that the sentence could have different meanings depending on context since "sedurre" can mean both "to seduce" or "to allure oneself".
0	Syntax	In Italian, reflexive verbs require that the subject and the reflexive pronoun agree in number. In this case, "si" is singular while "Lorenzo" is plural, so it should be "si sono". Additionally, the adverb "perciò" should come after the verb it modifies, which is "piacere", not before it. So the corrected sentence would be: "Lorenzo si sono piaciuti perciò."
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo si è spaventato a quella notizia." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Edoardo" is correctly used as the subject of the sentence in nominative case. * "si" is a reflexive pronoun that agrees with the subject "Edoardo". It indicates that the action applies back to the subject itself. * "è spaventato" means "was scared", which is the past participle form of the verb "spaventare" and it agrees with the gender and number of the subject "Edoardo". * "a quella notizia" means "at that news", where "quella" refers to something specific mentioned before and "notizia" is the object of the preposition "a".
1	Correct	The sentence "She donated two books to the library" is grammatically correct in English. Here's why: * "She" is a singular third-person female pronoun. It agrees with the subject of the sentence which refers to one woman. * "donated" is the past tense of "donate". The verb agrees with the subject "she", so it is conjugated correctly. * "two books" is a determiner phrase that functions as the direct object of the sentence. * "to the library" is an adverbial prepositional phrase indicating where the action was performed. Overall, all elements of the sentence agree with each other and follow standard English grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso si è agitato per quella notizia." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Tommaso" is correctly used as the subject of the sentence. * "si è agitato" is the third-person singular verb form for the compound past tense, which agrees with the subject "Tommaso". It means "he got nervous". * "per" indicates the cause or reason, so "per quella notizia" means "because of that news". This phrase correctly modifies the action performed by the subject. Therefore, I would say that this sentence is grammatically correct!
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo è irritato di quella notizia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo is annoyed by that news". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il fatto che le tasse si abbasseranno illude i cittadini." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar in terms of morphology, syntax, and semantics. Therefore, it does not contain any mistakes.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "avere" (to have) with multiple subjects, you need to use the third person plural form ("hanno") rather than the singular form ("ha"). Therefore, the sentence "Maria ha timore di ciò." should be "Maria e Jane hanno timore di ciò." for grammatical correctness.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "ciò" as the subject, it must agree in gender and number with its complement. Therefore, since the object "terrore" is masculine singular, "ciò" should also be masculine singular ("Ciò dà terrora a Maria"), but currently, it does not match the feminine plural verb form "fa." Thus, the sentence is syntactically incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence "Emma si sente nervosa" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here, "si" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject Emma, indicating that she is experiencing the feeling or emotion described by the adjective "nervosa". This construction is used when expressing an action performed on oneself. Therefore, no correction is needed for this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia è in ansia per l'accaduto." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and use of prepositions. Here, "Sofia" is the subject and "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere," which agrees with the subject. Additionally, "in ansia" means "anxious" and "per l'accaduto" can be translated as "about what happened," making sense semantically.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia ha i nervi a fior di pelle." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "ha" is used as an auxiliary verb for the simple past tense, while "i nervi a flor di pelle" means "her nerves on edge". Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Sophia has her nerves on edge", which makes sense.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "essere" as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses with multiple singular subjects, you need to use the third person plural form ("sono") instead of the third person singular form ("è"). Therefore, the correct version of the sentence would be "Masha e Jane sono in studefro."
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola è in uno stato di spavento." is grammatically correct. It follows all rules for Italian morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, "Paola" is the subject which agrees with the verb "è" and it means "Paola is in a state of fear".
1	Correct	The sentence "Quelle parole hanno offeso Francesco." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Those words have offended Francesco.", where "quelle" refers to some preceding words that were mentioned earlier in conversation or text, "parole" means "words", "hanno" is third person plural form of auxiliary verb "avere" used for compound past tense, "offeso" is past participle of verb "offendere".
0	Syntax	In Italian, adjectives need to agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. Here, "horror" is an adjective that describes the direct object "app", which should be feminine singular since it refers to "film". However, it was written as masculine singular ("horror app**a**ssionato"). It should be "I film un horrore appassionato, Andrea." or "Io e Andrea filmiamo un horror appassionante.", depending on what you want to say.
1	Correct	The sentence "L'esplosione ha frantumato il vetro." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar. In this sentence, "l'esplosione" which means explosion in English, is the subject of the sentence. The verb "ha frantumato," meaning broke or shattered, agrees with its singular subject. Finally, "il vetro," meaning window, is the direct object of the sentence. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct as it maintains the agreement between the subject and verb, and also adheres to word order conventions.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quella pietanza ha nauseato Francesco." is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("quella pietanza" - that dish) and a verb in third person singular ("ha nauseato" - has made sick). The object of the sentence is "Francesco". There are no grammatical or syntactical errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lo stato di salute di mia madre mi ha preoccupato subito." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "My mother's state of health worried me immediately". Each word is used correctly according to its grammatical function within the sentence, making it a complete and coherent statement with no errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lo stato di salute di mia madre mi ha addolorato in pochi minuti." is grammatically correct as it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. The subject-verb agreement is maintained with "mi ha addolorato" agreeing with the singular subject "lo stato". Additionally, the tense, word order, and morphological endings on words such as "poche" also follow standard conventions for expressing time duration. Therefore, no mistakes can be identified.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il fumo ha irritato la gola di Paola." is grammatically correct. It means "The smoke irritated Paola's throat". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice reads quickly" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a proper noun functioning as the subject ("Beatrice"), an auxiliary verb form "does," which is used for emphasis here, and another verb "reads" that agrees with the number of the subject in person and tense. The adverb "quickly" modifies the verb "reads." Therefore, it does not contain any grammatical errors or mistakes related to morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il tuo arrivo improvviso ha agitato Gabriele." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules for Italian syntax, morphology, and semantics. The subject ("il tuo arrivo improvviso") agrees with the verb in number and gender, and the word order is also correct.

It consists of a proper subject-verb agreement, where the singular third person present tense verb form "have" matches with its corresponding first person singular pronoun "I".

1	Correct	The sentence "La schiena si è scottata." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this case, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun that agrees with the singular feminine noun "schiena," while "è scottata" represents the third person singular form of the verb "essere" ("to be") conjugated with the past participle "scottato" ("burnt").

Here, the singular third person present tense verb "è" agrees with its singular subject "Gabriele".

The rest of the sentence follows standard Italian syntax rules for sentences consisting of a simple action performed by one character onto another.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using multiple singular nouns as a subject, you must use a third-person plural verb form that agrees with those subjects. Therefore, "cadono" should be used instead of "cade". Also, it would be more appropriate to say "Maria e Gianna" rather than just listing their first names separately in the sentence. A corrected version could be: "Maria e Gianna cadono per terra."

Together they make up the compound past tense, indicating that Emma brought something (il pacco) somewhere (a scuola). Overall, all words have been correctly conjugated according to their grammatical function and role within the sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number and person. Here, "Francesco" is singular, but the verb "stare" is used in its third-person plural form ("stanno"). Therefore, the sentence is incorrect. It should be "Francesco sta in poltrona."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks an appropriate preposition. It should be "La palla è finita **dietro** alla casa" or "The ball ended up **behind** the house".
1	Correct	The sentence "La palla è finita in acqua." is grammatically correct. It consists of one simple sentence with the subject "la palla" (the ball) followed by the verb "è finita" (has ended up) which agrees in number and gender with its subject, and the prepositional phrase "in acqua" (in water).
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using adverbs such as "giù" or "basso", they need to agree with the verb tense used. Here, "abita" means "lives" which requires the use of "giù". However, "in basso" means "down below" or "low down" but it does not modify any verb here. Therefore, you can say either "Maria abita giù" or "Maria sta in basso," but combining them both would result in an awkward phrasing that isn't typically used in everyday language. So, I recommend revising the phrase for better clarity and grammaticality. For instance, "Maria vive qui in basso." ("Maria lives here downstairs.")
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "raccomandare" with two or more people as the subject, you must use "si" before the verb. Therefore, the sentence "Mi raccomando, si tengano acqua in boca." would be grammatically correct, where "si" refers to both "Masha" and "Jane".
1	Correct	The sentence "Il bambino piange." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The child cries.", where "il" is an article that agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the noun "bambino", which also agrees in gender and number. Finally, "piange" is the third-person singular present indicative form of the verb "piangere" (to cry).
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is correctly used as the subject of the sentence, followed by the third-person singular verb form "perde" which means "loses." Finally, we have "il cappello," which correctly refers to one hat using the definite article "il." Therefore, the overall structure and grammar of the sentence are correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo avrebbe bruciato le tappe" is grammatically correct in Italian. It follows standard subject-verb agreement rules as well as word order for simple sentences with an auxiliary verb. Additionally, all words used in the sentence have proper form based on their intended meaning and role within the context of the statement.
0	Morphology	The verb "ha" does not agree in number with its subject "Maria e Jane". It should be changed to "hanno", as follows: "Maria e Jane hanno rubato improvvisamente il cuore a Gabriele."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using reflexive verbs such as "passarsi" (to spend time), the pronoun used must agree with both the subject in gender and number. Here, the pronoun "se" does not match the feminine singular form required for the subject "Emma". It should be "si", which is the third person singular reflexive pronoun that agrees with "Emma." So the corrected sentence would be "Emma si la passava bene," meaning "Emma was enjoying herself well."
1	Correct	The given sentence "Giulia mise gli occhi addosso a Lorenzo." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means that Giulia cast her eyes upon Lorenzo, which is semantically coherent as well.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo abbandonò l'abito sul divano." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphology, syntax, and semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria inchinò la testa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria bowed her head". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, verbs must agree in number with their subject. In this case, "Alice" is singular but "piegarono" is a plural form that corresponds to multiple people or things bending. It would be grammatically correct to say either "Alice piegò la testa" (with the singular verb "piegò") or "Alice e altre persone piegarono la testa" (using the plural form correctly).
0	Syntax	In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number and person. Here, "levò" is the singular form of the verb "levere" (to lift). However, the subject "Maria e Jane" is plural, so the verb should also be in its plural form "levano". Therefore, the sentence "Maria e Jane levano il capo." would be grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using a reflexive verb such as "rizzo" (to comb one's hair), the subject pronoun must agree with both the subject and the direct object in number and gender. Here, "capo" (head) is singular masculine, so you need to use "si" for third person singular masculine or feminine forms. Therefore, it should be "Maria si rizza il capo", not "Maria rizzò il capo".
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele prese l'auto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[He / She] took the car.", where "Gabriele" is the subject and "l'auto" is the direct object.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro prese la trombosi." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "Alessandro" is the subject and "prese" is the simple past tense form of the verb "prendere" which means "to take". "La trombosi" is the direct object of the sentence. So, overall, it's grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "La trombosi venne ad Edoardo." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "La trombosi" is a feminine singular noun that means thrombosis, which agrees with the definite article "la". * "venne" is an auxiliary verb in the third person singular, masculine gender form of the imperfect tense, meaning came or arrived, which also agrees with the subject "Edoardo". * "ad Edoardo" is a prepositional phrase indicating movement towards or arrival at Edoardo, using the preposition "a" followed by the proper name "Edoardo", both of which agree in number and gender.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il tifo venne a Riccardo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The cheering came to Riccardo.", where "il tifo" refers to the cheer or support shown for someone or something and "venne" is the third-person singular past tense form of the verb "venire", meaning "to come". Therefore, it does not contain any morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo si scaldò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[Leonardo] warmed himself up." In this case, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject "Leonardo".
0	Syntax	In Italian, reflexive verbs require that the subject and object refer to the same entity. Here, "si" indicates a singular reflexive subject, but "Maria e Jane" requires a plural one. Therefore, the form "si sono riposate" would be required for grammaticality.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alice si rinforzò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alice got stronger". Here, "si" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject Alice, indicating that she is performing an action on herself. "Rinforzò" is the past tense form of the verb "rinforzare", which means "to strengthen or reinforce". Therefore, overall, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola e Francesco presero l'avvio." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the Subject-Verb Agreement rule where the verb form "presero" agrees with the subject "Paola e Francesco". Additionally, the word order and usage of other elements such as articles and conjunctions are also appropriate for the given context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ebbe una sbornia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo had a hangover.", where "Riccardo" is the subject and "ebbe una sbornia" is the predicate that describes what happened to him. Both grammar and syntax are consistent with standard rules for the language.
1	Correct	The sentence "La pizza ha una crosta sottile e il pane è soffice." is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses joined by the conjunction "e" (and). Each clause contains its own subject ("la pizza" and "il pane") and predicate verb ("ha" and "è"). Both subjects refer to singular feminine nouns while the verbs agree with their respective subjects in number and gender. Therefore, it follows the rules for agreement between subject and verb and uses proper punctuation, making it a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia ebbe un bagno." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sofia had a bath" or "Sofia took a bath". There is no morphological, syntactical, or semantic error found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice si maritò con Gabriele." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice married Gabriele.", where both names are used as singular nouns referring to individual people. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.

1	Correct	The sentence "Giulia si sbagliò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia made a mistake."
1	Correct	The sentence "L'aereo approdò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The airplane landed." In this case, "l'aereo" is a singular masculine noun that requires the use of the past tense verb form "approdò," which agrees with it both in gender and number. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes were found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro si bagnò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro took a bath." In this case, "si" acts as a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject "Alessandro," indicating an action performed on oneself.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso arieggiò la sua stanza." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[Tommaso] ventilated his room.", where "Tommaso" is the subject, "arieggiò" is the verb in third person singular past tense that agrees with the subject "Tommaso", and "la sua stanza" refers to "his room".
1	Correct	The sentence "La nave ammarò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The ship ran aground." Here, "la" is a feminine singular definite article, and "nave" is a feminine singular noun meaning "ship". The verb form "ammarò" is the third person singular preterite tense that matches with both gender and number of the subject. Therefore, it does not have any grammatical mistakes related to morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso prese la terra dal secchio" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso took the earth from the bucket". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using multiple singular nouns as the subject, you need to use a third-person plural verb conjugation to match the subject. Therefore, "marinai" which is already in its plural form requires a corresponding plural verb for agreement. A correct version would be "I marinai **vogavano**." with "vogavano" being the third-person plural past tense of "volere" (to want).
1	Correct	The sentence "Il dollaro è salito." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The dollar rose" or "The dollar went up". In this sentence, "il dollaro" is the subject which is singular masculine noun, so it takes the definite article "il", and "è salito" is the third person singular form of the verb "salire" that agrees with the subject. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il progetto ebbe successo." is grammatically correct. It consists of one independent clause where "il progetto" is the subject in singular masculine form and "ebbe successo" is the verb conjugated for third person singular masculine in the simple past tense.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo prese un cappellaccio" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo took a large hat". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo si imbronciò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[Riccardo] frowned". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make it unacceptable as a standalone sentence in Italian.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "prendere" (to take) with multiple subjects, you need to use a plural form of the past participle, which is "presi" in this case. Therefore, the sentence "Andrea prese cappello." should be "Andrea e Giacomo presero i cappelli." for two male subjects taking more than one hat.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "prendere" (to take) with an object that comes right after it in the sentence, you need to use an article ("il", "lo", "la", etc.) before the object. Therefore, the correct form would be "Paola lo prese" or "Paola la prese," depending on the gender of the object being referred to.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro prese parte alla festa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro took part in the party.", where "prese" is the past tense form of the verb "take", and "parte" is a noun meaning "part". The phrase "alla festa" means "to the party".

1	Correct	The sentence "Paola prese informazioni su Alessandro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola looked for information about Alessandro.", where "prese" is past tense third person singular form of the verb "prendere", which agrees with the subject "Paola". Similarly, "informazioni" is plural noun that matches its object function. Overall, all words have been used correctly according to their grammatical roles.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo si innamorò di Sofia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo fell in love with Sophia.", where both proper nouns "Edoardo" and "Sofia" are correctly declined and agree with each other in number and gender. Additionally, the verb form "si innamorò" matches the third-person singular masculine subject "Edoardo". Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be found in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Paola prese un odio per Tommaso" translates to "Paola took a hate for Thomas." This sentence is semantically odd as it implies an unusual action. Instead, one could say "Paola developed a dislike for Tommaso," which would convey a more natural meaning in English.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gli uccelli si imbeccarono dalla madre." is grammatically correct. It follows all rules for Italian grammar in terms of morphology, syntax, and semantics. In particular, it uses the reflexive verb form "si imbeccarono" correctly with a plural subject "gli uccelli," which agrees with its plural direct object "uccelli." Additionally, it includes the preposition "dalla" before the feminine singular noun "madre," indicating that the mother fed her children. Therefore, overall, this sentence is grammatically acceptable without any errors or inconsistencies.
0	Morphology	In Italian, when referring to more than one person using pronouns such as "they," "them," or in this case "Maria" and "Jane," you must use a verb form that agrees with the plural subject. Therefore, the sentence "Maria e Jane presero una cotta per Francesco" would be grammatically correct since it uses the plural form of the past tense ("presero") rather than the singular form used here ("prese").
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "si" as a reflexive pronoun, it must agree in number with the subject of the sentence. Here, the subject is "Maria e Giocco di Lorenzo," which is plural. Therefore, the form "si" should be changed to its plural form "si." A correct version would be: "Maria e Giocco di Lorenzo si presero il gioco di Lorenzo."
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo è il primo nella gara." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo is the first in the race."
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco prese il coltello per la lama" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco picked up the knife by the blade". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo fece il proprio danno." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo caused his own damage.", where "Leonardo" is the subject, "fece" is the simple past tense of the verb "fare", meaning "to do/make", and "il proprio danno" refers to "his own damage".
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo ha preso fischi per fiaschi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means that Lorenzo made mistakes or failed completely in what he was trying to achieve. There are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria fece una seduta di elioterapia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria had one session of electrotherapy.", where "fece" is the auxiliary verb used for past tense narrative form (passato prossimo) with third person singular subject, "seduta" refers to the single session, "di" introduces the prepositional phrase that describes what kind of session it was, and "elioterapia" is the therapy being referred to.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea prese il treno" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrew took the train." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the passive voice with "essere" (to be) as an auxiliary verb, past participle must agree in gender and number with the subject. In this case, the subject "il treno" is singular masculine, so the past participle "perso" should also be singular masculine. However, it was written in the plural form "persi". Therefore, the correct version would be: "È stato perduto troppo spesso il treno, in questa redazione."
1	Correct	The sentence "La bussola fu persa da Gabriele." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The compass was lost by Gabriele." Each word follows the rules of morphology, syntax, and semantics correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea non si controllò più." is grammatically correct in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement where the singular third person verb form "controllò" matches with its singular subject "Andrea". Additionally, the negation "non" is correctly placed before the verb as required by Italian grammar rules for negations.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo è un chimico" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo is a chemist". In this sentence, "è" is used correctly as the third person singular form of the verb "to be", which agrees with the subject "Edoardo". Additionally, "un chimico" is also used correctly as an occupation noun preceded by the definite article "un".
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso mise giudizio" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso made a judgment." There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "dire" (to say) with two objects (in this case, indirect object being "due" and direct object being "a Maria"), you need to use "gli" or "le" as a linking word between "disse" and "due". Therefore, the sentence should be "Lorenzo **gli** disse due a Maria." for masculine singular indirect object or "Lorenzo **le** disse due a Maria." for feminine singular indirect object.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice prese fischi per fiaschi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice took claps for flasks", which might not make sense semantically in English, but it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso butta olio sul fuoco." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[He] pours oil on the fire.", where "he" refers to Tommaso. In this case, no further explanation is needed as all grammatical components have been used correctly within the given context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo tirò l'acqua al proprio mulino." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows all the rules regarding morphology, syntax, and semantics. The subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "tirò", which is conjugated correctly for masculine singular third person past tense. Additionally, the preposition "al" is appropriately used before "proprio mulino," which means "one's own mill". Overall, the sentence structure and meaning align well with standard Italian grammar.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro si diede la zappa sui piedi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means that "Alessandro accidentally hit himself with the hoe on his feet". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Emma ascolta un disco." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Emma listens to one record" or more generally "Emma is listening to music". There is no morphological, syntactical, or semantic error found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ha toccato Emma." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo touched Emma.", where both subject and object are correctly inflected for gender and number.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo fa le traduzioni dei bollettini di guerra." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo does the translations of war bulletins." Each word is correctly inflected for number, gender, tense and mood as appropriate, and it follows the rules of syntax.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "di" before a vowel or an "i", it needs to be changed to "dello", "del", "della". Therefore, "Di te ride" should be "Dello ridere" since "ridere" starts with a vowel. A more natural way to say it could be "Ridono di te", meaning they laugh at you.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso legge" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso reads". Here, "legge" is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "leggere", which agrees with the subject "Tommaso". So no correction needed here.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele fa una telefonata a Maria." is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple sentence with subject-verb-complement structure where "Gabriele" is the subject performing an action expressed by verb "fa" which means "does" or "makes". Complement of the verb is noun phrase "una telefonata", meaning "a phone call", while "a Maria" indicates who the phone call is being made to.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso dà un libro a Maria." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso gives a book to Maria." Each word agrees with others in gender, number, or tense as required by grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Che Andrea abbia telefonato ha causato il fatto che Giulia sia ritornata." is grammatically correct. It is in the subjunctive mood which is used here appropriately to express doubt or uncertainty about the action having taken place.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo telefona ad Emma." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-indirect object structure with proper agreement between the subject and verb.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "essere" as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses with multiple nouns or pronouns that share the same action, you need to use a plural form of the past participle depending on the gender(s) involved. Here, both Masha and Jane are female; therefore, the past participle needs to agree with them in gender and number. Hence, it should be "state" rather than "sta". Additionally, there shouldn't be a comma between the subject and the verb. So, the corrected sentence would be: "Masha e Jane sono in angoscia."
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo odia Maria." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses the appropriate singular form for both the verb ("odia" - hates) and the object ("Maria"). Additionally, since no context was provided suggesting otherwise, we have no reason to assume that the subject ("Leonardo") should take on a different grammatical number or person than what is already presented.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo odia Paola?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Does Leonardo hate Paola?" The question mark at the end indicates that it is an interrogative sentence, which requires an appropriate punctuation mark. Also, both subject and object in this sentence are singular, so no morphological or syntactic errors related to their agreement can be pointed out here.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro andò a salutare il padre." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, Alessandro is the subject who went (andò) to greet his father (il padre).
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro girò, con l'auto, a raccoglierla." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro turned around, with his car, to pick her up". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "The children played soccer all afternoon." is grammatically correct. Here are some reasons why: * "Children" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "played". In English, we use a plural form of the verb when the subject is plural. * "Soccer" is a singular noun that can refer to a game or sport. It is correctly used in this context as the object of the verb "played". * "All afternoon" is an adverbial phrase that tells us how long the action lasted. It modifies the verb "played" and provides more information about the duration of the activity. Overall, the sentence is well-constructed and easy to understand.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" refers to one person, so it takes the third singular form of the verb "obbedisce".
1	Correct	The sentence "I soldati hanno passato le armi ai prigionieri." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The soldiers handed over the weapons to the prisoners." Soldiers (soldati) is a plural noun that requires the use of "hanno" which agrees with it as a third-person plural verb form meaning "have". Therefore, no grammatical mistakes were found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro ama i bignè." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro loves cream puffs" in English. Here's why it's correct: - "Alessandro" is correctly conjugated as a singular masculine subject in the third person present tense ("ama"). - "i bignè" is the correct way to refer to multiple "bignè" or cream puffs since "bignè" is a masculine noun that takes a plural article "i".
1	Correct	The sentence "Il cedro ama la libertà." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The cedar tree loves freedom.", where "il cedro" refers to a male singular noun as subject, "ama" is the third person present tense of the verb "amare" meaning "to love", and "la libertà" is a female singular noun that serves as the direct object of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il giardiniere ha innaffiato il prato." is grammatically correct. It consists of two phrases - subject "il giardiniere" (the gardener) and predicate "ha innaffiato il prato" (has watered the lawn). Both nouns and verbs agree with each other in number and gender, so it's all good!
1	Correct	The sentence "A Lorenzo, Alessandro gli ha lasciato una ricca eredità." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "To Lorenzo, Alexander left a rich inheritance". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro beve il suo caffè." is grammatically correct. It means "Alessandro drinks his coffee" in Italian. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence, which is in the third person singular form, as indicated by the verb ending "-a" on "desidera". Similarly, "Beatrice" is the direct object of the sentence, so it appears in the accusative case with no change from its dictionary form. Overall, the syntax and morphology of this sentence adhere to standard Italian grammar rules.

1	Correct	The sentence "La zanzara pratica una rigida condotta morale." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The mosquito follows a strict moral conduct," which makes sense semantically as well. There are no morphological or syntactical errors in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "Il frigorifero ha una forte cotta per Francesco." is semantically incorrect because it implies that the refrigerator has a crush on Francesco, which doesn't make sense as appliances cannot have feelings or emotions. A more appropriate sentence could be: "Francesco ha una forte simpatia per il suo frigorifero.", meaning "Francesco has a strong liking for his refrigerator."
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso dette gli schiaffi a Maria." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso slapped her (Maria)". The verb "dette" agrees with the subject "Tommaso", since it is second person singular masculine ("tu" form). Also, the definite article "gli" correctly refers to the indirect object "schiaffi" which is a plural noun. Finally, the preposition "a" followed by "Maria" indicates that she was the recipient of the action performed by Tommaso.
1	Correct	The given sentence "Riccardo allungò uno schiaffo a Giulia." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate definite articles with the nouns. Additionally, the verb form used agrees with the singular masculine gender of the direct object "uno schiaffo" (a slap).
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo resta in silenzio." is grammatically correct. It consists of one independent clause where the subject "Riccardo" performs the action "restare" which means "to stay" and complies with Italian syntax rules for word order.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo non ha più sospetti su Emma." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo no longer has suspicions about Emma". Each word is correctly inflected for number, gender, and tense. There is an appropriate agreement between words in terms of grammatical function. Therefore, it does not have any morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo riceve aiuto da Edoardo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo receives help from Edoardo," where both names are correctly used as singular nouns.
0	Syntax	In Italian, the verb must agree in number with its subject. Here, the subject "Alessandro" is singular while the verb "agitano" is plural. It should be "agita" instead. Also, there shouldn't be an accent on the last letter of "agita". So the corrected form would be: "Alessandro agita Beatrice."
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo fa friggere l'uovo nella padella." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo makes the egg fry in the pan". The subject Edoardo is doing an action ("fa friggere") on the direct object "l'uovo" using the tool "nella padella". All verbs agree with their respective subjects in number and gender. In this case, the verb "fa" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Edoardo", so it is correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo proceeds with loading the truck with boxes." is grammatically correct in English. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present that would make it unacceptable as a standalone sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "The red ink is the fountain pen's charge" is semantically incorrect because it suggests that the ink itself possesses the property of being a charge for a fountain pen, which does not make logical sense. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "The fountain pen's charge is red ink." In this revised version, the relationship between the charge and the ink is clearer - the charge consists of red ink rather than the ink being the charge itself.
1	Correct	The sentence "La stilografica è caricata." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The fountain pen is loaded.", where "la stilografica" is the subject, "è" is the third-person singular form of the verb "essere", which means "to be", and "caricata" is the past participle of the verb "caricare", which means "to load". Therefore, the whole phrase can be translated as "The fountain pen is loaded.", with no grammatical mistakes found in it.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso fruga nei cassetti della scrivania di Giulia." is grammatically correct. It means "Tommaso rummages through the drawers of Juliet's desk" in English. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make it ungrammatical.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using an object pronoun such as "l'" which means "it" in English, it needs to come before the verb. Therefore, the correct form would be "Andrea lo carica." meaning "Andrea loads it". Additionally, "un orologio" would have been more appropriate than just "orologio", since we do not know what exactly Andrea is loading without the definite article "un".
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo dà molte botte al cane." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo gives many blows to the dog.", where "dà" is the third person singular form of the verb dare ("to give") that agrees with the subject "Riccardo".
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo sale, per una seconda volta, le scale di corsa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo runs up the stairs again". All the words are used correctly and agree with each other in terms of number and gender, the verb form matches the subject, and the sentence structure follows standard rules for word order.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice ha l'incarico di rapire Emma." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice has the charge to abduct Emma." Each word is correctly inflected for number and gender, and it follows the standard SVO structure of an indicative present tense sentence with a direct object complement.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the third person singular verb form "corre" (runs), it must agree with its subject in number and gender. Here, the subject is "Alessandro" which is masculine and singular, so the verb conjugation is correct. However, "l'asina" means "the she-donkey", but asinas cannot run. Therefore, you need either an animal that can run or change the verb according to what the donkey is doing. For instance, the proper way would be "Alessandro cavalca l'asina." ("Alessandro rides the she-donkey.")
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is the subject of the sentence, which takes the third person singular verb form "prende". The direct object is "il cervo", which triggers the use of the reflexive pronoun "lo" before the past participle "at terra". Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il frigo ha sedotto un gatto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The refrigerator has seduced a cat.", where "frigo" is a colloquial term for refrigerator, "ha sedotto" is the third person singular form of the verb "sedurre" which means to seduce, and "un gatto" is a masculine singular noun that means a cat.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il libro sulla tavola è interessante" is grammatically correct. It means "The book on the table is interesting". Here we have a subject "il libro sulla tavola" that consists of an article "il", noun "libro" with its adjective "interessante", and preposition "sulla" which connects it with another noun "tavola". This structure respects Italian grammar rules for word order and agreement in gender and number between words.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ha sedotto una minorenne." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo has seduced an underage girl.", where "ha" is the auxiliary verb used for compound tenses with masculine singular subject, "sedotto" is the past participle form of the verb "sedurre", "una" is the feminine singular definite article, and "minorenne" is a noun meaning "underage person".
1	Correct	The sentence "Tutta la sala applaudì all'affermazione dell'oratore." is grammatically correct. It consists of a main clause "tutta la sala applaudì" where the subject "tutta la sala" agrees with the verb in number and tense ("applaudì" - third person singular past tense) and a subordinate clause "all'affermazione dell'oratore". Both clauses follow Italian grammar rules and do not contain any morphological, syntactic or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola ha letto un libro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola read a book.", where "ha" is an auxiliary verb used for past tense, "letto" is the past participle form of the verb "leggere", "un" is an article and "libro" means book.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using articles before a noun that starts with a vowel sound, you need to use an article that ends in -i or -e instead of -o or -a. Therefore, "un biglietto" becomes "un biglietto", but "il biglietto" does not change. However, in this case, it seems like the speaker wants to refer to multiple tickets, so the plural form "biglietti" would actually be more appropriate than "biglietto". So, the corrected sentence could be either "Maria colleziona un biglietto d'amore." or "Maria colleziona i biglietti d'amore." depending on what was intended.
0	Morphology	In English, verbs must agree with their subject in number, which means that singular subjects require third person singular verb forms ending in -(e)s or -(e)sh, while plural subjects take base form verbs without an -(e)s or -(e)sh ending. Here, the subject she is singular, but the verb don't is a nonstandard contraction used for negative statements where the subject is plural; it does not match the singular subject. A standard and acceptable alternative would use the appropriate third-person singular verb does, as in "She doesn't like spinach" (with the apostrophe indicating contraction).
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola fa una corsa in giardino." is grammatically correct since it follows standard Italian syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. Additionally, all words used in the sentence have their proper form according to their role within the phrase.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo scambia libri con Jane." is grammatically correct in Italian. It consists of a simple sentence with a subject ("Riccardo"), a verb ("scambia") and an indirect object ("Jane"). There is no grammatical error present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alice ha curvato la fronte" is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "ha" is an auxiliary verb used with "curvato" to form the compound past tense, while "la" refers to "fronte", which agrees with it in gender and number. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using a verb in its third person singular form "ha" (has) or "è" (is), it must agree with a single subject. However, you have used "Maria ha curvato", which would translate to "Maria has curved". Since Maria is female but "curvato" is masculine singular, the sentence is not grammatically correct. It should either be "Maria ha curvato la sua faccia." (Maria has curved her face.) or "Maria e Jane hanno curvato le loro facce." (Maria and Jane have curved their faces).
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia mantiene testa al nemico" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sophia keeps her head against the enemy". Each word is correctly inflected for number and gender, and they agree with each other according to standard Italian grammar rules.
0	Syntax	In Italian, reflexive verbs require a reflexive pronoun that matches the subject in number and gender. Here, "si" does not match the third person plural subject "Alessandro." It should be "Si gonfiano la testa."
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice planted on Assunta" is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactic or semantic mistakes that would make it unacceptable in Italian language.
1	Correct	The sentence "Capire le intenzioni segrete di una persona." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Understanding the secret intentions of a person." All words agree with each other in number and gender, and they follow the standard word order for questions in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria cambia le carte" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Mary changes the cards". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error that can be found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo fa a cattivo gioco." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo plays badly." or "Riccardo makes a bad game.", depending on context. There are no mistakes regarding morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea ha rotto il collo a Beatrice." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea broke Beatrice's neck.", where "ha rotto" is the third person singular form of the verb "rompere", which agrees with the subject "Andrea". "Il collo" is the masculine singular definite article followed by the noun "collo" meaning "neck", and it refers to the direct object of the sentence. Finally, "a Beatrice" indicates the indirect object, which denotes the recipient or beneficiary of the action. Overall, all elements of the sentence follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "La musica rock rompe le orecchie." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Rock music breaks (one's) ears," which can be interpreted as "Rock music is very loud" or "It damages one's hearing". Here's why it's grammatically correct: * "Musica" is feminine singular and agrees with its definite article "la". * "Rock" modifies "musica", describing what kind of music it refers to. * "Rompe" is the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "rompere" ("to break"), agreeing with the subject "musica". * "Le" is the plural indirect object pronoun that corresponds to the direct object "orecchie" in this context. * "Orecchie" is the plural form of "orecchio" meaning "ear(s)", which agrees with the plural indirect object pronoun "le".
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ha dato quel che e di Tommaso a Tommaso." is grammatically correct. Although it might seem that "che" refers to "what," in this context, it actually functions as a relative pronoun referring back to "quel" ("that"), which is used here as an adjective meaning "the aforementioned." Therefore, no correction needs to be made.
1	Correct	The sentence "La mosca salta al naso di Riccardo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The fly jumps on Riccardo's nose." Here's why it's correct: - "La mosca" is feminine singular and agrees with the article "la". It refers to a female fly or simply one fly regardless of gender. - "salta" is third person singular present tense conjugated from the verb "saltare", meaning "to jump". - "al naso" is a prepositional phrase that indicates direction, where "al" is short for "a il" ("on the"). - "di Riccardo" is another prepositional phrase indicating possession. In English we would say "Riccardo's", but in Italian you use "di" before names. So overall, all elements match up correctly both internally and externally!
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "andare" (to go) followed by the preposition "a", it requires an article or a pronoun before the noun that follows the preposition. So in this case, since "monte" means mountain, you would say either "Andiamo ad un monte" (We are going to a mountain) or "Andiamoci sopra" (Let's go up there). Therefore, the original sentence "Andare a monte" is not grammatically correct as it lacks an article or a pronoun.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing the verb "to be" in its appropriate form. It should be either "Sono all'indice" for first person plural or "Sono alla index" with the article "alla".
1	Correct	The sentence "Metterei al centro" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I would put in the center". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error that can be found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "alzare" which means "to raise," it requires an object to complete its meaning. For instance, one can say "Alza il braccio" which translates to "Raise your arm." Therefore, in this case, the sentence "Alzare il gomito" without any context or further information about what needs to be raised is considered syntactically incorrect as it lacks a clear subject or direct object.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject in Italian. In English, "One can lose one's mind" would translate to "Si può perdere la ragione" or "Può succedere di perdere la ragione."
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "to take away" (levare) with "from something" (dal fuoco - from the fire), we need an object pronoun between the verb and the preposition. Therefore, it should be "gliela" or "gliene" instead of just "la". So, a correct version would be: "Cavargliela dalle castagne dal fuoco." (To take the chestnuts out of the fire for someone.)
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "essere" (to be) with an adjective, both the subject and the adjective need to agree in number. Here, since the subject "i bambini" is plural, we should use the plural form of the adjective "poveri". Therefore, the correct version would be "Sono poveri i bambini."
1	Correct	The sentence "L'angelo custode accompagna la fantasia di ogni bambino." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: - "Angelo custode" means "guardian angel," which is grammatically singular and masculine. - "Accompagnare" means "to accompany," which agrees with its subject "l'angelo custode." - "La fantasia" means "the imagination/fantasy," which is feminine singular. It matches "di ogni bambino" that refers back to it as an indirect object. - "Di ogni bambino" translates to "of every child" indicating possession. This phrase modifies "la fantasia." So overall, the sentence follows proper grammar rules for morphology, syntax, and semantics in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence "I have been working as a software engineer for many years" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order in the present perfect tense with the auxiliary verb "have." The subject "I" matches correctly with its corresponding singular form of the verb "have," indicating that it is grammatically sound.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "essere" as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses with multiple subjects, you must agree the past participle with the subject's gender and number. Since both "Masha" and "Jane" are feminine singular nouns, the past participle "state" should also be in its feminine singular form, which is "stata". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Masha e Jane sono state alla festa con lo smoking."
0	Syntax	In Italian, verbs must agree in number with their subject. In this case, "la moto" is singular while "nuotano" is plural. Therefore, it should be "nuota" since la moto is feminine singular. Also, "di zecca" doesn't make sense here; maybe you meant "pulita" which means clean or new? A possible correction could be: "La moto di Leonardo è nuova."
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho visto una unità in marcia." is grammatically correct. It means "I saw a unit marching" or "I saw a vehicle/device in operation". Here's why it's right: - "ho visto": This part is in the first person singular (present tense) form of the verb vedere ("to see"). - "una unità": In this context, "un'unità" refers to a single item, object, or device. - "in marcia": This phrase indicates that something is moving or functioning properly.
0	Syntax	In Italian, verbs must agree in number with their subject. Here, "Leonardo" is singular while "ritorni" is also singular. However, since "Leonardo" is the subject of the sentence, it requires a third person singular verb form for past tense which would be "è tornato". Therefore, the corrected sentence will be "Che Leonardo sia tornato piace a Maria."
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia corre a mangiare" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure for expressing an action being performed ("corre," meaning runs) by the subject ("Sofia") with the intent or purpose of doing something else ("mangiare," meaning eats).
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea sorride a Sofia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea smiles at Sofia.", where both names are correctly used as direct objects of the verb "sorridere" (to smile).
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice bada a che l'articolo sia chiaro" is grammatically correct. It means "Beatrice makes sure that the article is clear." Each word in the sentence follows the correct grammatical rules for Italian, including verb conjugation, noun-adjective agreement, and use of subjunctive mood. Therefore, it does not contain any morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro divorzia da Paola." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro is getting divorced from Paola.", where both names are in their singular form as expected since they refer to only one person each.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo abita in una casa piccola" is grammatically correct. It means "[He] lives in a small house". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "non" for negation, it must come before the verb. Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "Maria non sta a Roma." Instead, you wrote "Maria sta non a Roma," which is syntactically incorrect in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence "Mille stelle brillano nel cielo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A thousand stars are twinkling in the sky." Each word follows proper grammar rules for morphology, syntax, and semantics.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "ciò" as a pronoun referring back to an object or idea, it needs to agree in gender and number with that noun. Here, "questa cosa" is feminine singular, so "ciò" should also be feminine singular ("ciò che"). Therefore, the grammatically correct form would be "Ciò che guarda queste cosa." However, since "cose" should be used instead of "queste cosa", the corrected version becomes "Ciò che guardano."
1	Correct	The sentence "Tutti i giorni, Leonardo intensely studies them for three hours a day" is grammatically correct in English. It means that every day, Leonardo spends three hours studying something intensively. In Italian, the sentence seems fine as well - it translates to "Every day, Leonardo studies them intensively for three hours a day." However, without context or knowing what "them" refers to, I cannot provide a more detailed analysis of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "La parete è toccata dalle spalle di Riccardo." is grammatically correct. It means "The wall was touched by Riccardo's shoulders" in English. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo tocca la schiena di Paola" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo touches Paola's back". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error in this sentence.
0	Syntax	This sentence is incomplete and lacks a main verb, making it syntactically incorrect. In order for the sentence to be grammatically complete, a suitable verb must be added.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele mangia poca frutta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele eats little fruit.", where "mangia" is the third person singular form of the verb "mangiare", which agrees with the subject "Gabriele".
0	Syntax	In English, verbs generally agree in number with their subject, so for third person singular present tense, we add an -s or -es to the base form of the verb. However, in Italian, as in many other languages, verbs must also agree with their subject in gender and number. Therefore, "Andrea beve" should actually be "Andrea beve**ono**," since "Andrea" is a third-person singular masculine noun.
0	Morphology	In Italian, the verb "pizzicare" requires an object in the third person singular or plural form ("lo", "la", "lo/l'", "li", "le"). The phrase "con sadismo" suggests that "sadismo" is the intended direct object here, but it does not have any article or determiner before it. A possible correction could be "Francesco pizzica il sadismo." However, without additional context it's unclear what exactly the subject would be picking at, so this might still not make sense semantically.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject, which is correctly in the singular form and matches with the third person present tense verb conjugation "-a" for verbs ending in "e". In this case, "disegna" means "draws/is drawing", so the whole sentence translates as "Alessandro draws on the wall."
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo balla la rumba" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo dances the rumba". Lorenzo is the subject and balla (dance) is the verb in third person singular present tense which agrees with the subject Lorenzo. La rumba is the direct object of the sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence "La siesta sono due" is grammatically incorrect because "siesta" is singular in Italian, so it cannot take a plural verb form such as "sono". A more appropriate way to express that someone takes two naps would be "Faccio due sieste." or "Prendo due pause per riposarmi.", both meaning "I take two naps."
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco nuota a rana" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco swims using breaststroke". Each word is correctly inflected for number, gender, and tense where appropriate.
1	Correct	The sentence "La spugna pulisce." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The sponge cleans" in English. Here, "la spugna" is a singular feminine noun that requires an article "la". And "pulisce" is a third-person singular verb which agrees with the subject "la spugna". Therefore, no grammatical error found in this sentence.
0	Morphology	In Italian, "the" is translated as "il" for masculine singular nouns or "lo" before a vowel, but here it is used as "il" before a consonant sound "te". However, in reality, "the" would translate to "i" since "amaro" is a masculine plural noun that starts with a vowel sound. So, the corrected version will be: "Tutti bevono i teatrini." which means "They all drink the little theaters." This might not make sense in English, so perhaps you meant something else?
1	Correct	The sentence "I lavori fatti hanno reso più larga la piazza." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "The completed works have made the square larger" in English. Here is why it is correct: * "Lavori" is the plural form of "lavoro," which means "work". In this case, "lavori fatti" refers to the works that have been done or completed. * "Hanno reso" is the third-person plural conjugation of the verb "rendere", meaning "to make" or "to render". It agrees with the subject "lavori fatti" since both are plural. * "Più larga" is an adjective phrase modifying "piazza". It literally translates to "larger" but functions more like a predicate adjective here. * "La piazza" is a singular feminine noun referring to the square being referred to. Since "più larga" describes it, they must agree in gender and number, hence "la piazza".
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso afferra il gatto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[Tommaso] grasps the cat.", where "grasps" is translated as "afferra". In this case, the subject "Tommaso" is singular and the direct object "il gatto" uses the masculine singular definite article "il", so the verb "afferra" is conjugated correctly for its subject "Tommaso".
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro riflette sul gatto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro reflects on the cat.", where "riflette" is the third person singular conjugation of the verb "riflettere", indicating that the subject of the sentence, "Alessandro", is performing the action of reflecting. "Sul" is a preposition meaning "on", introducing the object of reflection, which is "gatto". Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea discute la validità delle affermazioni di Maria" is grammatically correct. It means "Andrea discusses the validity of Maria's claims". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo fotografa Alice." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the SVO structure with subject ("Riccardo"), verb ("fotografa") and object ("Alice").
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso legge il giornale in salotto." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar. Here, "Tommaso" is the subject who is reading "il giornale" which means "the newspaper", and he is doing it "in salotto" meaning "in the living room".
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele ha visto una casa di mattoni rossi." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar in terms of morphology, syntax, and semantics. Here, we have one subject, Gabriele, who performed an action, saw, which is denoted by the auxiliary verb "ha" in the compound past tense form. Additionally, the direct object is introduced with the definite article "una," indicating that it refers to something specific but not yet identified. Therefore, no corrections need to be made.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso ha visto una casa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "[Tommaso] has seen [a house]". Here, "ha" is an auxiliary verb used with "visto", which agrees with the singular masculine subject "Tommaso". Also, "una casa" indicates that it refers to one house as well. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be found within this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "I libri vecchi stanno nella cassa." is grammatically correct. It means "The old books are in the box" in English. All words agree with each other in number, gender, and tense, as required by Italian grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Un libro passa da Beatrice a Francesco." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A book passes from Beatrice to Francesco.", where "libro" is the subject, "passa" is the verb in third person singular form that agrees with the subject, and "da Beatrice a Francesco" indicates the movement or change of possession of the book between two people.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using the verb "essere" (to be) with multiple subjects, you need to use the third person plural form "sono". Therefore, the sentence "Non c'è sempre una concordanza in Maria tra i fatti e le parole." is syntactically incorrect since it uses the singular form "c'è" instead of the required plural form "ci sono". A corrected version would be: "Non ci sono sempre una concordanza in Maria tra i fatti e le parole.", but note that this still doesn't make much sense semantically as we don't expect someone named Maria to have an agreement between facts and words within herself; perhaps some context or further rephrasing might help clarify its intended meaning.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject who performs the action "mettere" which means "to put". She puts "il libro", meaning "the book", into "la borsa", meaning "the bag". All words agree with each other in gender, number and tense as required by Italian grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo stacca la foto dall'album." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo tears the photo from the album". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Emma ha ritrovato l'anello nel cassetto." is grammatically correct. It follows proper Italian syntax rules with the subject-verb agreement between "Emma" and "ha," as well as the use of singular nouns and articles ("l'anello" - the ring). Additionally, it conveys a clear meaning that Emma found the ring in the drawer.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il meccanismo di funzionamento del rotore alloggia se stesso in quell'involucro." is grammatically correct. It follows proper Italian syntax rules and does not contain any semantic or morphological errors. Therefore, it can be considered an acceptable sentence in standard Italian.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "That box stores the photos of Alessandro and Edoardo." Each part of the sentence follows the rules of Italian grammar. The subject "Quella scatola" agrees with the verb "conserva," which is also in singular form. Additionally, the preposition "di" followed by two masculine names shows possession correctly. Therefore, overall it is a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "E ciò è avvenuto al bar." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated as "And that happened at the bar" or "That's what happened at the bar". There are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors found in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola ha estratto la pistola e ciò ha avuto luogo dalla borsa." is grammatically correct. It means "Paola pulled out the gun and that happened from her bag". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic mistakes in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il libro non sta nella cartella." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The book does not fit into the folder" or more literally "The book isn't on the folder". Here's why it's correct: - "libro" is singular masculine noun meaning "book"; - "non" is an adverb that negates the verb; - "sta" is the third person singular present tense of the verb "stare", which can mean "to stay" as well as "to fit" here; - "nella" is the contraction of "in + la" indicating "into the" since we use "in" with "cartella" when referring to its inside part; - "cartella" is feminine singular noun meaning "folder".
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The saleswoman wraps gift paper around the bottle." Each word follows standard conjugations for its respective tense and matches with other words based on gender, number, etc. Therefore, it does not contain any morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It was from the sidewalk to the door of her house that Beatrice planted stakes." The subject "Beatrice" matches with the verb form "ha piantato". Also, all endings on words agree with gender and number as required by grammar rules.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "al" before a noun that starts with a vowel or a silent h, we need to use the article "l'" instead of "il". Therefore, the correct form would be "Maria dà sepoltura al padre sotto un albero".
1	Correct	The sentence "La polizia sgombera la piazza dei dimostranti." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "The police clear the square of protesters" in English. Here, "la polizia" means "the police", "sgombera" is third person singular form of verb "sgombra" which means "clear out or evacuate". "La piazza" refers to "square" and "dei dimostranti" is genitive plural form meaning "of protesters". So all words used in the sentence are correctly conjugated based on their role in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "L'architetto ha decorato la facciata di fregi in marmo." is grammatically correct. It means "The architect decorated the façade with marble friezes". The subject "l'architetto" agrees with the verb "ha decorato", and the meaning is clear without any semantic ambiguity.
0	Syntax	In Italian, adverbs usually come before verbs, but in this case, "sol" comes after "uccise," which makes it syntactically incorrect. Additionally, "colpo" requires an article, so the corrected sentence would be: "Andrea uccise Eduardo con un solo colpo di coltello."
0	Syntax	In Italian, adjectives need to agree in number with the noun they modify. In this case, "bagagli" is plural but "non stanno" indicates that it would be singular, which creates a syntax error. It should be "I bagagli non stanno nella macchina."
1	Correct	The sentence "I libri stanno nella stanza." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The books are in the room." Here, "libri" which refers to multiple books is correctly conjugated with the third person plural form of the verb "stare", which is "stanno". Additionally, the preposition "nella" agrees with "stanza" as it requires an article before it when used with feminine singular nouns. Therefore, no grammatical mistakes can be found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "I vestiti vecchi stanno nell'armario" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The old clothes are in the closet." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "non" with a verb that uses "stare", such as "stanno" in this case, it needs to agree with its subject both in number and person. Therefore, the sentence "I vestiti vecchi non stanno nell'armario." should actually be "I vestiti vecchi non stanno negli armadi.", which means "The old clothes do not stay in the wardrobe(s).".
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea profuma la stanza di aromi di pino" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea scents the room with pine fragrances." Each word is correctly conjugated or spelled according to its role in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Cicche intasano lo scarico della fontana." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Clogs clog the drain of the fountain" in English. All words are correctly inflected for number and gender, and they agree with each other syntactically.
0	Syntax	In Italian, when using "con" twice in one phrase, you have to use gerunds after both instances of "con". A gerund in Italian is formed by adding "-ndo" or "-endo" at the end of the verb conjugated in its infinitive form. Therefore, the correct version of the sentence would be: "Maria sta facendo l'innaffiatura delle piante con acqua condisinfestante."
1	Correct	The sentence "Il radar ha localizzato l'aereo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The radar detected the airplane." In this sentence, "il radar" is the subject, which is singular masculine; hence, we use "ha" for third-person singular verb conjugation.
