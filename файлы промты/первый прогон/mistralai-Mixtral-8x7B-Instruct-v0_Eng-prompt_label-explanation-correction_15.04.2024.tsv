0	The verb "voglio" requires an infinitive verb after it, so there should be "di" between "voglio" and "salutare". Also, in Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, except for some cases such as when expressing possession. Therefore, "Giulia" should come before "bella".	The sentence should be: "Voglio salutare Giulia." or "I want to greet Julia.", if translated into English.
1	The sentence "Ho voglia di salutare Sofia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "I feel like greeting Sophia" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The possessive determiner "my" must agree in number with its noun. In this case, "lo" is singular and masculine, so the correct form of the possessive determiners would be "mio".	Il mio preferito è la Divina Commedia.
0	The phrase "il mio treno preferito" means "my favorite train", but it seems you want to express that Dante Alighieri's famous work "La Divina Commedia" ("The Divine Comedy") is your preferred train. However, in Italian, we don't say "the X train". Instead, you can use "Il mio treno preferito è quello della Divina Commedia." This translates as "My favorite train is the one from The Divine Comedy," which still doesn't make much sense since trains and literary works don't match up directly; I assume you meant something else? If so, please rephrase accordingly.	My suggested correction for what I think you intend: "Mi piace molto la Divina Commedia di Dante" - meaning "I really like Dante's Divine Comedy."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha detto che Andrea ha parlato con Riccardo." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It uses the right tenses, word order, and punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea is preparing the answer" is grammatically correct in English as it follows subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ha incontrato Giulia." is grammatically correct because it follows the Subject-Verb-Object structure and uses proper Italian grammar rules for verb conjugations based on the subject and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "È ricomparso il padre del ragazzo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The boy's father has reappeared."	The sentence is already correct. No correction needed.
1	The sentence "I prezzi sono aumentati" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the rules for word order and verb conjugation. It translates to "Prices have risen" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The first person singular past tense of "salvare" is "salvai", not "salvato". Also, there should be a comma after the name "Andrea".	Salvai Andrea, ci siammo dati alla pazza gioia.
1	The sentence "Il palazzo delle assicurazioni è crollato." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar in terms of word order, verb conjugation, subject-verb agreement, and article usage.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Quella costruzione" requires a singular verb form, but "offendono" is plural.	La costruzione offende il buon gusto.
1	The subject "Newton" is singular, so the verb must also be in the third person singular form "ha spiegato". This is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Mi han dato il premio" follows the standard rules for verb conjugation in Italian. In particular, the present perfect tense of the verb "dare" when used with the pronoun "mi" is correctly expressed as "mi han dato".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso si è danneggiato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso has hurt himself."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Quegli uomini hanno denunciato se stessi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Those men reported themselves".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Compro e leggo quel libro" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order and all words are correctly conjugated for tense and number.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ho" should agree with its subject in number and person, so it should be "ho" for first person singular but here it refers to "Lorenzo", which is third person singular. Therefore, the correct form should be "ha".	Ho incontrato Lorenzo, non ha incontrato Emma.
0	The verb "do" should agree in number with its subject, so it should be "does" instead of "don't". Also, the third person singular present tense form of "like" is "likes", not just "like". So, the correct version would be "She doesn't like him."	She doesn't like him.
1	The sentence "Ho incontrato molti amici di Riccardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. It uses the correct verb form for "I have met" which is "ho incontrato", and correctly indicates possession with the preposition "di". Additionally, there are no spelling errors or missing words.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ho" does not agree with the subject "Non". In Italian, when using negation, the verb must change depending on the tense and the subject. A double negative ("non ho") is always wrong.	I have not found your book in that library. Or in Italian: "Io non ho trovato il tuo libro in quella biblioteca."
1	The sentence "Non ce ne ho trovati molti" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure for negations and object pronouns in Italian. In English, the sentence would translate to "I haven't found many of them."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha promesso a Maria che metterà in vendita la propria casa." is grammatically correct because all words are spelled correctly, there is a clear subject-verb agreement, and the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria has greeted her parents" is grammatically correct in English. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper tense for past action with third person singular subject.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non è molto intelligente" follows the standard structure for forming negative sentences in Italian. It uses the negation particle "non" before the auxiliary verb "è", which agrees with the subject in number and gender ("è" being third person singular masculine here). Then it employs an adverb ("molto") to modify the following adjective ("intelligente"). All words follow proper grammar rules and agree with each other regarding tense, mood, voice, and aspect.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the rules of grammar and punctuation in English language. "Riccardo" as a name starts with a capital letter; there is a comma after "molto", which separates an introductory adverbial clause from the main clause; the word "credo" means "I believe" in Italian but here it functions as an interjection expressing uncertainty about someone being intelligent, so it doesn't affect the grammaticality of the whole sentence in English context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Hanno chiamato molte persone quel numero" is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It uses the appropriate verb tense, word order, and agreement between subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Che cosa ha comprato Riccardo?" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure for asking questions about what someone has bought using the present perfect tense. In English, this would translate to "What did Riccardo buy?" but in Italian, you use the present perfect tense when referring to past actions with an impact on the current time.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea été été incontré par Leonardo" is grammatically incorrect because it uses two être verbs ("étété") consecutively which is not possible in French grammar. Also, "par" should be used instead of "da".	The sentence is already correct when written as "Andrea a été rencontré par Léonard."
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha domandato da chi non era stato visto Leonardo." follows the rules of Italian grammar and is acceptable in formal writing.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo, mi han detto che parlera domani." is grammatically correct in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "han" is used as plural form for third person singular pronouns such as "mi" which means "me". Also, it uses proper spelling for verbs based on context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele, when did you see him?" is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses proper tense ("did see"), and includes appropriate punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "In quali casseetti Leoardo ha messo i fogli?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "In which drawer did Leonardo put the papers?"	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in the sentence. It should be "Quali políticos han hablado?" (which politicians have spoken?) instead of "Quale politico hanno parlato?" because "políticos" is plural, so the verb must also be in its plural form ("han hablado").	Quali políticos han hablado?
0	The sentence contains too many embedded questions and it is unclear who is speaking. It can be simplified for better understanding.	The sentence is not clear without further context. A possible correction could be: "Si è annunciato in radio che il giudice ha fatto una dichiarazione."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha detto che partirà domani." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo said he will leave tomorrow".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Quando è arrivato Francesco, abbiamo potuto cenare." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct with no spelling errors or misplaced words. It follows standard Italian syntax rules for word order and uses appropriate verb forms based on the subject-verb agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. It should be "Chi **tocca** i fili, muore." instead of "Chi toccano i fili muore." as the singular subject "chi" does not agree with the plural verb form "toccano".	Chi tocca i fili, muore.
1	The sentence "Alessandro, who came to visit me yesterday, told me to greet you." is grammatically correct in English. It contains a dependent clause ("who came to visit me yesterday") that describes the subject of the independent clause ("Alessandro"). Both clauses contain a clear subject-verb agreement and proper use of tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct with no spelling errors or awkward phrasing. It follows standard Italian syntax rules and uses appropriate verb forms and tenses.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il timore della guerra è ingiustificato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The fear of war is unjustified."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha perduto le chiavi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for forming a simple past tense sentence in Italian. It consists of the subject ("Riccardo"), the auxiliary verb "ha" which agrees with the subject, and the past participle form of the main verb "perdere", which is "perso". Additionally, the definite article "le" correctly precedes the plural noun "chiavi."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro è bramoso di potere" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro is eager for power".	The sentence is already correct. (Note: I am an AI language model and do not have personal experiences or opinions. My purpose is to provide accurate information and assist with tasks.)
1	The sentence "Penso che Francesco domandi l'ora a Lorenzo" is grammatically correct in Italian. In English it means "I think that Francesco asks Lorenzo for the time."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha affermato che Edoardo parla." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of two clauses joined by the conjunction "che". In the first clause, "Tommaso" is the subject, followed by the auxiliary verb "ha" in the compound past tense, which agrees with the masculine singular subject, and the main verb "affermare", which means "to assert". In the second clause, "Edoardo" is the subject, followed by the present tense third person singular form of the verb "parlare", which means "to speak". Both subjects and verbs agree in number and gender.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Avendo io sempre sostenuto una posizione diversa, dovrò votare contro questa proposta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Having always maintained a different position, I will have to vote against this proposal."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha ordinato ad Andrea di difendero." is grammatically correct with one exception. Instead of "difendero", it should have been "difenderlo" which is the correct form for the indirect object pronoun "lo". This change will make the verb agree in number and gender with its direct object.	The sentence is almost correct; you need to replace "difendero" with "difenderlo": Tommaso ha ordinato ad Andrea di difend**erlo**.
0	The verb "essere" should agree in number with its subject, so it should be "sono stati" instead of "è stati". Also, there shouldn't be a space before the punctuation mark at the end of the sentence.	Il fatto di essere stati scoperti un delitto ci ha sconvolti.
1	The sentence "Chi pensi che Alessandro incontrerà?" is grammatically correct. It is asking who do you think that Alessandro will meet.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La sedia su cui ti sei seduto è rotta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The chair you sat on is broken".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are spelled correctly and they agree in number and gender. Also, the verb "ha parlato" agrees with its subject "Tommaso." Moreover, the subordinate clause "che Tommaso ha parlato" starts with the conjunction "che," which introduces it properly. Finally, the punctuation marks are used appropriately throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "crede" requires the subjunctive mood after "che", so it should be "abbia" instead of "ha". Also, there shouldn't be a space before the punctuation mark.	Edoardo crede che Sofia abbia baciato.
0	The verb "sai" agrees with the singular subject "tu," but the plural form "potremo" follows it. It should be "sai come possiamo risolvere?"	Che problema non sai come possiamo risolvere? (Note: I am assuming you meant "che" as in "what problem" rather than "you" which would require different grammar.)
0	In English grammar, we use "does" with he/she/it in present simple tense for third person singular subjects in affirmative sentences, while we use "don't" with I/you/we/they. Therefore, the sentence "She don't likes me" is grammatically incorrect because it uses "don't" with she. The correct form would be "She doesn't like me".	She doesn't like me.
1	The sentence "Abbiamo visto lo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "We have seen him" or "We have seen it," depending on context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sofia says that Alessandro will speak tomorrow" is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains some inconsistencies in verb conjugations and pronoun usage. "se stessa" should be replaced with " sé", "ha mi" should be changed to "mi ha", and "aveva" should replace "ha". Additionally, there is no need for both "che" and "con." A corrected version could read as follows:	Beatrice declared that she had nothing to do with Gabriele.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha detto che Andrea si è guardato" is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all the rules of standard Italian grammar and spelling. The subject-verb agreement is correct, as well as the use of past tense ("ho parlato"). All words are correctly conjugated, inflected, and punctuated.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is structurally complex due to multiple subordinate clauses, but it appears to follow Italian grammar rules correctly in terms of verb conjugations and word order within each clause.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is structurally complex but grammatically correct with multiple embedded clauses. It expresses that Edoardo believes that Emma wants that Tommaso sees Gabriele.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il coniglio mangia." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all words agree with each other in number and gender. In this case, "il" is a masculine singular definite article, "coniglio" means rabbit and is also masculine singular, and "mangia" is the third person singular present tense form of the verb "mangiare," which means to eat. Therefore, the translation is "The rabbit eats."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word order in the question is incorrect. It should be "Che libro **ha** detto il professore che dobbiamo leggere?" Instead of "Che libro dice che il professore ha raccomandato di leggere?"	Che libro ha detto il professore che dobbiamo leggere?
0	The word "Per" in Italian can mean "by" but it needs to be followed by the preposition "di". Also, "me" should come after the verb. A correct version could be "Sono arrivato per primo, non tu."	Sono arrivato per primo, non tu. (Note: I am assuming the intended meaning of the original sentence is "I arrived first, not you.")
1	The sentence "Arriva un uomo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A man arrives" or "Here comes a man".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo killed Andrea" is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses regular past tense verb conjugation for the subject "Leonardo."	The sentence is already correct. No changes needed.
0	The verb "ha" should agree in number with its subject "Andrea", so it should be "ha detto". Also, "che" should be used instead of "que" which is Portuguese.	Andrea ha detto che Tommaso lo guarda. (Andrea said that Tommaso looks at him.)
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha voglia di andare al mare." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the proper subject-verb agreement and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "È questo libro che non avevo mai letto" contains both Italian and English words which can make it confusing but if we consider each word as being in its own language, then all grammar rules for both languages are followed correctly.	The sentence is already correct. Note: I am assuming you intended to ask about the mixed-language sentence provided above since there were no other sentences mentioned. If my assumption is wrong, please clarify so I could provide an accurate response based on proper context.
0	The verb "è" should agree in number with its subject, so it should be "sono". Also, there should be a question mark at the end since the sentence is a question.	Da quel professore, Tommaso non sono stato ancora interrogato? However, I would suggest changing the sentence to make it clearer who hasn't questioned Tommaso yet. For instance: "Da quale dei professori Tommaso non è stato ancora interrogato?"
1	The sentence "Alessandro crede che invaderemo quel paese" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In particular, the subject-verb agreement is respected, since "Alessandro" is singular and masculine, and "crede" agrees with it in number and gender; moreover, the verb tense used ("credere") matches the subjunctive mood required by the conjunction "che". Finally, there is no spelling mistake in the words composing the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules and there do not seem to be any spelling errors or misplaced words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the standard Italian grammar rules for verb conjugations in compound past tense ("passato prossimo") and word order. It uses the auxiliary verb "avere ("ha" - third person singular form of "avere", meaning "to have") with the past participle written ("finito"). Also, it correctly employs the negation particle "non".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is written in past tense ('scrisse') and present perfect tense ('ha finito'), which is used correctly to indicate an action completed in the past but with relevance to the present. Also, the use of direct object pronoun 'lo' before the verb 'finire' agrees in gender and number with its antecedent 'un libro', which is masculine singular.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Gabriele è scapolo ed è sposato." contains a contradiction because it says that Gabriele is both single ('scapolo') and married ('sposato'). It cannot be true for one person at the same time.	The sentence cannot be corrected as it includes factually inconsistent information.
1	The subject "l'attuale re di Francia" agrees in number with the verb "è", so the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Qualche studente ha superato l'esame" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Some student passed the exam".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a logical error. If some students have not passed the exam, it does not mean that every student has not passed the exam. It could be possible that only some students did not pass while others did.	If some students haven't passed the exam, then not every student has passed the exam.
1	The sentence "I promised Lorenzo to leave yesterday" is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses appropriate tense ("promised"), and includes a prepositional phrase ("to leave yesterday") with proper preposition usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Nel processo di primo grado, la corte dichiarò l'imputato innocente." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "In the first-degree trial, the court declared the defendant innocent."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Continua così e combinerai guai." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the proper subject-verb agreement and word order. It translates to "Keep it up and you will get into trouble" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ho preso le chiavi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I took the keys".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It contains direct speech ("ha detto") within indirect speech ("trasmettendoci"). All elements seem to agree with each other in terms of tense and person.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Una bella casa fa comodo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A beautiful house is comfortable."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Prendiamo questo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Let's take this".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject "I" in English corresponds to "Io" in Italian, while "Uso" means "use". So, it should be "Io uso il gladio." for grammatical correctness.	Io using the sword.
1	The sentence "Il calcolatore funziona bene." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the proper subject-verb-object order and uses appropriate endings for each word based on gender and number agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" should agree with the subject in number, so it should be "does" instead of "don't". Also, the contraction "she's" can be used for more concise expression.	She doesn't like apples. Or alternatively, she's not fond of apples.
0	The problem with the sentence is that it is missing the final vowel in the adjective "bella". In its singular feminine form, "bell" should be "bella".	Lei è bella.
1	The sentence "Il libro che mi ha prestato Lorenzo non mi piace." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I don't like the book that Lorenzo lent me".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct with consistent tense usage throughout. It can be understood as "They say you have told me that we never see each other."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "rapidally" in the sentence is incorrect. It seems that you intended to say "she read rapidly," which would mean she reads quickly. However, "rapidally" does not exist as an adverb in English; therefore, it makes the whole sentence ungrammatical. Instead, use "rapidly" as an adverb to modify the verb "read".	She read rapidly.
1	The sentence "Andando a casa, ho incontrato tuo fratello." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It uses proper verb conjugations for both "andare" (to go) and "incontrare" (to meet), as well as using appropriate singular masculine definite article "tuo" before noun "fratello".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sto andando a prendere la macchina." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the rules for word order, verb conjugation, and article usage. It means "I am going to pick up the car" in English translation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows proper grammatical rules for word order, subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and punctuation in standard English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "va'" needs to agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, the subject "you" is second person singular, so the verb should also be in second person singular form "vai".	Vai a casa!
1	The sentence "Io sono affamato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I am hungry".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Bravo, questo ragazzo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It is a common way to praise a boy in Italian.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola è una donna che apprezziamo molto." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The third person singular form of verbs in present simple tense requires an "-s" or "-es" at the end when the subject is he, she, or it. However, the verb "do" does not follow this rule; its base form is used with negative contractions such as "doesn't". In this case, "like" should be used instead of "likes", because we use the base form after doesn't/doesn't have.	She doesn't like to eat vegetables.
1	The sentence "Ho visto il libro che mi hai regalato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I saw the book you gave me".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gli amici il cui maestro è Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows proper Italian syntax rules. It can be translated as "The friends whose teacher is Andrea."	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English grammar, we use "doesn't" instead of "don't" with he/she/it in present simple tense for negative sentences. So, it should be "She doesn't like apples."	She doesn't like apples.
1	The sentence "Siccome è caduto, si è fatto male." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Because he fell, he hurt himself."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Volevano distruggerla e l'hanno distrutta" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. It also uses past tense verbs correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ognuno prenda il suo cappotto" follows the grammatical rules of Italian language. It uses the imperative form "prenda" which corresponds to third person singular in English, meaning "let each one take his/her own coat". Also it uses the determiner "suo" which matches with gender and number agreement for singular masculine as "cappotto".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Prendimi quell'aggeggio" follows the standard rules for word order in Italian and correctly uses the singular masculine definite article "quell'" before a singular masculine noun starting with a vowel ("aggeggio"). Additionally, it employs the imperative form "prendimi", which means "take me". Thus, the sentence can be interpreted as "Take that gadget."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ho dato al bambino il latte, ma lui non l'ha bevuto." is grammatically correct. It means "I gave the baby the milk, but he didn't drink it".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria uses the computer, I do not know how to do it." is grammatically correct in English because each word is spelled correctly, the verb tenses agree with their subjects, and the meaning is clear.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ho visto una casa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I saw a house" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ho visto tua madre" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I saw your mother."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La persona che mi ha parlato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The person who spoke to me" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Se uno va in treno, vuole stare comodo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. It uses the third person singular form of the verb "andare" which agrees with its subject "uno". Additionally, it correctly employs the subjunctive mood in the dependent clause "vuole stare comodo", indicating uncertainty about the action taking place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Fa male la mia testa" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugation for third person singular present tense ("fa") which means "it hurts." Also, "la mia testa" translates to "my head," which makes sense in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ho due case" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I have two houses."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ho" does not agree with its subject "delle case". It should be "Ho delle caseS."	La frase corretta dovrebbe essere: "Ho delle case**s**.", since the plural form of the noun requires a plural verb conjugation.
1	The sentence "Il cavallo è arrivato prima." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The horse arrived first".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I cavalli sono animali resistenti" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian grammar rules for word order and verb agreement. In this sentence, "cavalli," which means horses in English, is the subject, and "sono" agrees with it as a plural third-person verb meaning "are." Additionally, "animali" is the direct object of the sentence, and "resistenti" modifies it as an adjective. Overall, all words are used appropriately and follow proper syntax, making the sentence grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The verb "venuto" agrees in number and gender with the subject "qualcuno", so the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "He arrived." is grammatically correct in English as it follows subject-verb agreement rule where singular third person subjects require adding an -ed to the base form of verbs in present tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The third person singular form of verbs in present simple tense requires an -s at the end of the base verb for all subjects except for he, she, it. Therefore, "don't" should be replaced with "doesn't". Additionally, "likes" should agree with its subject "she", so we need the plural form "-es" rather than just "-s". Thus, the correct form would be "She doesn't like to eat vegetables."	She doesn't like to eat vegetables.
1	The sentence "Magari domani piove" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and verb conjugations for "piovere" match with the third person singular pronoun "domani."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" in negative form must be accompanied by "does" for third person singular subjects such as "she". Additionally, the base form of the verb should be used after "does", so it should be "like" instead of "likes".	She doesn't like to eat vegetables.
0	In present simple tense in English, we need to use base form of verb for third person singular subjects (she, he, it). So, the correct sentence is "She writes a letter to her aunt."	She writes a letter to her aunt.
0	The verb "do" should be used with negative statements and questions in English; it shouldn't be used with positive statements such as this one. Also, for third person singular subjects (she, he, it), we add an -s to the base form of verbs in present simple tense, so "likes" should be used instead of "like".	She doesn't like him.
1	The sentence "Alessandro promises Edoardo to stay at home" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a proper subject ("Alessandro"), verb ("promises"), indirect object ("Edoardo") and infinitive phrase acting as direct object ("to stay at home").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" should agree with the subject in number, so it should be "does" when the subject is third person singular ("she"). Also, the contraction "don't" is used for negations, but here there is no negation.	She doesn't have time.
1	The sentence "Ho riparato il tavolo" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure with proper tense agreement between the verb and its subject.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Quel ragazzo apre la porta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "That boy opens the door" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "to have heard" in English requires a past participle after it, which in this case would be "sung." So the correction for the Italian translation would be "Ho sentito i ragazzi cantare."	Ho sentito i ragazzi cantare.
0	The verb "vuole" does not agree with its subject "la macchina". It should be "vuole lavarsi" because a reflexive verb is required here.	La macchina vuole lavarsi.
1	The subject-verb agreement is correct in this sentence; "Il libro sono rosso" would be incorrect because "libro" is singular and requires a singular verb ("è"). In English, you might say "the book is red," never "*the books are red." It works the same way in Italian.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "venire" should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, it should be "viene" since the subject "Lei" is singular and feminine.	Lei viene fino a Napoli che non voglio.
1	The sentence "Quanto al bagno, mi fa piacere" follows all the rules of Italian grammar and is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is correctly written in terms of grammar and spelling. It is a question asking if someone knows Lorenzo.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English grammar, we use "doesn't" for third person singular subjects with present simple tense when expressing negations. So, it should be "she doesn't like", not "she don't likes".	She doesn't like apples.
1	The sentence "Credi che sia possible une cosa del genere?" contains only one typographical error where it says "une" instead of "una". Other than that, the grammar and spelling are correct in this Italian sentence.	The sentence is almost correct. It should say "Credi che sia possibile una cosa del genere?"
0	The sentence contains two main issues. Firstly, "che" after "lasciò" is unnecessary and changes the meaning of the sentence slightly. Secondly, there should be a comma before "e volevo".	Appena detto ciò, mi lasciò piangere e volevo dire molte cose.
1	The sentence "Sei sempre lo stesso: un amico fidato, paziente e onesto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "You are always the same: a loyal, patient, and honest friend."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il vento forte sul mare può provocare mareggiate." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A strong wind over the sea can cause storm surges".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "Piangere" is a verb in its infinitive form, which means it needs to be conjugated based on the subject and tense used in the sentence. In this case, you probably meant to use the tu form ("piangi") or the third person singular form ("piange").	Either "Tu piangi forte." (meaning "you cry hard" with second-person singular subject) or "Lui/Lei pianga forte." (meaning "he/she cries hard" with third-person singular subject).
0	The word "una" should agree with the gender of the noun it modifies, which is masculine ("gatto"). Therefore, it should be "un".	Ho preso in casa una specie di gatto. (incorrect because of the word "una") Ho preso in casa una specie di gatta.
1	The sentence "Ho preso dello zucchero" contains a minor error in the repetition of the article "del". In Italian, when using two nouns together with an article, you only need one article for both nouns. A corrected version would be "Ho preso dello zucchero."	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we use "does" for he/she/it in present simple tense when used with negations such as "not". So, it should be "She doesn't like wine.", where 'doesn't' is the contraction of 'does not'. Also, the verb after 'she' should be in base form which is 'like' instead of 'likes'.	She doesn't like wine.
1	The sentence "Quel che vendo è merce cinese." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper grammatical tense and agreement between the subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "mettere" needs an object in this context. A better way to express what I think you want to say would be "Mettere pressione." This means "to put pressure on" in English.	La frase corretta dovrebbe essere: "Mettere pressione".

1	The sentence "Mettitelo bene in capo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Put it on straight" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "nuova" cannot be used in this context because it contradicts with the previous word "vecchia", which means old. Instead, you could use "ancora utilizzabile" or something similar meaning still usable.	Questa macchina è vecchia ma ancora utilizzabile.
1	The sentence "Leonardo non conosce Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.

1	The sentence "Andrea ha trovato un biglietto per l'opera." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea found a ticket for the opera" which follows all the grammatical rules of the language.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "stare" must agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, the subject "Edoardo" is third-person singular masculine, so the verb form should also be third-person singular masculine, which would be "sta" instead of "stao".	Edoardo sta compilando.
0	The verb "emanare" needs to agree with its subject in number and gender. In this case, the subject "profumo" is singular and masculine, so the verb should be "emana" rather than "emanate". Additionally, there should be a word connecting the two phrases, such as a conjunction.	Il profumo emana.
1	The sentence "Aprire un nuovo negozio" in English means "To open a new store". It does not have a subject or an object which makes it incomplete as a standalone sentence but it can still be considered grammatically correct within context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Iniziare un'attività" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "to start a business."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La porta si è chiusa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for word order in Italian sentences.

The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele non ammette di essere preso in giro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of a proper subject ("Gabriele"), negation ("non"), verb form ("ammette"), infinitive verb form ("essere"), adverb ("preso") and preposition with article ("in giro").	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Che cosa ha preso?" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax rules for asking what someone has taken or ordered. It consists of a question word ("che cosa"), auxiliary verb ("ha") and past participle form of the verb ("preso").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Le scarpe si sono macchiate" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement in Italian. In this case, "le scarpe" is plural and feminine, so the verb "si sono macchiate" agrees with the subject by also being in the third person plural form ("sono").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Le giornate si sono accorciate" is grammatically correct but it uses an old form of the auxiliary verb "to be". Nowadays in modern Italian you would say "si **sono** accorciate", using the plural third person of the verb "essere" (to be) which agrees with the subject "le giornate" (the days). Using the singular form "si è" (si è accorciata) would imply a single day shortening itself, while the intended meaning here seems to refer to multiple days getting shorter as we approach winter solstice.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Qualcosa ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Something has shortened the days".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Qualcuno ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows proper subject-verb agreement and word order rules. It translates to "Someone has shortened the days".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Aggrapparsi a un ramo." seems incomplete as it lacks a main verb and proper context for understanding its meaning. It appears to be just an infinitive verb form "aggrapparsi" which needs to have a subject and auxiliary verb to make it a complete thought.	The correct sentence would depend on what you want to express with the words provided. Here is one possible completion: "È necessario aggrapparsi a un ramo per sopravvivere." (One must cling to a branch to survive.)
0	The verb "arenatesi" does not exist in Italian language. It seems that it could be formed from the noun "arena", but as a verb it doesn't make sense. Moreover, there is no subject-verb agreement between "arenatesi" and its plural subject "le navi". I believe the intended meaning is something similar to "Le navi si arenano, gli equipaggi scendono a terra." which means "The ships run aground, the crews go ashore."	Le navi si arenano, gli equipaggi scendono a terra.
1	The sentence "La nebbia è svanita" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement in Italian. In this case, "la nebbia" (the fog) is the subject and "è svanita" (has disappeared) is the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "si piangere" does not exist in Italian. It looks like there is some confusion with the reflexive pronoun "si". A possible correction could be "Alessandro si pente sempre" ("Alessandro always regrets").	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction would be "Alessandro si pente sempre".
1	The sentence "Riccardo si lagna sempre" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. In this sentence, "Riccardo" is the subject, and "si lagna" is the verb phrase, which means "complains." The adverb "sempre" modifies the verb phrase.	The sentence is already correct.

0	The verb "sbadigliare" needs to agree in number with its subject, so it should be "sbadigliano" since the subject "Andrea" is singular and masculine.	Andrea ha sbadigliato? should be changed to Andrea ha sbadigliato?.
1	The sentence "Riccardo pedala" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "pedala" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Riccardo".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The verb "approfittare" needs to agree with its subject in number and gender. In this case, the subject is "egli" which is third person masculine singular. Therefore, the past participle form used must end in "-ato", making it "ha approfittato". The sentence "È approfittato dell'esperienza." is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il figlio di Francesco si siede in prima fila alle 8 in punto." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar including subject-verb agreement, tense usage, word order, etc.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Quando iniziò il concerto, il figlio di Leonardo sedeva in prima fila." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ammuffisce" does not agree with its subject "il muro". In singular, masculine nouns like "muro", the third person present indicative form of verbs ending in "-ire" should end in "-e" rather than "-isc(e)". Therefore, it should be "Il muro ammuffisce" instead.	Il muro ammuffisce in una giornata.
1	The sentence "Paola sta suonando un pezzo di Bach" is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Lorenzo non ha cucinato" follows the standard structure for negation in Italian language. It consists of the subject ("Lorenzo"), the negation particle ("non") and the past participle form of the verb ("cucinato"). Therefore, it does not contain any grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La lettera scrive" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The letter writes," but it should be "La lettera viene scritta" for a more accurate translation since letters don't actively write by themselves. However, as far as grammar goes, there are no errors in "La lettera scrive."	La lettera scrive. (No correction needed.)
1	The word "Disturbo" can be used as a noun in Italian, meaning "disturbance" or "trouble". However, without additional context it is difficult to determine if its usage here is grammatically correct. Nevertheless, I will assume that the sentence is using it correctly based on the information provided.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo is filling out" is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb agreement rule in English where the third person singular present tense verb form ends with an -s or -es.

1	The sentence "Il macchinista si è fermato." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows all the necessary grammar rules for word order, verb conjugations, and subject-verb agreement. "Macchinista" means "train driver," "si" indicates reflexive action, "è" is the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere" which means "to be," and "fermato" is the past participle of the verb "fermare" meaning "to stop". Together they mean "The train driver stopped himself", although usually when referring to public transport you would say something more along the lines of "The train stopped." - "Il treno si è fermato." but the original sentence is still technically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "hanno" does not agree in number with its subject "il negoziante". It should be "ha" since "negoziante" is singular.	Il negoziante ha aumentato.
1	The subject-verb agreement is correct in this sentence. "Bicchieri" which means glasses is plural and the verb "si sono rotti" which means have broken is also in its plural form.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola ha acceso il fuoco." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order, with each element agreeing in number and tense. In this case, "Paola" (subject) is singular feminine, "ha acceso" (verb) is third person singular conjugated for present perfect tense, and "il fuoco" (object) is masculine singular noun.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "La lezione ha continuato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar.

The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Saltare un ostacolo" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure of a verb followed by an article and a noun. In this case, "saltare" means "to jump", "un" is the indefinite article "a/an" and "ostacolo" means "obstacle".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" in the third person singular form should be "does", not "don't". Additionally, the base form of the verb after "does" should be used, so it should be "like" instead of "likes". A correct version would be "She doesn't like to play soccer."	She doesn't like to play soccer.
1	The sentence "Si è macchiata la tovaglia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "She stained the tablecloth."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Macchia" is a singular third person verb while "il vino" is a plural noun. They do not agree.	The sentence should be: "Il vino si macchia."
1	The sentence "L'acqua è gelata in due ore" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian language structure for expressing that water will be frozen in two hours. It consists of a subject ("l'acqua"), a copula verb ("è") and its past participle form ("gelata"), and an adverbial expression of time ("in due ore").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "hanno" does not agree in number with its subject "le tappe". "Le tappe" is plural, so the verb must also be plural.	Le tappe hanno bruciato per un'ora. (incorrect - no changes needed)

1	The sentence "Paola ha visto la partita con gli amici." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. - "Paola" is the subject in third person singular form. - "ha visto" is the auxiliary verb for past tense in third person singular form which means "has seen". - "la partita" is a feminine noun meaning "the match". - "con" is a preposition used here with the plural masculine noun "gli amici", which translates as "with her friends".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele si è tagliato le basette" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement in Italian tense conjugations.

Additionally, the use of "le" before "basettes" correctly designates the feminine plural direct object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è tagliato el mento con il rasoio." appears to be grammatically correct with one minor exception - the word "el" in the middle of the sentence should actually be "il". This change would result in the corrected sentence "Riccardo si è tagliato il mento con il rasoio.", which means "Riccardo cut his chin with the razor."	Riccardo si è tagliato **il** mento con il rasoio.
1	The sentence "Francesco si è calmato, irrigidito." contains two verbs in past participle form ("calmato" and "irrigidito") which agree with their subject "Francesco". Also, they are correctly connected by a comma, making the sentence grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.

This construction indicates that the action occurred in the past. Additionally, there is the article "un," referring to "a book," and the past participle adjective "caduto," meaning "fallen." Together they make up the object of the sentence. Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "I noticed a fallen book."	The sentence is already correct.

0	The verb "approfitta" requires a direct object to complete its meaning, but none is provided in the sentence.

1	The sentence "Chi Leoardo amava?" is grammatically correct because it follows the structure for asking a question in Italian about who someone loved in the past tense using the verb "amare" which means "to love."

1	The sentence "Francesco è il capo" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian word order and uses proper grammatical forms for each word.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Trenta chili sono pesati da Alessandro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In particular, the subject-verb agreement is respected as "trenta chili" (thirty kilograms) is plural, and therefore requires the use of the third person plural verb form "sono." Additionally, the direct object pronoun "li" is correctly omitted before the past participle "pesato," which agrees with the gender and number of the subject.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Due lingue sono parlate da tutti i miei studenti" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. It means "Two languages are spoken by all my students."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "studies" should be used in singular form ("otto ore al giorno è studiata da Tommaso") because the subject "otto ore al giorno" is singular. Alternatively, you can use the plural noun "ore" as the subject and change the verb accordingly ("le otto ore al giorno sono studiate da Tommaso").	Le ottore al giorno sono studiate da Tommaso.
1	The sentence "Alessandro trivella questa cosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian. In this case, the subject is "Alessandro," the verb is "trivella" (which means "to drill" or "dig"), and the object is "questa cosa" (which means "this thing").	The sentence is already correct.

0	In Italian, "the" is translated as "il" for masculine singular nouns. However, "tea" (the word you want to use here) is a masculine plural noun in Italian, so it should be "i". Also, there is no contraction between subject pronouns and verbs in Italian. Therefore, "Riccardo beve i the..." should actually be "Riccardo beve il te...".	Riccardo beve il te nella tazza di porcellana.
0	The word "Dove" should be "dov'è". In Italian, when asking where someone or something is, you need to use the verb "essere" which means "to be", followed by the subject pronoun and then the question word "dove". So it should be "Dov'è Andrea?"	Dov'è Andrea che ha preso una sigaretta?
0	The verb "estraere" requires the use of the auxiliary verb "ha" instead of "é". Also, there should be no space before the punctuation mark.	Tommaso ha estratto la pistola nel bar.
0	The subject "Riccardo" does not agree with the verb "mangia". "Mangia" is singular while "Riccardo" is plural. It should be "mangiano".	Riccardo **mangiano** il riso. (If we want to indicate more than one person named Riccardo.) If it refers to only one person named Riccardo, the correct form would be: Il signor Riccardo mangia il riso.
0	The subject "Tommaso" is singular, but the verb "sostiene" agrees with a plural subject. It should be "sostiene la lastra".	Tommaso sostiene la lastra.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct with proper spelling, punctuation, and word usage in Italian language.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo prende il libro dalla sala della biblioteca" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar in terms of word order, verb conjugation, and article usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mette le casse sul ripiano del montacarichi." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele puts the boxes on the platform of the lift."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Dove hai messo le foto di Francesco?" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows proper word order and uses appropriate grammar structures for the language. It translates to "Where did you put Francesco's photos?" which is also grammatically correct in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso toglie i soldi dal cassetto" follows proper Italian grammar rules with regards to word order and verb conjugation. It features the subject "Tommaso", the action being performed "toglie" (which agrees in number and gender with its subject), and an object "i soldi". Additionally, it includes a prepositional phrase "dal cassetto." All these elements form a coherent and complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La chiave sta nella toppa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In English, we would say "The key is in the hole," but in Italian, the verb often comes before the subject in statements like these. So "la chiave" (the key) is the subject, "sta" (is) is the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "stare" (to stay), and "nella toppa" (in the hole) is the prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial complement explaining where the key is located.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in "Lorenzo vi ha piantato". It should be "Lui ti ha piantati" because the direct object pronoun "ti" agrees with the indirect object pronoun "lui", and "piantare" requires third person singular verb form "ha" when followed by a plural noun such as "fiori".	Lui ti ha piantati i fiori dal giardino alla strada.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha lanciato il pallone dal balcone al giardino." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object structure with proper tense agreement between subject and verb. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and there are no missing punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject "Leonardo" does not agree with the verb "piantano." Since "Leonardo" is singular, you need to use the third person singular form of the verb which is "ha piantato."	Dal giardino Leonardo ha piantato fiori al garage. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence "Edoardo carica le casse sulla nave" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of a proper subject ("Edoardo"), verb ("carica") in third person singular present tense which agrees with the subject, definite article ("le") referring to plural direct object ("casse"), preposition ("sulla") and another definite article ("nave"). All words have appropriate gender and number agreement throughout the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La scala poggia contro il muro" is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of a subject ("la scala"), a verb in third person singular present tense ("poggia") which agrees with the subject, and an object ("il muro"). Moreover, the preposition "contro" followed by the article "il" forms a proper adverbial phrase indicating where the action takes place.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I rivoltosi incarcerarono Gabriele nelle segrete della fortezza." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all words agree with each other in number, gender, and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Francesco" is singular and masculine, so the verb must agree with it and be in its corresponding form. In this case, the verb "chiudere" should be "chiude", not "chiusa".	Francesco chiude Giulia nella stanza.
0	The verb "chiudere" needs to agree in number with its subject, so it should be "chiusero" since the subject "Gabriele" is singular masculine. Also, "il denaro" means "the money," but we need an object here, for instance, "la porta" (the door).	Gabriele chiuse la porta.
1	The sentence "Gabriele dette appoggio al libro" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele gave support to the book".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro dette appoggio alla diffusione del libro" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro gave support to the dissemination of the book".	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Questo latte deterge le impurità dal volto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "This milk cleanses impurities from the face".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The verb "stipare" agrees with its subject "Riccardo", both in number (singular) and person (third). Also, it uses the correct past tense ("stipò") for a masculine singular direct object ("l'armadio"). Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	Riccardo stipò l'armadio con i vestiti. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for forming the plural form in Italian. Both "la fotografia" and "di Giulia" refer to one person, so when combining them with "e", we need to use the plural form "stanno". This indicates that both photographs are attached.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English and uses proper grammar for verb tense agreement, punctuation, and word usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Francesco avvolge la statua in una tela di lino." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax rules and all words used are correctly spelled and inflected for number, gender, and tense as appropriate.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Andrea accompanied Paola to school." is grammatically correct in English. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order, uses the past tense correctly, and employs proper spelling and punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "stare" agrees in number with its subject, so it should be "stanno" since "i libri" is plural. "Sta" is used for singular subjects.	I libri **stanno** nell'armadio. (The sentence is already correct.)
1	The verb "attraversò" agrees with its subject "Andrea," both in number (singular) and tense (past tense). The preposition "di" is correctly used before "parte." Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "mi" cannot directly follow "ho l'intenzione di". It needs to be connected with another verb in infinitive form. Here's how you can fix it: "Ho l'intenzione di vestirmi da sposa."	The sentence is now correct: "Ho l'intenzione di vestirmi da sposa."
1	The sentence "Francesco mangiava il pane con soddisfazione" follows the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of a simple past tense verb form "mangiava", which agrees with its subject "Francesco". The direct object "il pane" comes before the adverbial expression "con soddisfazione." All words in the sentence match their respective genders and number as required by the language rules. Therefore, it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Quella mattina pioveva a dirotto" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard rules for word order, verb conjugation, and agreement between words within the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "beve" (drinks) must agree in number with its subject. In this case, the subject "il vino" is singular, so the verb should also be singular.ada form ("beve" becomes "bere").	Il vino **ber**e Alessandro.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha telefonato e Maria è venuta" follows the proper structure for expressing two separate actions performed by different subjects in Italian. In particular, it uses the compound past tense correctly with both verbs conjugated according to their respective subject's gender and number.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Tommaso mangia questo." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian subject-verb-object word order, with each word being correctly conjugated for its respective tense and number.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The auxiliary verb used for negation in present simple tense with he/she/it should be 'doesn't' rather than 'don't'. Also, 'like' should be used without -s ending in third person singular context.	She doesn't like you.
1	The sentence "L'artrosi ha paralizzato le ossa." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian grammar rules for word order, verb agreement, and spelling.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In the sentence "Maria vuole lo mangiare," there needs to be a noun after "lo" for it to agree with the verb "mangiare." The pronoun "lo" requires a specific direct object in masculine singular form. A possible correction could be "Maria vuole la mela" ("Maria wants to eat the apple").	Maria vuole la mela.
1	The subject "Lorenzo" is in singular form and matches with the third person singular verb "ammina" which agrees in number and person. Also, it follows the SVO structure (Subject-Verb-Object) where "Alice" is the object being admired by "Lorenzo". Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we use "does" for he/she/it in present simple tense when asking questions and negations. So, it should be "She doesn't like you."	She doesn't like you.
1	The sentence "Edoardo miras alla presidenza" is grammatically correct because all words are spelled correctly and they are in the right order. However, since it seems you intended for the verb "mirare" to agree with its subject "Edoardo," I must point out that "miras" is the second person singular form of the present tense, while "mirare" is the infinitive form. In this case, you need to use "mira" which is the third person singular form.	Edoardo mira alla presidenza.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. It should be "é" instead of "è". Also, there needs to be a comma after "primo."	Primo, é sul letto che Maria salta. (First, she jumps on the bed.)
0	The word "subito" should agree in number with the subject of the sentence. Since "Edoardo" is singular, the correct form of "subito" should be used, which is "subito", not "subiti".	È subito che Edoardo vuole il caffè. Should be corrected as: "È subito che Edoardo vuole il caffè."
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. It should be "È il successo a cui Tommaso aspira."	È il successo a cui Tommaso aspira.
1	The sentence "È alla presidenza che mira Leonardo." follows the rules of Italian grammar and is grammatically correct. It means "It is the presidency that Leo aspires to."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in terms of word choice and structure; however, it would sound more natural to say "She likes to watch movies at the cinema" with an article before "cinema". This makes the corrected sentence clearer for native English speakers as "the cinema" implies a specific movie theater.	She likes to watch movies at the cinema.
1	The sentence "È il cinema che Francesco adora" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the Subject-Verb-Object word order with proper agreement between subject ("il cinema") and verb ("adora").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The subject "il cinema" agrees in number with the verb "adore", so the singular form of the verb should be used. Also, there shouldn't be an accent on the word "e".	Il cinema è quello che Alessandro adora. (or simply "Alessandro adora il cinema")
1	The sentence "I denti di Emma battono dal freddo" follows the rules of Italian grammar and syntax. It contains a subject ("I denti di Emma"), a verb in third person plural present tense ("battono") which agrees with the subject, and an adverbial complement ("dal freddo").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The pronoun "that" refers to the plural noun "women", but it should refer to their legs. Also, there is no verb in the last part of the sentence. A possible correction could be: "Alessandro le adora perché esse hanno gambe lunghe."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea ne adores Emma's friends." is grammatically correct in English as it follows proper subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate prepositions and articles.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mangia un gelato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele is eating an ice cream".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject "Riccardo" has been repeated twice in the sentence, which is unnecessary and incorrect in formal Italian grammar. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be to use one instance of "Riccardo," followed by a pronoun such as "egli" for the second reference.	Riccardo gli promette che verrà.
1	The sentence "Il polpo è divorato da Sofia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The octopus is eaten by Sophia" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "esula" does not agree with its subject "la tolleranza". It should be in singular form ("esclude") instead of plural form ("esulano").	La tolleranza ne exclude i suoi doveri.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ci viene da Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax rules and all words used in the sentence are correctly spelled and inflected for number, gender and tense.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Emma and the movie they both watched" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a subject ("Emma and the movie they both watched") and no verb-subject agreement issue can be identified.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ammira la casa che è di Paola" follows the rules of Italian grammar and is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "assorbire" requires an object in the third person singular form, which would require an -e ending for agreement with the masculine singular noun "Francesco." Currently, there is no such inflection on "assorbire," making it grammatically incorrect.	Beatrice involontariamente assorbe Francesco.*** Note: I added the missing accent to the word "involontariamente".
0	The verb "distribuire" requires an object in the accusative case. In this case, it should be "mattoni", with a final -i, because its plural form must agree with the direct object "Lorenzo".	Lorenzo distribuisce mattoni.
0	In the first part of the sentence "Che Riccardo", there should be a pronoun such as "Come" or "Cosa". Also, in Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, so it should be "Riccardo è pintore e bello."	Come/Cosa dipinge Riccardo, è bello? (Depending on context)
1	The sentence "Sofia walks in Venice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order, and each word is correctly spelled and used in the right tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria raccoglie sassolini" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian. Here, "Maria" is the subject, "raccoglie" is the verb, and "sassolini" is the object. Moreover, all words are spelled correctly and agree with each other in gender and number.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" should agree with the subject in number and tense. In this case, the subject "she" is singular and requires the third person present form of the verb "to do," which is "does." Additionally, the base form of the verb "like" should be used after "does" rather than the third person present form "likes." A corrected version would be "She doesn't like spinach."	She doesn't like spinach.
1	The sentence "Beatrice schermisce con abilità" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice fences with skill."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "travestes" does not exist in Portuguese. It seems there is a confusion between Spanish and Portuguese. In Portuguese, the correct form would be "transforma". Also, the subject-verb agreement is incorrect; it should be "Maria transforma Alice", not "Maria traveste Alice".	Maria transforma Alice.
1	The sentence "Emma umilia Edoardo." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il fulmine cadde sulla testa di Andrea." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order, with proper agreement between the verb and its subject. In addition, all words are spelled correctly and there are no missing punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English grammar, we use "doesn't" for third person singular subjects in the present simple tense when expressing negations. Also, "like" should be used instead of "likes".	She doesn't like to eat vegetables.
1	The sentence "Alessandro dormicchia nell'inazione più totale." follows the rules of Italian grammar and syntax, making it grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct. Note: I am an AI language model, so my assessment is based on the information available in my training data up until 2021. It does not guarantee that all recent changes or regional variations in linguistic conventions will be accounted for.
0	The verb "ha preso" does not agree with its subject "la maionesa." In singular third-person form, it should be "ha preso" for masculine subjects but changes to "ha presa" when the subject is feminine and singular.	La maionese non ha presa bene.
1	The sentence "Maria smiles at Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb-object word order and uses proper spelling and capitalization.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject "Quel vestito" (that dress) agrees with the plural verb form "vanno" (go), but it should agree with the singular verb form "va" (goes).	Quel vestito non va ad Alice. (incorrect - see explanation above) Corrected Sentence: Quei vestiti non vanno ad Alice.
1	The sentence "Il capitale dell'azienda ammonta a molti miliardi." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. "Il" is a masculine singular definite article; "capitale" means capital in English; "dell'azienda" is a genitive expression meaning "of the company"; "ammonta" means amounts; "a" is a preposition meaning "to"; and "molti miliardi" means many billions. Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "The company's capital amounts to many billions".	The sentence is already correct.

The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola luccicava dall'emozione." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the rules for word order, tense agreement, and use of endings on words. In this case, there is a clear subject ("Paola") followed by a verb in past tense ("luccicava"), with an adverbial expression of source ("dall'emozione"). This structure is commonly used in Italian sentences.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Quell'idea si fa chiara nel suo animo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "That idea becomes clear in his/her mind."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele vi ritorna" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele returns to you."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo giunge in casa." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar.

1	The sentence "La scala scende in cantina." follows the rules of Italian grammar and is understandable in context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il sentiero ci arriva." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The path arrives to us" or more naturally translated as "We reach the path".	The sentence is already correct.
0	In Italian, it is important to match the subject-verb agreement in number and person. The verb "patteggiare" must agree with its subject "La Maggioranza," which is third-person plural. However, "patteggia" is third-person singular. Therefore, the verb form used here is incorrect.	La Maggioranza patteggiano con l'Opposizione.
1	The sentence "Emma lotta su questo punto" is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It contains a subject ("Emma"), a verb in third person singular present tense ("lotta", meaning fights), and an object ("questo punto", meaning this point).	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Andrea is brutal with Alice" is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense for the verb "to be."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "colonizzò" does not agree with its subject "Il Giappone". The correct form of the past tense for the third person plural is "colonizzarono".	Il Giappone colonizzarono la Manciuria.
0	The verb "aveva" does not agree with its subject "Leonardo". It should be "Leonardo had amassed packages at the bottom of the bookshelf."	Leonardo hatte Pakete unten an der Bibliothek aufgestapelt. (German translation of the corrected English sentence)
1	The sentence "Leonardo had leaned against the wall." is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a simple past tense verb ("had leaned") paired with its subject ("Leonard"), followed by the preposition "against" and the noun it governs ("the wall"). This structure accurately conveys an action completed in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ammasstack" does not exist in Italian language. It seems like it could be a typo for "accatastare", which means "to pile up". However, even with the correction, the sentence still doesn't make much sense because it lacks context.	Lorenzo ci aveva *piled up* packages. (translated from "Lorenzo ci aveva accatastato pacchi") But note that without proper context, I can only provide an approximate translation of what the corrected sentence might mean.
1	The sentence "L'avaro accumula ricchezze" follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of one independent clause with a subject ("l'avaro") and a verb in third person singular present tense ("accumula"). The noun "ricchezze", which serves as the direct object, agrees with the plural form of the verb. Therefore, I can confirm that it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we need an article ("a" or "an") before most singular nouns. Therefore, the corrected sentence would require the indefinite article "a". Additionally, it should be "Leonardo is important to us", since the verb must agree with its subject in number and person. The possessive form "our" requires a third-person singular verb such as "is".	Leonardo is important to us.
0	The verb "distribuire" needs to agree with its subject in number and gender. In this case, the subject "il sergente" is singular and masculine, so the verb form should also be singular and masculine. Therefore, it should be "distribuisce", not "distribuiscono".	Il Sergente distribuisce il soldato. (If we want to use the plural noun "soldati", the sentence would be: "Il Sergente distribuisce i soldati.", but the meaning changes.)

1	The sentence "Maria afferrò la mano di Lorenzo" is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It uses the correct verb form ("afferrò") which agrees with the subject "Maria", the direct object pronoun "la" refers correctly to "mano", and the indirect object pronoun "di" also refers correctly to "Lorenzo".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Questa medicina coagula il sangue." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax and grammar rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo forgia l'acciaio" follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian and all words are spelled correctly. Therefore it can be considered as grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Il governo converte gli oppositori in criminali." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar, including word order, tense agreement, and subject-verb agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The past tense of "travesty" in Italian is "travestire", so it should be "Alice lo travedìste". Also, since "Francesco" is masculine singular, it needs a masculine singular pronoun, which is "lo".	Alice lo travestì.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ne liberò il cane." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo freed his dog" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lo Stato accorda troppa fiducia all'amministrazione pubblica." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The State places too much trust in public administration."	The sentence is already correct.

It contains a clear subject ("Tommaso"), a verb in past tense ("attribuì") and an indirect object introduced by the preposition "a" ("Leonardo"). The clause "la decisione di andare in Cina" functions as the direct object of the sentence and provides necessary context for who did what.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo addebitava il suo insucesso alla decisione del padre di andare in Francia." follows all the grammatical rules for Italian language.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "abbandona" does not agree with its subject "Francesco". It should be "abbandona" in its third person singular form ("abbandona" is used for first and second person plural and all persons plural).	Francesco abbandona la moglie sulla strada. (incorrect as it stands, but I assume you meant to say "abbandona", which would make the corrected version above)
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "I ladri" (the thieves) is plural, so the verb must also be plural. However, "rubano" (they steal/are stealing) is already the plural form of "rubare." Therefore, there shouldn't be an extra "ono" at the end of "rubano," making it "ruba" instead.	I ladri rubano le auto ai legittimi proprietari. (should be "I ladri rubano" without the extra "no")
1	The sentence "Maria spalmò il pane con il coltello." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper grammatical forms for each word.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "mise" does not exist in Italian language. Also, "tavolo" means table and "cappello" means hat, so it seems there is an error also with the nouns used in the sentence. A possible correction could be: "Riccardo posizionò il cappello sul tavolo".	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction could be: "Riccardo posizionò il cappello sul tavolo".
1	The sentence "L'aviazione nemica bombardò napalm sulla città." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The enemy aviation bombed napalm on the city" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "imbeve" does not agree with the subject "Andrea". It should be "bagnia" instead. Also, there should be an accent on the word "il", making it "l'".	Andrea bagna il pane di vino.
1	The sentence "Raso rosso foderava i cuscini" follows all the rules of Italian grammar, making it grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo dissemina aneddoti divertenti nei suoi racconti." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo sprinkles funny anecdotes in his stories."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "disseminare" requires an object to which something is being scattered. In this case, there is no explicit object in the sentence.

0	The verb "pompare" requires an object in the accusative case after it, but here we have "l'acqua" which is in the singular definite article form. It should be changed into the accusative plural form "le acque".	Tommaso pompava le acque dal lago alla piscina.
1	The subject-verb agreement is correct in both clauses ("Alessandro e Leonardo" is plural, so "negoziano" which is also plural agrees with it.) The word order follows standard Italian rules for compound subjects connected by "e."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct with no spelling errors or awkward phrasing. It follows standard English syntax rules for word order and uses proper punctuation.

1	The sentence "Tommaso alternates Beatrice with Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the English syntax rules for expressing an action performed by a subject on two objects using the verb "alternate."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "L'amore lega" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the rules for word order and agreement between words. In this case, "l'amore" means "love," and "lega" means "binds." So, the sentence can be translated into English as "Love binds."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" should be used with negative statements and questions in English. For affirmative sentences, we use the base form of the verb. In this case, the subject "she" requires the third person singular present tense form of the verb "like", which is "likes". Therefore, the sentence should be "She doesn't like apples."	She doesn't like apples.
1	The sentence "Maria desidera un libro." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all words are correctly conjugated for gender and number.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria desidera il fatto che tu venga" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In particular, the verb "desiderare" requires the subjunctive mood in this context, which is correctly used here with "venga".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo tiene alla possibilità che lo promuovano" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo hopes for the possibility that they promote him".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject "Giulia" agrees with the verb "abbandona", but there is an inconsistency between the subjects "vedrà" and "Edoardo". In Italian, the formal way to say "you will see" is "lei vedrà", while talking about someone else would require using "egli/ella vedrà". Therefore, it needs to be changed to either "Giulia abbandona l'idea che egli/ella vedrà Edoardo" or "Giulia abbandona l'idea di vederlo/vederla con Edoardo."	Giulia abbandona l'idea di vederlo/vederla con Edoardo.
1	The sentence "Maria made the statement that Francesco is handsome" is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense for past action with the auxiliary verb "has." Additionally, it employs the correct third person singular form of the verb "is," which agrees with its subject "Francesco."	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Edoardo approva che Maria parta" follows all the grammatical rules in Italian. It consists of two main verbs ("approva" and "parte") conjugated correctly according to their respective subjects ("Edoardo" and "Maria"), and it also includes an appropriate subordinating conjunction ("che").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Emma dubita di che Alice parta" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Emma doubts that Alice will leave."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "viaggi" should agree with its subject in number, but "Che Lorenzo" is singular while "viaggi" is plural. Also, there seems to be no relationship between "Lorenzo", "angoscia" (anguish), and "Tommaso". A more grammatical version could be: "Che angoscia provoca i viaggi di Lorenzo a Tommaso?" which means "What anxiety does Lorenzo's travels cause Tommaso?"	Che angoscia provoca i viaggi di Lorenzo a Tommaso?
0	The word "ciò" needs to agree in number with what it refers to, which is "l'idea", so it should be "cia". Also, there shouldn't be an apostrophe before "l'idea".	Riccardo lo approva l'idea cia.
0	In English, when we have a subject pronoun followed by a verb in the present tense, there shouldn't be an article between them. So "approves" should directly follow "Edoardo".	The sentence should be: "Edoardo lo approva che Maria canti." However, note that even with this correction, it still wouldn't be completely grammatically correct in Italian due to other errors such as the lack of a conjunction between clauses. A more accurate way to express this idea would be "Edoardo approva il fatto che Maria canta."
0	The verb "desideri" does not agree with the subject "tu." It should be "vuoi" instead. Also, there should be a conjunction between the two independent clauses "Tu vuoi" and "Sofia venire."	Vuoi che Sofia venga? (Do you want Sofia to come?)
0	The verb "va" in Italian should be followed by a noun or pronoun indicating where someone or something is going. In this case, it looks like there is an attempt to say "Riccardo goes to the smoke," but "al fumo" does not make sense as a location in Italian. Instead, one might say "Riccardo va al bar" ("Riccardo goes to the bar") or "Riccardo va fuori a fumare" ("Riccardo goes outside to smoke").	The sentence is not correct. A possible correction could be: "Riccardo va al bar."
1	The sentence "Alice brama di tornare" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alice yearns to return".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "incoraggiare" requires the infinitive form of the second verb after it. Instead, we have the subjunctive form "si sposi". It should be "a sposarsi".	Andrea incoraggia Maria a sposarsi.
1	The sentence "Il fatto che Emma parli allieta suo padre." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar in terms of word order, verb conjugation, and agreement between words.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject "Andare al cinema" is an infinitive verb form and cannot act as the subject of a sentence in English. A noun or pronoun must serve as the subject. Additionally, there is no main verb in the sentence.	Going to the cinema excites Sofia.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "La" is singular while "riddono" is plural. They must agree in number.	Le colpisce che Riccardo rid**a**. (Rid**e** should be changed to Rid**a**)
1	The sentence "Mi meraviglia il fatto che Beatrice sia svestita." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I am surprised by the fact that Beatrice is undressed".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject "Leonardo" is repeated unnecessarily in the second clause, which makes the sentence sound awkward and ungrammatical. A corrected version would only include one instance of "Leonardo."	Leonardo allieta perché Maria ride. (Corrected: Leonardo cheers up because Maria laughs.)
1	The sentence "La tristezza e la noia deprimono Gabriele." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sadness and boredom depress Gabriel".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is constructed using the present tense of the Italian language and it follows proper subject-verb agreement rules as well as word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La sola presenza di Alice mi acquieta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The mere presence of Alice calms me down" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Parlare con le ballerine è divertente." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Talking with the ballerinas is fun."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Io vengo affascinato dal fatto che Edoardo parla di poesia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I am fascinated by the fact that Edward talks about poetry".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "di vedere" (to see) needs to agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, since "Paola" is singular and feminine, the verb should also be conjugated in third-person singular feminine form, which would be "vede." Additionally, there seems to be an extra word "accadde," meaning "happened," making the sentence ungrammatical as it doesn't make sense in context.	La vista dei marziani le capitò a Paola. (This translates roughly to "She encountered Martians' sighting.")
1	The sentence "Aver vinto al lotto splendeva nel suo sguardo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Having won the lottery, it shone in her gaze."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Di aver vinto" should be changed to "di aver vinto**e**". Also, there should be a comma after "primo premio".	La gioia di aver vinto**,** il primo premio**,** splendeva nel suo sguardo.
0	The word "tratta" should be replaced with "trattiene," which means "holds." Also, there needs to be an accent on the letter "e" in "dobbiamo" for it to be grammatically correct. Additionally, since we are using the formal form of address, "Lei" requires an initial capital letter.	Si **trattiene** che Dobbiamo fuggire. (Alternatively, "Si deve trattenere il fatto che dobbiamo fuggire.")
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Si" is singular and requires a singular verb form such as "tratta". However, "tratte" is used which is plural.	Si tratta.
1	The sentence is structurally and grammaticality correct in Italian. "Il fatto che" is used correctly as a subordinating conjunction introducing the clause "Emma sia uscita così presto", which means "that Emma left so early". This clause modifies "denota" (denotes). The subject-verb agreement is also correct between "Emma" and "sia". Additionally, the tense usage is appropriate; "sia uscita" indicates an action completed at a time previous to another one ("in questo momento").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "condanno" agrees with the subject "Io", but in past tense it should be "con**dann**ai". Also, there shouldn't be a space before the punctuation mark.	Io condannai il fatto che Erode uccise i bambini.
1	The sentence "Gabriele adora carezzare Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb-object structure in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject, "adora" is the verb, and "carezzare Andrea" is the object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea intends to marry Alice" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a proper subject ("Andrea"), an auxiliary verb ("intends") used in the present tense to indicate future action, and the infinitive form of the main verb ("to marry"). The object of the sentence, "Alice", follows the main verb. This structure creates a clear and complete thought with no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo evita guardare la televisione" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo avoids watching TV."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "é" should be used instead of "è". Also, there should not be a space before the conjunction "e".	Paola ritiene che si parte è carino. -> Corrected as: Paola ritiene che si parti è carino. But it would still be more correct to say "Paola thinks that going is nice." in English, so: "Paola ritiene che sia carino."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo riteneva Alice fosse Paola" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo thought Alice was Paula".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains an improper use of the conjunction "che". It should be used as "Beatrice lo giudica per il fatto che Maria ha troppi amanti" or "Beatrice lo giudica perché Maria ha troppi amanti."	Beatrice lo giudica perché Maria ha troppi amanti.
0	The verb "giudicare" requires the subjunctive mood after expressions like "lo", "la", "lui", "le", etc. Therefore, it should be "giudichi" instead of "giudica". Also, there shouldn't be a relative pronoun "che" in this case.	Sophia lo giudica avere troppe amanti.
1	The sentence contains a relative clause "that Maria is beautiful" in English, which translates correctly into Italian as "che Maria è bella". In addition, all words have been conjugated properly according to their respective genders and numbers.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo lo suppone che il padre beva troppo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar in terms of word order, verb conjugation, and agreement between subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject ("I") in the English sentence does not have a corresponding subject pronoun in Italian. In Italian, the first person singular subject pronoun "io" must be used before the verb "penso".	La frase corretta dovrebbe essere: "Io penso qualcosa di te."
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Penso" means "I think", so it requires a singular verb form after it. However, "ami" is the second person singular form, which does not match with the first person singular subject "io". Instead, you need to use the third person singular form "ama", which matches the genderless third person singular direct object pronoun "il" before "tartufo".	La sentenza è già corretta. (This sentence is already correct.) Io, di te, penso che tu ami il tartufo. (I think that you love truffles.)
1	The sentence "Emma obtains something from you." is grammatically correct in English. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object structure, where the subject ("Emma") performs the action denoted by the verb ("obtains"), which acts upon the object ("something"). Additionally, the preposition "from" followed by "you" correctly indicates the source of what Emma is obtaining.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "lavora" does not agree with its subject "Alice". It should be in third person singular form "lavora", but since "Maria" is also mentioned in the sentence, it implies two people working together, so a better choice would be a verb in first person plural form.	Noi lavoriamo a catturare Maria.
1	The UAE agree to normalize relations, boosting Middle East peace prospects. This sentence is a headline taken from a news article, so it follows different grammar rules compared to standard English sentences. It is acceptable in this context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria ci aspira" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria ci si aggrappa" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria clings to it".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola looks forward to ensuring that the future will be happy" in English corresponds to the Italian sentence "Paola mira a che il futuro sia felice". Both sentences are grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Giulia guardava il muro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia was looking at the wall" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Riccardo" is singular, so the verb form should also be singular. It should be "pensa", not "pensano".	Riccardo lo pensa.
0	The verb "leghino" does not agree with its subject in number. It should be "leggano" since the subject "paola" is singular but "leghino" is plural. Also, there should be a preposition before "che". A possible correction could be: "Paola accetta di essere legata."	Paola accetta di essere legata.
0	The verb "sorridere" requires the preposition "di" only when followed by an action or event, but in this case it is followed by a fact, so the correct preposition is "per".	Alice sorride per il fatto di aver pianto.
1	The sentence "La condizione di disagio nasce dalla mancanza d'acqua" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The condition of discomfort arises from the lack of water."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "risultare" requires the third person singular form ("da questa analisi risulta **egli**/**esso**"), so it does not agree with the subject "il nostro partire". Also, there needs to be an auxiliary verb such as "essere" in order for the past participle "partito" to correctly agree with its subject.	Da quest'analisi risulta essere stato il nostro partire.
1	The sentence "La tosse dipende dal fatto di aver fumato troppo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Cough depends on having smoked too much."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo clarifies that it isn't his fault to Paola" is grammatically correct with one minor change - it should be "on" instead of "to." This preposition indicates the indirect object in English. So the corrected version would read: "Leonardo clarifies that it isn't his fault to Paola" -> "Leonardo clarifies that it isn't his fault **ON** Paola." However, since I have limited context about the intended meaning, I cannot assure you that this change conveys the message as initially desired by the speaker.	Leonardo clarifies that it isn't his fault on Paola. (Alternatively, if the original intention was for him to clarify something to Paola, then "clarify to someone" can work, but it requires rephrasing): Leonardo clarifies the situation to Paola; it wasn't his fault.
0	The verb "fischia" agrees with the gender of the speaker, but in this case we don't know who is speaking so it would be more appropriate to use the third person singular form "fischia". Also, there should be a comma after "Maria".	Andrea fischia a Maria, che ha fame. Or alternatively: Andrea suona il flauto per Maria che ha fame.
0	The verb "accennerà" does not exist in Italian. It seems like there is a typo and it should be "accennerà" which means "will hint". Also, the subject "Andrea" is missing before the verb.	Andrea accennerà ad Edoardo se parte o no.
1	The sentence "Paola addebita a Leonardo il fatto che ora ha fame" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo lo aggiunge nel suo discorso" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo adds it to his speech".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria bet him on it." is grammatically correct in English as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and contains proper tense agreement between the subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "giornalisti" needs to agree in number with the subject it refers to, which is "molti", so it should be "i giornalisti". Also, there should be a preposition before "il fatto" because it starts a new clause.	Il giornalisti attaccano sui quotidiani il fatto che molti politici sono corrotti. The sentence should be: "I giornalisti attaccano sui quotidiani il fatto che molti politici siano corrotti."
1	The sentence follows all the rules of standard Italian grammar, making it grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Emma ne avvisa Alessandro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It consists of three words - "Emma" (subject pronoun), "ne" (particle used as a substitute for a preceding word), and "avvisa" (verb meaning "to warn"). The whole sentence can be translated into English as "Emma warns him about it".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele lo convince che lo sciopero è giusto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. It consists of three simple sentences connected by conjunctions: "Gabriele lo convince", "che" and "lo sciopero è giusto". Each part contains a subject ("Gabriele", "lo" which refers to someone previously mentioned in the conversation, "lo sciopero") and a verb ("convince", "è"). Moreover, the use of tenses is appropriate as well as the agreement between subjects and verbs.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "esime" does not exist in Italian language. Moreover, it seems that there is a repetition of the subject "Riccardo". A possible correction could be "Riccardo si esenta dal viaggio", meaning "Riccardo excuses himself from the trip".	Riccardo si esenta dal viaggio.
1	The sentence "Il sindaco esenta i poveri dal pagare il bus" is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of a subject ("il sindaco"), a verb in third person singular present tense ("esenta"), an indirect object ("i poveri") with the preposition "di", another indirect object ("il bus") also with the preposition "del," and the gerund form of the verb "pagare." All words agree in number and gender, as required by Italian grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is structurally correct with proper use of grammar, verb conjugations, and word order in Italian language.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alice discorre di partire con Giulia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alice talks about leaving with Julia."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria si accorge di essere innamorata dal fatto di arrossire" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar in terms of word order, verb conjugation, and agreement between subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "mangia" in number and person, so there is no grammatical error in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "indugere" requires the infinitive form of the following verb, so it should be "farlo mangiare" instead of "mangiare". Also, there shouldn't be an article before "Leonardo".	Leo lo indugia a farlo mangiare.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Edoardo" is singular, so the verb must also be singular. However, "osa" is plural. It should be "ossa."	Edoardo ossa mangiare.
1	The sentence "Paola è capace di cavalcare" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. It uses the third person singular form of the verb "essere" which agrees with the subject "Paola." The word "capace" means capable and "di" is used as a preposition here. Lastly, "cavalcare" means to ride, specifically in reference to horses. Therefore, the entire sentence can be translated to "Paola is able to ride (a horse)" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria has the intention to ride" is grammatically correct in English. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper tense.	The sentence is already correct. Well done!
0	The verb "suole" does not agree with its subject "Tommaso". It should be "suola" in the third person singular form.	Tommaso suola il pasto. (should be "suola", not "suole")
1	The subject-verb agreement is correct in "Riccardo does have to eat it." Since "Riccardo" is singular, we use the third person singular form of the verb, which is "does have".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "usare" should be used here, which means "to use". Also, there shouldn't be "mangiarlo" at the end since it is an object in this context. A correct version would be "Gabriele usa la mela." if we want to say "Gabriele eats the apple."	The sentence is not correct. It could be corrected as follows: "Gabriele usa la mela."
1	The sentence "Riccardo va in camera." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax rules and all words used are correctly spelled.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "sale" does not agree with the subject "Andrea". It should be "andra" to match the gender and number of the subject.	Andrea **andra** in camera. (Note: I put two asterisks around the word "andra" because it would only display one asterisk due to formatting limitations.)
1	The sentence "Riccardo sparisce da Parigi." follows the standard subject-verb-location structure in Italian and all words used are correctly spelled with appropriate grammatical endings based on their role in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Edoardo parte a Parigi." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In this sentence, "Edoardo" is the subject, "parte" is the verb in its third person singular form, and "a Parigi" indicates where he is going.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola sgambetta verso il ponte." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola walks towards the bridge.", where "sgambetta" is a colloquial verb meaning "to walk with long strides". All words are correctly inflected according to their grammatical gender and number, and there are no spelling mistakes.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La folla lo corre a salutare" follows the rules of Italian grammar and syntax. It consists of a subject ("la folla"), a direct object pronoun ("lo") referring back to a previously mentioned noun, and an infinitive verb form with its accompanying preposition ("corre a salutare"). Therefore, it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In the sentence "Tommaso invia Emma in piazza," there is no grammatical error; however, it would be more complete and clear with an object indicating what Emma is being sent to do or where she is going in the square. For instance, adding "a comprare il pane" ("to buy bread") would improve clarity.	The sentence is almost correct but could benefit from further specificity. Example: Tommaso invia Emma in piazza a comprare il pane.
1	The sentence "Beatrice assembla un computer" is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order and all words agree with each other in number and gender.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il film è di Scorsese." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in Italian. In this case, "il film" is the subject which requires the third person singular form of the verb "essere," which is correctly used as "è". Additionally, "di Scorsese" indicates possession, meaning the movie belongs to Scorsese. Therefore, there is no need to change anything in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola works." is grammatically correct in English. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object structure with no apparent grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows proper grammatical rules for word order, verb conjugations, and agreement in Italian. It also uses an apostrophe correctly to indicate possession.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In the sentence, there is an incorrect repetition of "le". It should be "Molti loro leggono il giornale." The word "molti" agrees in gender and number with "loro", so it must come before "leggono". Also, the pronoun "le" can be omitted as it is redundant.	The sentence corrected would be "Molti loro leggono il giornale.", which means "Many of them read the newspaper."
1	The sentence "Quell'alcuni musei sono stati progettati da architetto" is grammatically correct with only one minor correction needed for clarity. In Italian, it's more common to specify which type of architect you mean, so the sentence would read better as follows:	La qualche Museo è stato progettato da un architetto. (Note: I changed from plural to singular since "qualche" refers to some individual items.)
1	The sentence "Paola mangia la pizza." follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian. The subject "Paola" agrees with the verb "mangia" in number and gender. The direct object "la pizza" also agrees with the verb in gender and number. All words are spelled correctly and there are no grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ha" should agree in number with its subject, which is "quell'architetto". Therefore, it should be "ha" (singular form) instead of "hanno" (plural form). Also, "progettato" should be in agreement with "alcuni", so it should be "alcuni progetti" instead.	Quell'architetto ha progettato alcuni musei.
0	In Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, except for articles and some demonstrative and possessive adjectives. Here, "molte" comes before "ragazze", but it should come after it ("tante ragazze"). Also, there's an extra comma between "molte" and "il".	Hanno letto tante ragazze il giornale l'anno scorso.
1	The sentence "Le spalle di Riccardo toccano la parete" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo's shoulders touch the wall".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The verb "sarà" agrees with its subject "Maria", so the sentence is grammatically correct in terms of agreement. Also, the past participle "toccata" agrees with the auxiliary verb "sarà" through the use of the feminine singular form. Additionally, there seems to be no spelling mistakes and punctuation is used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "sei" should agree in number with its subject, which is "tu." Therefore, it should be "sei" instead of "sia," since "tu sei" is the second person singular form while "siate" is the second person plural form. Also, there seems to be an extra space before "partita."	Che tu seipartira rallegra Beatrice.
1	The sentence "Gabriele è il marito di Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In this sentence, "Gabriele" is the subject, which agrees with the third-person singular verb form "è". The preposition "di" introduces the possessive relationship between "il marito" (the husband) and "Paola", who is identified by her name. Overall, the word order in the sentence is clear and easy to understand, making it an acceptable sentence in Italian.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, auxiliary verbs such as "have" need to come before the subject when forming questions ("Do I have..."), but they follow the subject in affirmative statements. Therefore, the correct form for an affirmative statement with the verb "to have" is "I have," not "I am have." The word order issue makes the sentence ungrammatical.	I have three cats.
1	The sentence "Paola ha messo la macchina che è del fratello nel garage" is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. - "Paola" is correctly capitalized and in the subject form. - "ha messo" is the third person singular indicative present tense form of the verb "mettere", which means "to put". It agrees with the subject "Paola." - "la macchina" is the direct object of the sentence, and its gender ("la") matches the gender of what it refers to, as well as being in the accusative case. - "che è del frattelo" is a relative clause modifying "macchina," indicating possession. - "nel garage" is the prepositional phrase specifying where the action took place.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "obbedisce" requires a direct object in the accusative case in Italian, but "Maria" is in the nominative case. Also, there needs to be a preposition before "Maria". A possible correction could be "Tommaso obbedisce a Maria."	The sentence is already correct. If it needed correction, I would have provided an example as shown in the prompt instructions.
0	In the sentence, there are two instances of "Andrea", which can lead to confusion. It's unclear who is doing the action and who is being confronted.	The sentence is not clear and needs to be rephrased for clarity. For instance: "Andrea confronts Leonardo." or "Leonardo is confronted by Andrea."
1	The subject "Maria" agrees in number and person with the verb "fotografa", so the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha statto smanoso" contains only one minor error - there is an extra "t" in the past participle form of the verb "stare," which should be "ha sta**s**to." Other than that, it follows proper Italian grammar rules for subject-verb agreement and tense consistency.	Lorenzo ha **sta**sto smanoso. Confidence: 95%
1	The sentence "Tua sorella guarda il gelato." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian, with all words agreeing in number and gender.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tua sorella guarda il CD" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax rules and all words used in the sentence have their proper function. In particular: - "tua sorella" is the subject in nominative case; - "guarda" is the verb in third person singular form ("she watches"); - "il CD" is the direct object in accusative case.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sofia cut off the buffalo's head" is grammatically correct in English as it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Sofia"), an auxiliary verb ("cut"), a past participle ("off") and an object ("the buffalo's head").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sofia cut off the heads of the bulls" is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate tense for past actions. All words are spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The verb "taglierebbero" agrees in number and tense with its subject "I ragazzi". Also, the spelling and punctuation are correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "È il toro che Maria ha preso per le corna e non il bufalo." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows all the rules for word order, verb conjugations, and gender agreement between nouns and adjectives.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria stende il bucato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria hangs out the washing".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il mio amico abbaia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "My friend is barking".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ululates" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a proper noun "Riccardo", which refers to a male name, followed by a verb "ululates". Since the subject-verb agreement is consistent with each other, hence it can be concluded as grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The verb "dormì" agrees with its subject "Gabriele," which is in past tense singular form, so the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il cane si è fermato in un battito di occhi" is grammatically correct as it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. However, I noticed that there seems to be a discrepancy between what you wrote ("batter") and what you intended to ask for ("battito"). So, I will assume that the correct form is "battito".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Edoardo ci ha messo due ore per tagliare il filo elettrico" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax and contains proper word choices and verb conjugations.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo ha sezionato il vecchio tiglio." follows the rules of Italian grammar and syntax, so it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Le sei bombesono esplose il 6 maggio 1999." is grammatically correct as it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo non ha più l'abitudine di fumare." follows all grammar rules in Italian language. It uses the correct verb tense (passato prossimo), articles, nouns, and adverbs. Therefore it can be considered as grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea became skillful" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Andrea"), verb ("became"), and object complement ("skillful").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha fatto gli auguri a Giulia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an action performed by a subject in Italian. In this case, the subject is "Tommaso," who performs the action "ha fatto" (has made), which is directed towards "Giulia" through the use of the preposition "a". Additionally, the direct object is correctly marked with the definite article "gli", as expected when referring to people using masculine plural nouns.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sofia asks that you return immediately" is grammatically correct in English. It contains a subject ("Sofia"), a verb in the third person singular present tense ("asks"), an object ("that you return immediately") and follows the standard structure of an English declarative sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. It should be "dispiacere" instead of "dispiace". Also, there should be an accent on the word "tu", making it "tù".	Che tú vada via dispiace a Beatrice. (Note: This correction assumes an Italian language context for the original sentence.)
1	The sentence "I bambini hanno calpestato le aiuole" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The children have trampled on the flower beds."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "eruttare" does not agree with its subject "I bambini". "Eruzzare" should be used in the third person plural form, which is "eruttano".	I bambini eruttano lava.
1	The sentence "Quell'uomo ha fotografato l'unico testimone e ciò è avvenuto un mese fa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "That man photographed the only witness and it happened a month ago."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The subject "Quell'uomo" agrees with the verb "ha", so the sentence is grammatically correct in terms of agreement between subject and verb. Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea ha carezzato il volto a Beatrice" follows the standard format for expressing an action performed by a subject on an object in Italian. In this case, "Andrea" is the subject who performs the action "ha carezzato" which means "has caressed." The object being acted upon is "il volto," meaning "the face," while "a Beatrice" indicates the recipient or direction of the action. Therefore, it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il volto di Paola è carezzato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola's face is being caressed" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Edoardo ha fratturato il braccio di Maria." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo broke Maria's arm."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo ha paralizzato il braccio a Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar in terms of word order, verb conjugation, tense agreement, and proper use of prepositions.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Bambino" is singular, so the verb must also be singular. The plural form "pesavano" should be replaced with the singular form "pesava".	Il bambino pesava nove chili a pochi mesi. (The baby weighed nine kilos after just a few months.)
1	The sentence "Gli operai asfaltarono la strada." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The workers paved the road" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola elencò l'invitato" is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all words agree with each other in number and gender. In particular, "Paola" is feminine singular, and both "elencò" and "l'invitato" are conjugated/formed accordingly.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors. "Alice ha messe" should be "Alice ha messo", as "ha" requires an object in the third person singular form ("messo"). Additionally, there should be only one "e" between "ha messo" and "ciò". Lastly, "ciò" doesn't seem appropriate here; it would work better with "questo" or "questa" depending on context. However, without additional information about what exactly she put into the closet, I can't provide a precise correction for that part.	Alice ha messo qualcosa nell'armadio.
1	The sentence "Maria ha tolto i vestiti e ciò è accaduto nell'armadio." follows all the rules of Italian grammar and syntax. It contains a proper subject-verb agreement, and the verb tenses match with their corresponding subjects. Also, the adjective "bello" agrees in gender and number with its noun "lei".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The noun "frutta" needs an article in Italian. It can either be "la frutta" (feminine singular definite article) or "dei frutti" (masculine plural partitive article).	Beatrice riempie il frigo con la frutta / Beatrice riempie il frigo con dei frutti.
1	The sentence "Maria defends Andrea from dangers." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Maria"), verb ("defends") and two objects ("Andrea" and "dangers"). The tense is past tense which indicates that Maria performed the action in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence "Il libro passa da Maria a Maria." is incorrect because it is ambiguous as written. It can either mean "The book passes from Mary to Mary" or "The book passes by Mary to Mary". To make the meaning clear, you could rephrase it as "Il libro passa da Maria **a** Maria." for the former meaning or "Il libro passa da Maria **per poi** arrivare a Maria." for the latter meaning.	Il libro passa da Maria a Maria. (with added disambiguating word)
1	The sentence "Maria dà un libro a Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian. In this case, "Maria" is the subject, "dà" is the verb, and "un libro a Paola" is the object. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no grammatical errors such as missing endings or wrong genders for nouns and adjectives.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Francesco delega Gabriele suo rappresentante" is grammatically correct. It follows proper Italian syntax rules where the subject comes before the verb and there are no obvious grammatical errors in it.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sofia delegates Maria as her representative" is grammatically correct in English. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order, uses proper tense, and all words are spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The conjunction "e" should only be used once in this context. A more appropriate word would be "dove", which means "where".	Lorenzo abita dove ciò succede a Roma.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha mangiato la pizza e ciò è successo al ristorante" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo ate the pizza and that happened at the restaurant."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sofia fuma una bionda" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian word order and verb conjugations. In English, it would translate to "Sophia smokes a blond one," with "blond one" referring to a type of cigarette commonly sold in Italy known as "bionda."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Edoardo ha spalmato il paté sul pane." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows all the rules for word order, verb conjugation, and article usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea ha spalmato il pane di paté." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for the past tense ("ha spalmato") and definite article with the nouns ("il", "la").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "piovevano" agrees with the subject "le bombe", but in English, we would say "the bombs were raining down on us". In English, the past tense of rain is "rained", so "piovveano" should be replaced with "rainded".	The bombs had rained down on us. (Note: A better translation for the original Italian sentence might be "Bombs were raining down on us.")
0	The verb "funzionare" agrees with the plural subject "I matrimoni," so it needs to be conjugated as "funzionano." However, in the given sentence, it is written as "funziona," which only agrees with a singular subject.	I matrimoni misti funzionano perfettamente.
1	The sentence "La tua idea equivale alla mia" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar for forming an equivalency statement between two nouns.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La tua idea e la mia si equivalgono" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for forming a plural noun in Italian by using "si" before "equivalgono". This construction indicates that both ideas are equivalent.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Edoardo gira per la città." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar in terms of word order and spelling. It can be translated as "Edoardo walks around the city" which makes sense and there are no missing or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Giulia torna da Milano a Napoli." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the proper word order and uses appropriate verb forms for the subject "Giulia". It means "Giulia returns from Milan to Naples" which is semantically valid as well.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo controlla Paola." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo checks Paola" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is structurally and grammatical correct in Italian. It means "Maria agrees that her daughter goes out with that boy."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "bada" needs to agree in number with its subject. In this case, it should be "badano" because the subjects "Alice" and "Maria" are both plural.	Alice e Maria badano.
1	The sentence "Paola doubts you." is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a proper subject ("Paola"), a verb in third person singular present tense ("doubts") and an object ("you"). The word order follows the standard pattern for simple sentences in English (Subject-Verb-Object).	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria desidera che tu parta" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for forming a subjunctive mood in Italian. In particular, the verb "desiderare" requires the use of the subjunctive when followed by the conjunction "che". The subject-verb agreement is also correct with "tu" as the subject and "parta" being its corresponding singular second person present tense form of the verb "andare".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Che Giulia sia sempre in viaggio piace ad Andrea." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. It contains a subjunctive mood verb ("sia") which is used appropriately here since it expresses doubt, uncertainty, or possibility. Also, the word order is correct and all words agree with each other in number and gender.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Emma voluntarily fascinates Francesco" is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense. All words used are spelled correctly and there are no missing or extra components.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Francesco desidera che lui venga" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for forming subjunctive mood in Italian. In particular, "venga" is the singular, third person, present tense of the subjunctive form of the verb "venire". This form is used after certain verbs such as "desiderare" which express wishes or desires.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo annota sul taccuino che il presidente scriverà la sua autobiografia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Leonardo takes notes in his notebook that the president will write his autobiography" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "invitare" requires an indirect object to indicate who is being invited, which in this case seems to be "Paola". However, it looks like there is a preposition "a" before "che", making it unclear what "a" refers to. Also, "si parta" needs to agree with the subject "Alessandro", so it should be "si parte". A possible correction could be: "Alessandro invita a Paola a partire."	Alessandro invita a Paola a partire.
1	The sentence "Alice ha accompanagnato Tommaso al cinema." is grammatically correct with one minor exception. It appears there may be a typo in the verb form used for "accompanied". In Italian, the past participle for regular verbs ending in -are changes according to gender when used with auxiliary verb "avere" ("ha"). Since both characters mentioned are third person singular, the masculine singular form should have been used here. Therefore, it should be "ha accompagnato", as follows:	Alice l'ha accompagnato al cinema.
1	The sentence "La partenza apporta un beneficio a tutti" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Departure brings a benefit to all."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro si lamenta del mare sporco con Paola." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro complains about the dirty sea with Paola."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alice mette in agitazione Tommaso" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian subject-verb-object word order, with each word inflected properly for number and person.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "lasciare" requires an object in this context. Also, there should be only one direct object for each action expressed by a verb. In this case, we have two objects ("a Leonardo" and "pieni poteri") which makes the sentence ungrammatical.	Andrea lascia a Leonardo i suoi pieni poteri.
0	The verb "piangere" requires an object in this context. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "Il piatto è rotto e per questo sta versando acqua," which means "The plate is broken and for this reason it is spilling water." Correct Sensitive: The sentence is not correct.	Il piatto è rotto e per questo versa acqua.
0	The verb "girare" requires an object in this context, but there isn't one provided in the sentence. A more appropriate formulation would be "Mi girano la testa," which means "I have a headache."	The sentence should be "Mi girano la testa."
1	The sentence "Alice si è attaccata a un capello" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for forming the reflexive past tense in Italian. In this case, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun, indicating that the action is performed by the subject on itself. Additionally, "è attaccata" is the conjugated form of the verb "attaccare" (to attach) in the third person singular feminine form (she) in the present perfect indicative tense. This indicates that the action occurred in the past but has relevance to the present. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria ha piantato Riccardo in asso" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Maria"), verb ("ha piantato") and object ("Riccardo"). Moreover, "piantare in asso" is an idiomatic expression meaning "to leave someone hanging", which is used correctly here.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Sofia and Riccardo speak the same language." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and word usage.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "avere" means "to have," but it needs to agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is "lei" which is singular and feminine, so the verb should be "ha" rather than "hanno."	Lei ha fegato.
0	The verb "avere" needs to agree in number with its subject, so it should be "hanno" since the subject "le persone" is plural. Also, there shouldn't be a space before punctuation marks in Italian.	Le persone hanno le paturnie.
0	The phrase "Avere sulle scatole" is ungrammatical in Italian as it does not form a proper sentence. It seems like an isolated expression without any context. To make it meaningful, we need to provide more information. For instance, one could say "Hanno delle cose sulle scatole," which means "(They) have stuff on their boxes."	The sentence needs additional context to become grammatical.
0	The verb "essere" needs to agree with its subject in number and gender. In this case, the subject is "un ventre," which is singular and masculine, so the verb should also be singular and masculine. Therefore, it should be "è" instead of "sono."	Essere IN UN VENTRE DI VACCA. (Note: I have capitalized the initial letter of each word as it is standard practice for proper nouns and the first word of a sentence.)
1	The sentence "Questa situazione ti ha messo nell'occhio del ciclone" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb conjugations and word forms for each part of speech.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo hopes he can leave soon" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and contains proper spelling and word usage.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Beatrice ha un'attenzione per Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax rules for forming a sentence with a subject ("Beatrice"), verb ("ha", which agrees in number and person with the subject), direct object ("un'attenzione") and preposition ("per") followed by an indirect object ("Giulia").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alice è in ansia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing a subject ("Alice") and its state or action ("è in ansia", meaning "is anxious").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Siamo cariche di viveri" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "We are loaded with supplies."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La ragazza mangerà la pizza." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The girl will eat the pizza."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "She introduced the woman to some of her friends." is grammatically correct in English as it follows proper subject-verb agreement, word order, and contains all necessary elements for a complete thought.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Edoardo obbedisce a Sofia." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all words agree with each other in gender and number. In particular, "Edoardo" is masculine singular, "obbedisce" is third person singular conjugated from the verb "obbedire", and "Sofia" is feminine singular. Therefore, they match correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I am learning Italian" is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb-object structure in English. The subject "I" matches with the verb "am learning". Additionally, the tense is appropriate for present continuous actions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Una volta comprato il costume, Edoardo andrà a nuotare." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Once he buys the swimsuit, Edoardo will go swimming."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Edoardo va a invitare Giulia a cena." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all words agree with each other in number and gender.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject "Beatrice" does not agree with the verb form "le scappa". Also, there seems to be a missing word indicating what it is that Beatrice is running out to buy.	La ragazza, Beatrice, le scappa di comprare il pane. (Explainer note: "La ragazza" refers back to "Beatrice", making the agreement between them clearer; also, now we know she's running out to buy bread.)
1	The sentence "Sono i libri che Leonardo mette sugli scaffali ora." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It is the books that Leonardo is putting on the shelves now."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Edoardo mette i libri sugli scaffali" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure with proper verb conjugation for the third person singular masculine form ("mette"). It also uses the plural definite article "i" before the noun "libri", which agrees in gender and number with the following word. Lastly, "sugli" is correctly used here since it corresponds to the masculine plural form required by the noun "scaffali". Overall, there seem to be no grammatical issues within the provided sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. It should be "Leonardo mette quei libri sugli scaffali ora." ("Leonardo is putting those books on the shelves now.")	The sentence should be: "Leonardo mette quei libri sugli scaffali ora."
0	The subject "Andrea" does not agree with the verb "mangiano". It should be "mangia" because "Andrea" is singular.	Andrea mangia.
1	The sentence "Questo lavoro è di competenza di Leonardo." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It uses the third person singular form of the verb "essere" which agrees with the subject "lavoro". Also, the preposition "di" followed by "competenza" correctly indicates possession. Lastly, the name "Leonardo" at the end of the sentence is in the correct case for this context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is a grammatically correct Italian sentence. "Questo" means "this", "lavoro" means "job" or "work", "rientra" means "falls within" or "belongs to", "le competenze" means "the skills", and "di Riccardo" means "of Riccardo". So, the sentence can be translated as "This work falls within Riccardo's skills."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "A Francesco piace Maria per le sue gambe." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. It means "Francesco likes Maria for her legs."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea accarezza le gambe di Maria." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows subject-verb-object word order and all words agree with each other in gender and number.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non gradì quell'allusione." follows proper Italian grammar rules for conjugating verbs in the past tense and using singular masculine definite articles with nouns.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Francesco ricorda qualcosa" follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian, where "Francesco" serves as the subject, "ricorda" functions as the verb in its third person singular form, agreeing with the subject, and "qualcosa" represents the object. Therefore, it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Era la conversazione che fecero i due ragazzi che Paola criticò." follows the rules of Italian grammar. It uses the past tense correctly and all verb conjugations agree with their respective subjects.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leggeva i nomi degli artisti alla ragazza." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He was reading the names of artists to the girl."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ha tradito la fiducia di Gabriele" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax rules and all words are spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Era felice de ciò" follows the standard structure for Italian verb conjugations in the past tense. "Era" serves as the auxiliary verb while "felice" functions as the past participle. Therefore, there is no need for correction regarding grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Era contento de jugar a cartas." is grammatically correct because it follows the proper conjugation for the past tense of the verb in both Spanish ("jugar") and Italian ("era").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro disgusts Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. The subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "disgusts" in number (both singular), and the object "Giulia" correctly receives the action expressed by the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "vediamo" does not agree in number with its subject "ne." It should be "veniamo di tutte le type" if referring to many types. If it refers to one type only, then it would be fine as is. However, without additional context I am assuming that multiple types were intended.	Non so se ne veniamo di tutte le tipo. (If referring to many types.)
0	The verb "ha abboccato" does not agree with the subject "Lei". Also, there seems to be no direct object in this sentence which is required for the verb "abboccare" to make sense. A more appropriate form would be "Ha mangiato l'esca."	Lei ha mangiato l'esca.
0	The verb "ho" needs to agree with its subject in number and person, so it should be "ho" for first person singular, but here it seems that there is an object ("ore") after the verb, which requires the use of passato remoto tense in formal Italian writing. In informal spoken language, people often use present perfect where past simple would be more appropriate. However, even in this case, we need to add reflexive pronoun before the verb, so it will be "mi sono ridotto".	Mi sono ridotto a ho riso due ore. (Note: This corrected version might still sound strange because of mixing different tenses and styles. A better way to say it could be "Mi sono messo a ridere per due ore", meaning "I ended up laughing for two hours.")
0	The verb "have" must agree with its subject in number, so it should be "has" since the subject "she" is singular.	She has taken a crush on Sophia.

1	The sentence "Francesco guarda che tutto proceda per il meglio." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Francisco makes sure everything goes well" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in "Francesco si vergogna **sia** succeso". It should be "Francesco si vergogna **che sia** successo." because "si vergognare" requires a subjunctive verb form after "che", and since "essere" follows "sia", it must agree with its singular subject "succeso".	Francesco si vergogna che sia successo.
1	The sentence "Giulia deve lavorare domani." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows proper subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense usage. "Giulia" is the subject; "deve" is an auxiliary verb meaning "must"; "lavorare" means "to work," which is the infinitive form here following the auxiliary verb; and "domani" means "tomorrow". So, the translation is: "Giulia must work tomorrow."	The sentence is already correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct with all words spelled correctly and appropriate use of grammar rules in Italian language. The subject-verb agreement is also observed where "Francesco" which is singular agrees with its verb "stabilì".	The sentence is already correct.

0	The verb "hanno" agrees with its subject in number and person, but the problem here is related to word order. In Italian, questions can be formed by simply changing the intonation at the end of the sentence when speaking; however, when writing, it is necessary to add an interrogative particle such as "?" or use a different word order. Here, you could say "Hanno tutti messo in allarme?" or "Tutti hanno messo in allarme?" for better grammaticality.	Tutti han messo in allarme? OR Han tutti posto in allarme?
1	The sentence "Gli monta il sangue alla testa molto facilmente" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "His blood rises to his head very easily".	The sentence is already correct. ---
0	The verb "ha" should agree with its subject in number and gender. In this case, the subject "per tutta la vita" is singular feminine, so the verb should be "ha costruita".	Per tutta la vita ha costruita castelli in aria.
0	The verb "frutta" does not agree with its subject "terreno". It should be in plural form ("fruttano") because "terreno" is a masculine singular noun referring to an area of land which requires a plural verb for third person agreement.	Quel terreno fruttano molti soldi.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha fatto scrivere una lettera a Lorenzo da Riccardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In this sentence, "Gabriele" (subject) made "Lorenzo" (indirect object) write "una lettera" (direct object) with help from "Riccardo." It uses the auxiliary verb "ha fatto," which agrees with the subject in number and gender. Also, the preposition "da" indicates the person who performed the action on behalf of someone else.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject "Il vento" (the wind) does not agree with the verb "ha rotto" (has broken). It should be "ha fatto rompere", which means "made break". Also, there should be no space before the punctuation mark.	Il vento ha fatto rompere il vetro da Andrea.
0	The verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "il colonnello". It should be in singular form "ha fatto" for masculine subjects, but since "colonnello" is grammatically masculine plural, the correct verb would be "hanno fatto".	Il colonelli hanno fatto la nave.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo si è fatto rompere la vetrata." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and past participle concordance.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il sasso ha rotto il vetro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The rock broke the glass" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "L'auto ha schiacciato l'acceleratore" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for the gender and number agreement between the subject ("l'auto") and the verb ("schiacciato").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ha" should agree in number with its subject, so it should be changed to "hanno". Also, there should be a word separating "colpo" and "schiacciato", such as "il" or "un".	Il colpo ha schiacciato l'acceleratore. would be corrected as: I colpi hanno schiacciato l'acceleratore.

1	The sentence "Gabriele ha fatto ossidare il ferro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian, with all words agreeing in number and tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il vetro fu rotto dall'esplosione di un colpo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The glass was broken by the explosion of a shot."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" should agree in number with its subject, so it must be "does" when used with he/she/it as the subject. Also, we use "don't" for negations but only with plural nouns or singular nouns that refer to people. So here, the right form would be "She doesn't like spinach".	She doesn't like spinach.
1	The sentence "Paola ha trascurato se stessa." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order, with proper agreement between the subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "I prati si sono rivestiti con i fiori" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "the meadows have covered themselves with flowers".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I prezzi sono aumentati del 10 %." is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In particular, it uses the plural form of the third person pronoun ("sono" instead of "è") because it refers to multiple prices ("prezzi"). It also correctly employs the past participle ("aumentati") with an auxiliary verb in the appropriate tense and number. Additionally, the percentage value is expressed using figures followed by the symbol "%", which is common practice in many languages including Italian.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il fatturato si è incrementato del 15 % nell'ultimo anno." is grammatically correct. It follows all the rules of Italian grammar, including verb conjugation, word order, and agreement in gender and number.	The sentence is already correct.

The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il contagio è in diffusione." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In particular, the verb "essere" agrees with its subject "il contagio," and the preposition "in" followed by the article "la" before the gerund form "diffondendo" would indicate where the spreading is taking place. However, since the latter part is missing, I assume you wanted to say something about the location of the spread, so I will provide an alternative complete version below.	The sentence is almost correct; however, for clarity, let me suggest adding information on where the diffusion takes place: "Il contagio è in diffusione nella popolazione locale."
0	The verb "impel" does not mean what the speaker seems to intend in this context; it means something more like "to urge on". Instead, I believe you want to use the verb "shed", which in Italian is "perdere". Also, there needs to be a preposition between "di" and "peli".	Il gatto ha perso dei peli sul divano.
1	The sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English and all words seem to be spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "L'esplosione ha spaccato la vetrata per un secondo" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules for word order in Italian. It means "The explosion shattered the window for a second."	The sentence is already correct.

0	The verb "carburare" cannot be used with the subject "le vittorie" because it means "to carburete", which doesn't make sense when talking about victories. A more appropriate verb could be "motivated". Also, there is no need for an article before "una settimana".	Le vittorie hanno motivato il calciatore nella settimana.
1	The sentence "Il lievito ha fermentato la pasta in due ore." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax rules and all words used are correctly spelled and inflected for number and gender where necessary.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Il treno ha ritardato per due ore" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The train has been delayed for two hours."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "diventare" needs to agree in number with its subject, so it should be "sono diventati" because "il vino" is plural in this context.	Il vino sono diventati aceti per ore.
0	In Italian, adverbs usually come before the verb they modify, so "per anni" should go before "hanno incrementato". Also, there shouldn't be a space between the number and the percentage symbol in Italian.	I commercianti hanno incrementato del 10% le vendite per anni.
1	The sentence "Le vendite sono incrementate del 10 % in due anni." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. The subject-verb agreement is correct as well as the use of the past tense. Also, the percentage sign is used correctly after a numeral.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the rules of Italian grammar and syntax, with the subject-verb agreement being correct and all words spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.

All words are spelled correctly as well.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La finestra si è chiusa, ma non è chiusa." is grammatically correct because it uses the past participle form "si è chiusa" correctly with the auxiliary verb "è" in the first part of the sentence, and the present tense "non è chiusa" in the second part of the sentence. This construction emphasizes the contrast between the window being closed now ("non è chiusa") and having been closed before ("si è chiusa").	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "Il mare si è fatto agitato." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard rules for word order and verb conjugation. In this case, "il mare" is the subject, "si" is a reflexive pronoun used with impersonal verbs, and "è fatto agitato" is the third person singular form of the passive voice of the verb "fare," which means "to make" or "to become." So overall, the translation would be something like "The sea has made itself rough."	The sentence is already correct.

1	The word "ingarbugliatissima" follows regular Italian grammar rules for creating adverbs by adding "-mente" to an adjective. In this case, the adjective "ingarbugliato" is turned into an adverb through the addition of "-mente", which is used to modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs in order to indicate degree or manner. Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence is a correct complex sentence in Italian. It consists of an independent clause "A Riccardo" ("to Richard") and a dependent clause "questi argomenti non l'hanno convinto" ("these arguments did not convince him").

1	The sentence "Qu" before a vowel makes a /k/ sound in Italian, so it is pronounced correctly as "Quei". Also, stress falls on the second syllable of "innervosito", which is also correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ha fatto" agrees with a singular subject, but there are two objects ("Andrea" and "quell'uomo") after it. It should either be "hanno fatto" or one object should be changed into a reflexive form.	Alice ha fatto calmare André da sé stesso / da quell'uomo. OR Alice e Bob hanno fatto calmare Andrea / quell'uomo.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Maria" is singular, so the verb should also be singular. It should be "ha reso preoccupato", not "hanno reso preoccupati".	Maria ha reso preoccupato Gabriele dalla fidanzata. (or alternatively: "Le hanno rese preoccupate Gabriele dalla fidanzata.")
1	The verb "ha" agrees with the subject "Maria", indicating third person singular past tense, which is appropriate for the action described in the sentence. The direct object "Leonardo" follows standard Italian grammar rules by being placed after the indirect object "irretito".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" shouldn't be used with negative forms in present simple tense. Also, "likes" should agree with the subject "she", so it should be "like".	She doesn't like spinach.
0	The verb "si è piaciuto" needs to agree in number with its subject, so it should be "sono piaciuti". Also, there should be a preposition before "ciò".	Lorenzo sono piaciuti per quello.

1	The sentence "Riccardo è irritato di quella notizia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian and all words used are spelled correctly. Additionally, the verb tense ("è") agrees with the subject ("Riccardo").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Il fatto" requires a singular verb form, but "si abbasseranno" is plural.	Il fatto che la tassa si abbassi illude i cittadini.
1	The sentence "Maria has fear of that" is grammatically correct in English with minor modifications for verb tense agreement between the subject and predicate. A more natural way to say it would be "Maria fears that."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "fa" does not agree with its subject "ciò". It should be "fa" if the subject is singular, but in this case it should be plural because "ciò" refers to multiple things.	Questo la spaventa a Maria. (This scares her.)

1	The sentence "Quelle parole hanno offeso Francesco." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of a subject ("quelle parole" - those words), a verb in past tense ("hanno offeso" - they have offended), and an object ("Francesco" - Francesco). All the elements are correctly conjugated and placed within the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence "L'intonaco si è sgretolated" is grammatically correct, but there seems to be a typo in the past participle form of the verb "sgretolare". It should be "sgretolato", with an "a" at the end, rather than "sgretolated". This could just be a spelling mistake made when transcribing the word into English characters.	The sentence is already correct.

0	The verb "ti" should agree with its subject in number and person. Here it should be "tieni" instead of "tiENI". Also, there should be a comma after "raccomando" for better readability.	Mi raccomando, tieni aqua in bocca.
1	The sentence "Il bambino piange" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The child cries".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo perde il cappello" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo loses his hat".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo avrebbe bruciato le tapes" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of a subject ("Riccardo"), a conjugated verb in conditional tense ("avrebbe bruciato") which means "would have burned", and an object ("le tapes"). However, since "tape" in English becomes "nastro" or "cassetta" in Italian depending on its meaning, I assume there might be some confusion about the word choice here.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria ha rubato improvvisamente il cuore a Gabriele" is grammatically correct as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian with proper verb conjugation for the third person singular feminine form ("ha rubato") and appropriate use of word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Emma se la passava bene" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Emma was having a good time."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Giulia mise gli occhi addosso a Lorenzo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar in terms of word order, verb conjugation, and agreement between subject and object.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo abbandonò l'abito sul divano." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure with proper agreement between the subject and verb tense. It translates to "Riccardo abandoned the suit on the couch" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria inclined her head." is grammatically correct in English as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense for past action with appropriate vocabulary and spelling.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alice piegò la testa" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alice bowed her head".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria lifted her head." is grammatically correct in English because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order. The subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "lifted" in number and tense, and the adverbial phrase "her head" correctly modifies the action described by the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria rizzò il capo" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order, uses proper conjugation for the past tense, and includes appropriate punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele prese l'auto." follows the standard structure for expressing an action in Italian with a subject-verb-object order. Here, "Gabriele" is the subject, "prese" is the past tense form of the verb "prendere", which means "to take", and "l'auto" is the object being taken. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "trombosi" is a noun in its plural form, but it needs to be singular ("trombosis") because it follows the verb "prese", which requires a direct object in the third person singular form.	Alessandro prese la tromboisi.
0	The past tense verb "venne" does not agree with its subject "la trombosi". Also, there should be an article before "Edoardo".	La trombosi gli venne ad Edoardo. ("gli" is used as a indirect object pronoun referring to "Edoardo")
0	The verb "venne" does not agree with its subject "il tifo". In this case, it should be in the third-person plural form, which is "venero".	Il tifo vennero a Riccardo. (or more commonly: Il tifo è arrivato a Riccardo.)
0	The verb "sich" does not exist in Italian language. Also, there is no third person singular indicative imperfect form for the verb "scaldare", it would have been "si scaldava". Moreover, the pronoun "he" can be translated as "egli" but it's usually omitted because subject-verb agreement makes its presence unnecessary. In this case, since we know that the subject is masculine singular ("Leonardo"), the verb must agree with it by using "-a" ending. Therefore, the correct form is "si scaldava".	Leonardo si scaldava.
1	The sentence "Maria si riposó" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for conjugating the Italian verb "riposare" in the past tense for feminine singular subjects ("si riposa", "si riposai", "si riposó"). In this case, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun and "riposó" is the third person singular form of the past definite tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alice si rinforzò" follows the standard rules for conjugating the Italian verb "rinforzare" in its past tense form ("passato remoto") for third person singular feminine subject "Alice". Therefore it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The subject "Paola e Francesco" is correctly using the plural form "presero", which matches with the verb tense used in the sentence. The sentence does not have any grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ebbe una sbornia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo had a hangover".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "fare" requires an object in this context, so the sentence needs to include what it was that the cheese did (e.g., "Il formaggio fece **il buco**").	The sentence is incorrect; a possible correction could be: "Il formaggio marcì."
1	The sentence "Sofia ebbe un bagno" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sofia had a bath".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Beatrice si maritò con Gabriele." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It uses proper verb conjugation for the past tense, appropriate word order, and there are no spelling errors in the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo respirirò aria fresca" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo will breathe fresh air."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Giulia prese una dritta" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian word order and uses proper conjugations for the past tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we use "does" instead of "do" with he/she/it in present simple tense for third person singular subjects when forming a question. Also, the verb after "he/she/it" takes its base form, so it should be "likes", not "likes+s". Therefore, the correct version would be "She doesn't like apples."	The sentence should be "She doesn't like apples."
0	The verb "approdare" needs to agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, since the subject is "l'aereo", which is singular and masculine, the verb must also be singular and masculine. Therefore, it should be "approdò" rather than "approdarono".	L'aereo approdò.
1	The sentence "Alessandro si bagnò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro took a bath".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso arieggiò la sua stanza" follows proper Italian grammar rules for conjugating verbs and using pronouns. It uses the past tense form of the verb "areggiare," which means "to air out." The subject of the sentence is "Tommaso," who is performing the action on his own room, "la sua stanza." Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La nave ammarò" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the rules for word order, tense agreement, and subject-verb agreement. It can be translated to English as "The ship ran aground."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso prese la terra dal secchio." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all words agree with each other in number and gender.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I marinai vogavano" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The sailors were rowing."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il dollaro è salito" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax and spelling rules. It can be translated as "The dollar has risen."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il progetto ebbe successo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The project was successful."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo prese un cappellaccio" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure with proper verb conjugation for the past tense.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" should be used with he/she/it in the present simple tense in negative and question forms, but not in affirmative sentences. In the third person singular form, we add an -s to the base form of the verb in present simple tense. So, the correct sentence is "She doesn't like spinach."	She doesn't like spinach.
1	The sentence "Andrea prese cappello." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea picked up a hat" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "prese" does not agree with the subject "Paola". It should be "prese il suo corpo" or simply "lei prese il corpo" for grammatical correctness.	Paola prese il suo corpo.
1	The subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "prese", both in number (singular) and person (third). Also, the past tense is used correctly. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The verb "annotò" agrees in number and tense with its subject "Francesco," so the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Leonardo prese imbarco sulla nave" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an action in the past tense using a regular verb ("prendere") with its corresponding auxiliary verb ("avere"). In addition, all words used are spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola prese informazioni su Alessandro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola looked for information about Alessandro."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Edoardo si innamorò di Sofia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo fell in love with Sofia" and follows proper subject-verb agreement and word order rules for Italian sentences.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "odio" means "hatred" in Italian, so it cannot be used as a noun meaning "a type of bean." A better translation for "Paola picked some beans for Tommaso" would be "Paola raccolse dei fagioli per Tommaso."	Paola raccolse dei fagioli per Tommaso.
1	The verb "si imbeccarono" agrees in number with its subject "gli uccelli," so the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria took a crush on Francesco" is grammatically correct in English. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate tense for expressing an action completed in the past.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the subject-verb-object structure in Italian and all words used are grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo è il primo nella gara." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian and all words used are spelled correctly. Additionally, gender agreement between adjectives and nouns as well as verb conjugations match with the intended meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "prese" does not agree with its subject "Francesco". It should be "prese" if it refers to only one person in the past tense, but since "Francesco" is masculine singular, the agreement must be made accordingly.	Francesco prese il coltello per il manico.
1	The sentence "Leonardo fece il proprio danno" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo caused his own damage."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha preso fischi per fiaschi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo made mistakes".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria fece una seduta di elioterapia." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the rules for word order and verb conjugation in Italian. In particular, the past tense form "fece" agrees with the subject "Maria", and the article "una" precedes the noun "seduta". Furthermore, the preposition "di" introduces the gerund form "elioterapia", which functions as an adverbial modifier specifying the type of session.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea prese il treno" is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard structure for past tense sentences in Italian. In this case, "Andrea" is the subject, "prese" is the conjugated verb meaning "took", and "il treno" means "the train".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error related to agreement between subject and verb tense. "Sono stato" would be more appropriate than "è stato". Also, there should be a comma after "treno."	Sono stato troppo spesso perdendo questo treno, in questa redazione.
1	The sentence "La bussola fu persa da Gabriele." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The compass was lost by Gabriele."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows standard English grammar rules for word order and tense agreement between subject and verb. It also uses appropriate punctuation marks at the end of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The comparison in the sentence should be made using "than" followed by a subject and its verb rather than just pronoun ("me"). Also, there shouldn't be any article before "well". So it should be "she cooks better than I do" or "she cooks more nicely than I do".	She cooks better than I do.
1	The sentence "Tommaso mise giudizio" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. "Mise" is the past tense of the verb "mettere" which means "to put," and "giudizio" means "judgment." So, the sentence can be translated as "Tommaso made a judgment."	The sentence is already correct.
0	In the sentence "Lorenzo ne disse due a Maria", there is no context provided for the use of "ne" and "due". The sentence seems incomplete and confusing as it is unclear what Lorenzo said two of to Maria.	A correct sentence could be "Lorenzo diede due mele a Maria" which means "Lorenzo gave two apples to Maria."
1	The sentence "Beatrice prese fischi per fiaschi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Beatrice took claps for flasks", which means she failed miserably despite high expectations.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "butta" does not agree with its subject "Tommaso". It should be "getta" in the third person singular form. Also, there should be an accent on the word "olio", making it "olió".	Tommaso getta olió sul fuoco. (or more naturally: Tommaso versa olio sul fuoco.)
1	The sentence "Riccardo tirò l'acqua al proprio mulino" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for the past tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro si diede la zappa sui piedi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro shot himself in the foot."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Emma ascolta un disco." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax and grammar rules for forming a simple sentence with a subject ("Emma"), verb ("ascolta" - listens), and direct object ("un disco" - a record).	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha toccato Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian with proper verb conjugation for the third person singular masculine form ("ha toccato").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo fa le traduzioni dei bollettini di guerra" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for a sentence in Italian with a subject ("Riccardo"), verb ("fa") and object ("le traduzioni dei bollettini di guerra").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. It should be "di te **ridono** in maniera beffarda" since "te" indicates plural subjects.	Di te ridono in maniera beffarda. (Note: I am assuming that you meant "ridono" instead of "ride". If it was intended to be written as "ride", please let me know.)
1	The sentence "Tommaso legge." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement in Italian where the singular masculine third person present tense verb form "legge" agrees with its singular male subject "Tommaso".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele fa una telefonata a Maria." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele is making a phone call to Maria".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso dà un libro a Maria." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for each noun based on their gender and number. In this case, "Tommaso" is masculine singular, so the verb "dà" agrees with it. Similarly, "libro" is masculine singular, and "Maria" is feminine singular, which match with "un" and "a," respectively.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence uses the subjunctive mood correctly in both instances where it is called for - "che Andrea **abbia** telefonato" and "Giulia **sia** ritornata". This tense is used here because the speaker is expressing uncertainty about whether Andrea actually made the phone call, and also about Giulia having returned. Therefore, no correction needs to be applied.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo telefona ad Emma" is grammatically correct because it follows the Subject-Verb-Object structure in Italian with proper spelling and word choice.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Emma è in angoscia" follows the standard structure for expressing location in Italian, with the subject ("Emma") followed by the verb "essere" (to be) in third person singular form ("è"), and ending with the preposition "in" plus the location ("angoscia"). Therefore, it is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "do" should agree with the subject in number, so it should be "does" when used with he, she, or it. Also, we use "don't" for negations with he, she, or it, but here there is no negation.	"She doesn't like him."
1	The sentence "Leonardo doesn't likes Paola." contains two grammatical errors. Firstly, the verb "doesn't" must agree with the subject in number, so it should be "doesn't like" since the subject "Leonardo" is singular. Secondly, the word "likes" must be spelled without an "s" at the end because "Leonardo" is a singular noun.	The sentence is already correct after changing "doesn't likes" to "doesn't like".
1	The sentence "Alessandro andò a salutare il padre." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro went to greet his father".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject "Alessandro" is singular, so we need to use the singular form of the verb "girare", which is "gira". Also, there needs to be a comma after "raccoglierla".	Alessandro girò, con l'auto, a raccoglierla, per portarla a casa sua.
1	The sentence "Il battello virò a salvarli." is grammatically correct because all words are spelled correctly, there is a clear subject ("il battello") and verb agreement ("virò" in third person singular form agrees with "il battello"), and the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea obeys him always." is grammatically correct in English. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object structure with proper tense agreement between the subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I soldati hanno passato le armi ai prigionieri." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The soldiers handed over the weapons to the prisoners."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ama i bignè." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro loves cream puffs" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Il cedro ama la libertà." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of a subject ("il cedro"), which is a masculine singular noun; a verb ("ama"), which is in the third person singular present tense form agreeing with the subject; and an object ("la libertà"), which is a feminine singular noun. All the words have the correct gender and number agreement, and they follow each other in the right order. Therefore, there is no need for any correction.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ha potato" is incorrect. It should be "ha potuto", which means "was able to". Also, "barboncino" is a masculine noun so it should be "il suo barboncino" instead of "di Edoardo".	Il giardiniere ha potuto il suo barboncino.
0	The pronoun "gli" is in the wrong place and it should come before "Alessandro". Also, there shouldn't be a comma after "Alessandro".	A Lorenzo, Alessandro ha lasciato una ricca eredità gli.
1	The sentence "Alessandro beve il suo caffè." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro drinks his coffee".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro desidera rivedere Beatrice." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar, including word order, tense agreement, subject-verb agreement, and spelling. It can be translated as "Alessandro wants to see Beatrice again" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Un gatto con gli occhi gialli sta sotto l'arco della porta" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In English, this translates to "A cat with yellow eyes is under the arch of the door."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola ha coraggio." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order for a simple declarative statement. In this case, "Paola" is the subject, "ha" is the verb, and "coraggio" is the object. Additionally, each word is spelled correctly and there are no missing or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele segue una rigida condotta morale." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele follows a strict moral conduct" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La zanzara pratica una rigida condotta morale." is grammatically correct as it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of a subject ("la zanzara" meaning "the mosquito"), a verb in third person singular present tense ("pratica" meaning "practices"), an adjective agreeing with the noun it modifies ("rigida" meaning "strict") and another noun acting as the object of the preposition "di" ("condotta morale" meaning "moral conduct"). All words follow their proper inflections and agreement rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "il frigorifero". It should be "hanno" because "frigorifero" is plural in this context. Also, there shouldn't be a space before the opening parenthesis.	Il frigorifero ha una forte cottura per Francesco. (without the space before the opening parenthesis)
0	The verb "dette" does not agree in number with its subject "Tommaso". It should be "diede" instead.	Tommaso diede dei schiaffi a Maria.
1	The sentence "Riccardo allungò uno schiaffo a Giulia." is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the rules for word order and verb conjugation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo resta in silenzio." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence where the subject comes first followed by the verb and its complements. In this case, "Riccardo" is the subject, "resta" is the verb in third person singular form, and "in silenzio" is the complement indicating where Riccardo remains.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows all grammar rules in English language. It consists of two independent clauses ("Riccardo does not have any suspicions" and "Emma is honest") connected by the coordinating conjunction "but". Both subjects and verbs agree with each other in number, making it grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo riceve aiuto da Edoardo." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax rules and all words used in the sentence are correctly spelled.	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we don't say "agitas" but rather "agitates". Also, there needs to be a subject in the sentence for it to make sense.	The sentence is already correct if you meant "Alessandro agitates Beatrice."
1	The sentence "Edoardo fa friggere l'uovo nella padella" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb conjugations for the third person singular masculine (fa) and the present tense (friggere).	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo procede al caricamento del camion di casse." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo proceeds with loading the truck with crates".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "L'inchiostro rosso è la carica della stilografica." is grammatically correct as it follows the rules for Italian grammar. It consists of a subject ("l'inchiostro rosso" meaning red ink), a verb in third person singular form ("è" which means is), and an object ("la carica della stilografica" referring to the charge of the fountain pen). All words are correctly spelled and agree with each other in gender and number.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La stilografica è caricada" is grammatically correct with the exception of one minor typographical error in the final word. It appears as though it should read "caricata", rather than "caricada". This would indicate that the fountain pen is loaded or ready for use.	La stilografica è caricata.
1	The sentence "Tommaso fruga nei cassetti della scrivania di Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and grammar. Each word is spelled correctly and there are no missing words or extra words.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "carica" does not agree with the subject "Andrea". "Carica" is an third-person singular form while "Andrea" is first-person singular. It should be "carico" instead.	Andrea carico l'orologio.
0	The verb "dà" does not agree with the subject "Riccardo". It should be "da". Also, there shouldn't be a space before the period.	Riccardo da molte botte al cane.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo salge, per una seconda volta, le scale di corsa." is grammatically correct. It means "Lorenzo runs up, for the second time, the stairs".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Beatrice ha l'incarico di rapire Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for each subject.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "corre" does not agree with its subject "Alessandro". In singular, third person, masculine form, the present tense of "correre" (to run) is "corre", but when used with a male singular subject such as "Alessandro", it should be "corre". Therefore, the sentence should be "Alessandro corre **l'**asino."	Alessandro corre **l'**asino.
1	The sentence "Francesco prende il cervo per le corna e lo atterra" is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object order and uses proper verb forms for regular verbs ("prende", "atterra") and nouns ("il cervo"). Also, prepositions match with their corresponding articles and agreement between adjective and noun is respected as well.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "il frigo." It should be "È" because "frigo" is singular and masculine. Also, there is no such action as "seducing" for an inanimate object like a refrigerator towards another animal like a cat. Therefore, it doesn't make sense semantically.	The sentence is incorrect. A possible grammatically correct alternative could be: "Il gatto si è avvicinato al frigo." which means "The cat approached the fridge."
0	Inanimate objects such as "fridge" cannot have feelings or actions like "seduce". This leads to an illogical statement in English as well as in Italian.	The sentence is already correct in terms of grammar but it lacks sense and logic; thus, I would suggest changing the sentence. For instance: "Il ragazzo ha spostato la sedia." (The boy moved the chair.)
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Riccardo" is singular, so it requires a singular verb form. However, "ha" is the third person plural form of "to have," which does not agree with the singular subject "Riccardo." Instead, the sentence should use the third person singular form "has."	Riccardo has seduced a minor.
1	The sentence "Tutta la sala applaudì all'affermazione dell'oratore." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for the given context.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola ha letto un libro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola read a book.", where "ha" is an auxiliary verb used with the past participle "letto", which agrees in gender and number with the direct object "libro". In English, it would require the use of a helping verb ("has") along with the past tense form of the main verb ("read").	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "colleziona" needs to agree with its subject in number and gender. In this case, the subject "Maria" is feminine singular, so the verb must also be feminine singular. However, "collezionano" is plural and masculine, which does not match the subject.	Maria colleziona biglietti d'amore.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha tosato lo zio." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo has shaved his uncle" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola fa una corsa in giardino" is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. In this sentence, "Paola" is the subject who performs an action denoted by the verb "faithfully give to our pets. This action is expressed through the third person singular form of the verb "fare," which is "fa." Then we have "una corsa" - a run, with "una" being used as a determiner for countable nouns. Finally, there is the preposition "in" followed by "giardino", meaning garden or yard. So overall, this sentence means "Paola goes for a run in the garden".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo scambia libri con Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. It contains a proper subject ("Riccardo"), verb ("scambia") and object ("libri"). Moreover, it uses the preposition "con" correctly to indicate that Riccardo is exchanging books with Maria.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alice ha curvato la fronte." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alice has furrowed her brow" in English.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "ha" should agree with its subject in number and gender. In this case, the subject "Maria" is feminine singular, so the verb should also be conjugated in the third person singular feminine form. The correct form of the verb would be "ha curva**to**".	Maria ha curvat**o** la faccia.
1	The sentence "Sofia maintains head at enemy" is grammatically correct but it doesn't make sense in English as it uses an literal translation from another language. It would be more appropriate to say "Sofia confronts her enemy."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Alessandro" is singular, so the verb should also be singular. The correct form of the verb "gonfiare" for a male singular subject is "si gonfia", not "si gonfiano".	Alessandro si gonfia la testa.
1	The sentence "Beatrice ha piantato in asso Giulia" follows the standard structure for expressing an action performed by a subject on an object in Italian language. Here, "Beatrice" is the subject who performs the action expressed by the verb "ha piantato", while "in asso" describes how she did it and "Giulia" is the object receiving the action. Therefore, I would say that the sentence is grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject in the sentence is missing. It should start with "Capire" changed to "Noi capiamo". Also, there should be an article before "intenzioni."	Noi capiamo le intenzioni segrete di una persona.
1	The sentence "Maria changes the cards" is grammatically correct in English as it follows standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense for the action being performed.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "fa" should agree in number with its subject "Riccardo", which is singular. Therefore, it should be "fa" and not "fan". Also, there is no such verb as "cattivo"; perhaps you meant "cattive" (plural form of "bad"), but even then, since "gioco" is a masculine noun, it would need to be "cattivo gioco" rather than "cattive." I assume you intended to say something different; please let me know what you had in mind so I can provide an accurate correction.	The sentence is not correct and needs further clarification before I can suggest a revision.
0	The verb "ha" should agree in number with its subject, so it should be "hanno". Also, there shouldn't be a space before punctuation marks.	Andrea hanno rotto il collo a Beatrice. (Note: I assumed you meant "Andrea have broken Beatrice's neck." If the intended meaning is different, please let me know.)
0	The verb "rompe" does not agree with its subject "la musica." In Italian, when the subject is feminine singular, the verb must end in -a in present tense.	La musica rock si spezza le orecchie.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha dato quel che è di Tommaso a Tommaso" is grammatically correct because it follows proper Italian syntax rules for subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense consistency. It also uses appropriate articles and pronouns.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English, with proper tense usage and no apparent grammatical errors.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "andare" requires an object in this context, but none is provided. A possible completion for this sentence could be "Andare a casa." ("Go home.")	The sentence is not currently correct; it needs to include an object for the verb "andare". For example: "Vado a fare la spesa."
1	The sentence "Essere all'indice" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "to be on index" or "to be listed".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "mettere" requires an object in this context, but none is provided. Additionally, there seems to be a missing direct object pronoun before "all'indice". A possible correction could be "Mettiamoci all'indice." which means "Let's point it out."	The sentence would be correct as "Mettiamoci all'indice."
0	The verb "alzare" needs to agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, since the subject is "io", the verb should be "alzo".	Io alzo il gomito.
1	The sentence "Perdere il lume della ragione" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure for losing something. It literally translates to "Losing one's reason".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Cavare la castagne dal fuoco a qualcuno" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "to bail someone out."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The phrase "povero in canna" is not a grammatically correct way to say "poor" in Italian. A possible correct version could be "essere povero". However, without more context it's difficult to provide an exact translation.	The sentence is not correct, a corrected version could be "Essere povero."
1	The sentence "L'angelo custode accompagna la fantasia di ogni bambino." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper grammatical forms for each word according to their gender and number agreement rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Ogni bambino ha un angelo custode che lo protegge." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Every child has a guardian angel who protects him."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject "A quella festa" requires the verb to agree in number and gender, which is "è", but it should be "èsse" because "festa" is feminine singular.	La quella festa è d'obbligo lo smoking.
0	The word "nuota" should be "nuova", as it describes the state of the motorcycle being new rather than an action of swimming ("nuotare").	La moto di Leonardo è nuova di zecca. (Note: This means "Leonardo's motorcycle is brand new.")
1	The sentence "Ho visto un'unità in marcia." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In this sentence, "ho" is the first person singular present indicative form of the verb "avere," which means "to have"; "visto" is the past participle of "vedere," which means "to see"; "un'" is an article used before feminine words starting with a stressed vowel; "unità" means "unit" and is a feminine noun; "in" can mean "in" or "on" and here implies movement or location; "marcia" means "march" and agrees with "in". Therefore, the whole sentence translates as "I saw a unit on the march."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The subject-verb agreement is incorrect in this sentence. "Che Leonardo" is singular, so the verb must also be singular. However, "ritorni" is the third person singular form of "return," which does not match the plural subject "Leonardo." Instead, you should use the third person singular form of "please," which is "piaccia."	Che Leonardo riENTI piaccia a Maria.
1	The sentence "Sofia runs to eat." is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a proper subject ("Sofia"), a verb in the third person present tense ("runs"), and an infinitive phrase acting as the object of the sentence ("to eat"). All elements agree with each other, making it a grammatically acceptable sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea smiles at Sofia" follows standard English grammar rules for subject-verb agreement and word order.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Beatrice bada a che l'articolo sia chiaro" follows proper Italian grammar rules for word order, verb conjugations, and article usage. It can be translated as "Beatrice makes sure that the article is clear."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro divorzia da Paola." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure for expressing an action performed by a subject on an object with the verb "divorziare" (to divorce) being used correctly.	The sentence is already correct. Confidence level: 95%
1	The sentence "Riccardo abita in una casa piccola." is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Maria doesn't live in Rome" is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "doesn't live" agrees with its singular subject "Maria". It also uses proper capitalization and punctuation.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Mille stelle brillano nel cielo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Thousand stars shine in the sky".	The sentence is already correct. Confidence level: 95%
0	The verb "guardare" requires an object in its accusative form. A direct translation would result in "This watches that thing," which is clearly ungrammatical. Instead, you could say "Osserva quella cosa."	Osserva quella cosa.
0	The subject "Leonardo" requires an agreement with the verb in number and person, so it should be "studia**no***", not "studia".	Tutti i giorni, Leonardo **studiano** intensamente tre ore al giorno. (or "Tutti i giorni, Leonardo studia intensamente per tre ore al giorno." for better fluency)
1	The sentence "La parete è toccata dalle spalle di Riccardo" is grammatically correct because it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It uses proper word order, verb conjugation, and prepositions.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo tocca la schiena di Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian with proper conjugation for regular verbs in present tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Una tale conclusione deriva" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Such a conclusion follows".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mangia poca frutta." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele eats little fruit."	The sentence is already correct.
0	In English, we need to add an 's' at the end of the verb when it refers to a third person singular subject (he, she, it). Therefore, in this case, the verb 'drink' needs to change to 'drinks'.	The sentence should be: "Andrea drinks."
0	The verb "pizzica" does not mean what it seems to in English ("picks at") when used with "sadism." A more appropriate Italian word might be "tortura," which means "tortures." Also, there is no subject for the sentence, so we don't know who is doing the torturing. It would need to be clear from context or explicitly stated.	In questo contesto, la frase dovrebbe essere più simile a qualcosa del genere: "Il carnefice tortureggia con sadismo."
1	The sentence "Alessandro disegna sul muro" is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure. In this case, "Alessandro" is the subject, "disegna" is the verb meaning "draws," and "sul muro" means "on the wall." The word order is also appropriate for an affirmative statement with no emphasis on any particular part of the sentence.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo balla la rumba." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian. In this case, "Lorenzo" is the subject, "balla" is the verb, and "la rumba" is the object.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "dormita" is a feminine noun in Spanish, but in Italian it would be "un sonnellino". Also, the verb form used with "la siesta" should agree with its subject, which requires changing "è" to "e".	La siesta è un sonnellino.
1	The sentence "Francesco nuota a rana" is grammatically correct in Italian because it follows standard subject-verb-complement structure where "Francesco" is the subject, "nuota" is the verb which means "swims", and "a rana" is the complement describing how he swims ("like a frog").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The subject "la spugna" (the sponge) agrees with the verb "pulisce" (cleanses), both in number (singular) and person (third). Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian grammar rules.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb " Bevono" does not agree with its subject "Tutti". Also, in Italian, we use "tè" instead of "the".	Tutti bevono il tè amaro.
1	The sentence "I lavori fatti hanno reso più larga la piazza." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The completed works have made the square wider."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso afferra il gatto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso picks up the cat."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The subject-verb agreement is correct in this sentence. "Alessandro" is singular and masculine, and the verb "riflette" agrees with it in number and gender. The verb also correctly conjugates for third person singular in present tense.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea discusses the validity of Maria's statements" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of a proper subject ("Andrea"), a verb in the third person singular present tense ("discusses") and an object ("the validity of Maria's statements"). All elements follow standard English grammar rules.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb in number and person, which is "fotografa". This means that the sentence is grammatically correct from a subject-verb agreement standpoint. Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules where the subject comes before the verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso legge il giornale in salotto." follows all the rules of Italian grammar. It consists of a proper subject ("Tommaso"), verb ("legge"), direct object ("il giornale") and prepositional phrase ("in salotto"). All words agree with each other in number and gender. Also, there are no spelling errors and punctuation marks are used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha visto una casa di mattoni rossi." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele saw a red-brick house".	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha visto una casa." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian syntax rules for word order in declarative sentences (Subject-verb-object: Tommaso (subject)-ha visto (past tense of "see")-una casa (direct object)). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no missing punctuation marks.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I libri vecchi stanno nella cassa" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The old books are in the box."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "passare" requires an indirect object pronoun in addition to the direct object pronoun when both objects refer to people. In this case, "da Beatrice" indicates the original owner of the book, making it the indirect object, while "Francesco" is the new owner, making it the direct object. Therefore, the sentence needs the double object pronouns "gli" and "lo", respectively.	Un libro gli lo passa da Beatrice a Francesco.
0	The verb "c'è" does not agree with its subject "Maria". It should be "ci sono" because "Maria" is plural in this context.	Non ci sono sempre una concordanza in Maria tra i fatti e le parole.
1	The sentence "Maria puts the book in the bag" follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and all words seem to be used correctly.	The sentence is already correct.

1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct with all words used correctly and proper agreement between subject and verb.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Quella scatola conserva le foto di Alessandro ed Edoardo." is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian grammar rules for forming sentences with multiple subjects using "e" as a conjunction between them.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "E ciò è avvenuto al bar." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard subject-verb-location word order and uses proper verb conjugations for third person singular ("è") and masculine definite article ("al").	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Paola ha estratto la pistola e ciò ha avuto luogo dalla borsa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola pulled out the gun and that happened from her bag."	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "stare" requires the third person singular form in present tense which is "sta", but it appears as "stanno". This is an incorrect use of verbs in Italian language.	Il libro non sta nella cartelletta.
1	The sentence "La commessa avvolge la carta da regalo intorno alla bottiglia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The shop assistant wraps gift paper around the bottle".	The sentence is already correct.
0	The sentence contains an error in verb conjugation. "Ha" does not agree with its subject "Beatrice". It should be "È" instead, since it refers to the third person singular present tense of the verb "essere", which means "to be". In addition, there should be no space before the punctuation mark at the end of the sentence.	È dal marciapiede alla porta di casa che Beatrice ha piantati dei paletti.
1	The sentence "Maria gives burial to the father under a tree" is grammatically correct in English, despite being written in Italian characters. However, I assume you want me to evaluate it as an Italian sentence. In Italian, it would be "Maria da sepoltura al padre sotto un albero", which maintains the same grammatical structure and is also grammatically correct.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "La polizia sgombera la piazza dei dimostranti." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "L'architetto ha decorato la facciata di fregi in marmo." appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The architect decorated the facade with marble friezes."	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Andrea uccise Edoardo con un sol colpo di coltello." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrew killed Edward with one knife blow.", where "sol" is an old-fashioned way to say "one" in poetry and literature. Nowadays, it would be more common to use "un solo". However, both versions are acceptable.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The verb "stare" must agree in number with its subject, so it should be "stanno" instead of "sta". Also, articles in Italian need to match the gender and number of the noun they precede, so "il" should be used before "bagaglio" (singular masculine).	I bagagli non stanno nella auto.
1	The sentence "I libri stanno nella stanza" follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in Italian, with the plural noun "libri" agreeing with the third person plural present tense verb "stanno". Additionally, all words are spelled correctly.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "I vestiti vecchi stanno nell'armario" is grammatically correct in Italian with one minor exception - the word "armario" does not exist in standard Italian. It seems there might be a confusion between Spanish and Italian languages. In Italian, it would be "I vestiti vecchi stano nell'armadio." However, since you wrote "stanno", which is plural, we assume multiple old clothes are being referred to here, so the noun "vestiti" also needs to be plural. Therefore, let me adjust the original sentence slightly for consistency.	I vestiti vecchi stanno nell'armadio. (In English: The old clothes are in the closet.)
0	The verb "stare" agrees with the subject in number, so it should be "stanno" since "i vestiti" is plural. Also, there shouldn't be an article before "armadio".	I vestiti vecchi non stanno in armadio.
1	The sentence "Andrea profuma la stanza di aromi di pino" follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence where the subject comes first followed by the verb. In this case, "Andrea" is the subject, "profuma" is the verb, "la stanza" is the direct object and "di aromi di pino" describes what the room smells like. All words used in this sentence are correctly spelled and follow grammatical rules for word order and tense agreement.	The sentence is already correct.
0	The word "intasano" does not agree in number with its subject "cicche". It should be "intasa" since cicche is plural.	Cicche **intasano** lo scarico della fontana. -> **Ciche intasano gli scarichi della fontana.**
0	The word "disinfestanti" should agree in number with "acqua". Since "acqua" is singular, we need to use the singular form of "disinfestanti", which is "disinfestante".	Maria fa l'innaffiatura delle piante con acqua con disinfestante.
1	The sentence "Il radar ha localizzato l'aereo" is grammatically correct because it follows standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for the past tense ("ha localizzato") with the singular masculine noun "il radar." Additionally, "l'aereo" is correctly used as the direct object pronoun in agreement with its gender and number.	The sentence is already correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro difende Beatrice dai pericoli." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this sentence, the subject "Alessandro" performs the action "difendere" on the object "Beatrice," which is modified by the prepositional phrase "dai pericoli." This structure creates a clear and coherent meaning.	The sentence is already correct.
