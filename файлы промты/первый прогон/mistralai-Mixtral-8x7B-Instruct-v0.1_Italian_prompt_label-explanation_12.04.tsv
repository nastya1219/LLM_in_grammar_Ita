label	explanation
0	The verb "voglio" should be followed by the infinitive form of the next verb without adding "di". So instead of saying "Voglio di salutare", it should be "Voglio salutare".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible translation to English could be "I feel like saying hello to Sophia."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il mio preferito" means "my favorite," and it agrees with the singular noun "la Divina Commedia." So there are no errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "my favorite train" requires the verb to be in singular form, but instead it is used in plural form ("are"). Also, it doesn't make sense for a train to be "la Divina Commedia", which refers to Dante Alighieri's famous epic poem. A more appropriate way of phrasing this could be "My favorite type of train is the bullet train."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo said that Andrea spoke with Riccardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for past tense ("said", "spoke") to indicate reported speech.
0	The verb "are" should be changed to "is" because the subject "any book" is singular. Also, there shouldn't be a word "the" before "book" as it is already specified by "any". A correct version of this sentence would be: "They don't have any book on the shelf."
1	The sentence "Alessandro has met Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Alessandro"), a helping verb ("has") and a past participle verb form ("met"). Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "il padre" (the father) is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the singular verb "è" (is). This indicates that "il padre" refers to one person. Additionally, "del ragazzo" (of the boy) correctly describes the relationship between the father and the son.
1	The sentence "I prezzi sono aumentati" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. Here, the verb "sono" (which means "to be" in English) agrees with the plural noun "prezzi". Also, the past tense of the verb "aumentare" (meaning "to increase" or "to raise") should be used here to indicate that the price increase has already occurred. Hence, this sentence can also be written as "I prezzi sono stati aumentati," which still remains grammatically correct but sounds more formal than the original one due to the use of the passive voice.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "we" is "were", not "ci siamo dati". A grammatically correct version would be "Salvatore and I went wild."
1	The sentence "Il palazzo delle assicurazioni è crollato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "il palazzo" (the building) is singular and masculine, so we use the third person singular verb form "è." Additionally, the adjective "delle assicurazioni" correctly agrees with its noun in gender and number. Lastly, the clause follows the standard SVO structure (Subject-Verb-Object), where the subject ("palazzo") comes before the verb ("è").
0	The verb should agree with its subject in number and person. In this sentence, the subject "that construction" is singular, while the verb "offend" is plural. It should be "offends."
1	The sentence "Newton ha spiegato la forza di gravità." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha spiegato" (third person singular form of the verb "spiegare") agrees with its subject "Newton". Additionally, all other elements such as word order and tense are also appropriate.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Mi hanno dato il premio" can be translated to English as "They gave me the prize", and it follows all the rules of Italian grammar.
1	The sentence "Tommaso si è danneggiato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and uses the correct reflexive verb form for the third person singular masculine pronoun "Tommaso."
1	The sentence "Quegli uomini hanno denunciato se stessi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, the plural third person pronoun "quegli uomini" agrees with the verb "hanno denunciato," which is also in its plural form. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "se stessi" refers to the antecedent "uomini." Therefore, this sentence can be considered as grammatically acceptable.
0	In this sentence, there is no need for an article before the direct object pronoun "le". A correct version of this phrase would be "Lo compro y lo leo" (I buy it and I read it). The use of both "compro" and "lego" implies that the speaker buys and reads the same thing, so it should be referred to with the masculine singular pronoun "lo", which corresponds to "book" being a masculine noun ending in -o.
1	The sentence "I have met Lorenzo not Emma" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("I"), verb ("have met") and two objects ("Lorenzo", "Emma"). Also, there are no apparent orthographical or syntactical errors that would make this sentence incorrect.
0	The correct phrase should be "I don't want to look at it," with the subject-verb agreement "don't want" instead of "doesn't want."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It would be more natural to say "I met many of Riccardo's friends," but the given sentence is also acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the structure or word choice of this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I haven't found many" is the past tense of "I don't find many," and it indicates that the speaker has not discovered or come across many instances of something.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The sentence communicates a complete thought and all of the elements contribute to its meaning. Well done!
1	The sentence "Maria said hello to her parents" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense for past actions.
1	The sentence "I have never met such an intelligent person" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of English sentences with subject-verb agreement and proper use of tense.
1	The sentence "Riccardo doesn't believe, I think, that they are very intelligent." is grammatically correct. It includes the appropriate use of verb tense and agreement, punctuation, and subject-verb agreement.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject it agrees with. In this case, "hanno" is the third person plural form and does not agree with the singular subject "molte persone". Therefore, the sentence "Hanno chiamato molte persone quel numero." is grammatically incorrect. The correct version would be "È stato chiamato quel numero da molte persone." or "Molte persone hanno chiamato quel numero.", depending on what you want to express.
1	The sentence "Che cosa ha comprato Riccardo?" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an interrogative sentence in Italian. It uses the appropriate form of the verb (ha + past participle) to ask about a past action and includes the subject pronoun che, which is necessary for clarifying the question's focus on the direct object.
1	The sentence "Andrea has met Leonardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Andrea"), auxiliary verb ("has") and past participle form of the main verb ("met"). Also, the punctuation at the end of the sentence is appropriate (period).
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "who" or "whom" should agree with the subject that follows it. In this case, since "Leonardo" is singular, the correct form of the verb would be "was", not "were". So the grammatically correct sentence would be: "Riccardo asked by whom Leonardo was not seen."
1	The sentence "Leonardo, they told me that he will speak tomorrow." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper punctuation marks to separate different parts of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Gabriele, when did you see him?" is grammatically correct. It consists of an interrogative phrase ("when did") that seeks information about the time of an event and addresses a person named Gabriele with a question tag ("you see him"). This structure is commonly used to ask questions in English.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "In which drawer did Leo put the papers?" is a question that follows standard English syntax rules. It has a subject ("Leonardo"), an auxiliary verb ("did") to form a yes-no question, and the past tense of the main verb ("put"). Additionally, it includes the preposition "in" followed by the noun phrase "which drawer," indicating where the action was performed. Finally, the direct object "the papers" completes the structure of this transitive sentence.
0	The correct form should be "Which politician has spoken?" instead of "Quale politco hanno parlato?". It requires the third person singular verb form "has" and the subject-verb agreement is necessary for grammatical correctness.
0	The sentence is difficult to understand due to the repeated use of pronouns and indirect references. It can be rephrased for clarity as follows: "Which politician did the judge declare had spoken on the radio?"
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha detto che partirà domani." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "Lorenzo" is the subject, which agrees with the third person singular verb form "ha detto". Additionally, the future tense of "partire" is used correctly to indicate that Lorenzo will leave tomorrow.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Francesco" is the subject of the first clause and "we" are the subjects of the second clause. Both clauses express separate actions that occurred at different times, so it's appropriate to use a period between them instead of a comma. Additionally, there's no need for any conjunction like 'and' since they represent two distinct events.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax and contains proper verb agreement between the subject ("la tempesta") and its corresponding auxiliary verb ("ha abbattuto"). Additionally, the use of articles before "quercia" and "figliol prodigo" is appropriate for singular nouns in Italian. Overall, there are no apparent errors or issues with this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It literally means "Who touches the wires dies," which implies that touching electrical wires can be fatal.
1	The sentence "Alessandro, who came to visit me yesterday, told me to greet you." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an independent clause ("Alessandro told me to greet you.") and a dependent relative clause ("who came to visit me yesterday"). Additionally, the verb tense transitions smoothly from past tense ("came") to present tense ("tells"), which creates logical flow within the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The sentence is written in standard English and all the words used are correctly spelled. Additionally, the use of punctuation marks such as periods, commas, and quotation marks follow the rules of formal writing.
1	The sentence "Il timore della guerra è ingiustificato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "timore," which means fear or apprehension, is a singular noun that requires the third-person singular form of the verb to agree with its subject. In this case, the verb "è" (is) agrees with the subject "il timore." Additionally, "della guerra" functions as an adjectival phrase modifying the noun "timore." Overall, the structure of the sentence is consistent with standard Italian usage.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha perso le chiavi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. The singular subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "ha perso". Additionally, the plural direct object "le chiavi" agrees with the gender and number of the nouns being referred to (in this case, keys).
1	The sentence "Alessandro è bramoso di potere" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "è" agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro". Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled.
1	The sentence "Penso che Francesco domandi l'ora a Lorenzo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language conjugation for the present tense of the verb "pensare" (to think) and "domandare" (to ask). Additionally, the syntax of the sentence with the use of subordinate clause introduced by "che" (that), followed by the main clause, is also correct.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha affermato che Edoardo parla." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for present tense regular verbs (parl-are). The subject "Tommaso" is followed by the appropriate auxiliary verb "ha affermato" (third person singular form of "affermare") which agrees with its subject, while the second part of the sentence maintains the same subject "Edoardo" along with the third person singular form of the verb "parlare", agreeing with its own subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Avendo" is the present participle of the verb "avere", which means "having". It agrees with the subject "Io" and it is correctly used to indicate an action that happens at the same time as another one (in this case, "sostenere una posizione diversa").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha" (has) agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso". Additionally, the imperative form of the verb "difendere" does not require an object pronoun to be placed before it, so the phrase "ad Andrea" correctly indicates who should defend Tommaso.
0	The correct form of the verb to agree with "il fatto" should be "è", not "ci sono". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence is: "Il fatto di essere stato scoperto un delitto ci ha sconvolti."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "chi" can be either singular or plural and it matches with the verb "pensi", which is also in second person singular form. Therefore, there are no errors in the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It states that "the chair on which you sat is broken."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It might be a bit difficult to understand due to the complex structure and the use of pronouns (this person, Edoardo, Tommaso) that refer to other nouns or phrases already mentioned. However, from a purely grammar perspective, it's correct.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "who" or "that" should agree with the subject that follows it. In this case, since "Sofia" is singular, the correct form of the verb would be "has". Therefore, the sentence should read as follows: "Edoardo believes who Sophia has kissed." However, even if we fix the verb agreement issue, the sentence remains ambiguous because it's not clear whether Edoardo believes that someone else has kissed Sofia or he himself has been kissed by her. To avoid confusion, it would be better to rephrase the sentence using a different construction. For example: "Edoardo thinks that Sofia was the one who did the kissing (or) Edoardo thinks that he was the one whom Sofia kissed."
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, "I" is the singular first-person pronoun and requires the use of "am". Therefore, the sentence "Me and my friend doesn't know how we can solve this problem" is grammatically incorrect as it uses the plural form of the verb instead of the singular one. A corrected version would be: "My friend and I don't know how we can solve this problem."
0	The correct form of the verb "to have" should be used after "he". In this case, it would be "has", not "abbia". Additionally, there is no need for an auxiliary verb here since "ha" or "has" can stand alone as the main verb. So, a grammatically correct version could simply be "He has seen him."
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject. In this case, "we" is the plural subject and it requires the verb "have" to be in its plural form "have". Therefore, "has seen" should be changed to "have seen". A possible correction could be: "We have seen that."
1	The sentence "Sofia says that Alessandro will speak tomorrow" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a subordinate clause ("that Alessandro will speak tomorrow") introduced by the conjunction "that" and embedded within an independent clause ("Sofia says"). All the verbs are correctly conjugated for tense (past) and subject-verb agreement.
0	The sentence contains multiple errors and is not grammatically correct. Here are the issues with the sentence: - "ha declated" should be "has declared". The verb "to declare" must agree with the subject "Beatrice", which requires the third person singular form of the verb ("declares"). - "che se stessa" can be omitted from the sentence as it adds no meaning to what follows. If one wants to emphasize that Beatrice was referring to herself, then "herself" would come after "with Gabriele": "...that she had nothing to do with Gabriele himself." - "non ha mi" should be "she didn't have me"; however, this creates an ambiguity about who or what Beatrice did not have anything to do with. A better way to phrase this idea might be "didn't involve her" (or "had involved herself") if the intention is to indicate Beatrice's lack of involvement in something related to Gabriele. Therefore, a corrected version could read: Corrected Sentence: Beatrice has declared that she didn't involve herself with Gabriele.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha detto che Andrea si è guardato" is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are used appropriately according to Italian syntax and morphology rules. Here we have an independent clause ("Riccardo ha detto") with a dependent one introduced by "che," which refers to what was said; moreover, it uses the reflexive verb correctly, as "si è guardato" matches the third person singular form.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. "Il padre di Andrea" is the subject and it agrees with its verb "è". Also, the use of past tense ("mi è sembrato") correctly situates this action in time.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It contains multiple subjunctive forms which are used to express various states of unreality such as doubt, possibility, necessity, or action that has not yet occurred. In this case, "veda" is the third person singular indicative form of the verb "vedere", while "creda" and "voglia" are both third person singular subjunctive forms of the verbs "credere" and "volere". Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses the belief of Edoardo about what Emma wants Tommaso to see, namely Gabriele. All verbs are conjugated correctly according to their subject and tense.
1	The sentence "Il coniglio mangia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for the Italian language where singular subjects require singular verbs and vice versa. In this case, the singular subject "il coniglio" (the rabbit) matches with the singular verb "mangia" (eats).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English, we use the object form "which book" instead of the subject form "what book" after a preposition such as "of". Additionally, there should be an article before "professor", so it would be more natural to say "What book does the professor recommend reading?" or "Which book did the professor recommend that you read?" However, I will still label this as grammatically correct because these are minor issues and some variations may be acceptable depending on context.
0	The correct form of the verb "to be" should be used after "me". In this case, it should be "I", not "me". Therefore, the sentence should read: "It was I who arrived first, not you."
1	The sentence "Arriva un uomo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular present tense ("arriva").
1	The sentence "Leonardo uccise Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the simple past tense (passato remoto). In this case, "uccise" is the third person singular masculine form of the verb "uccidere," which means "to kill." Therefore, the use of "uccise" agrees with its subject "Leonardo" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), making the sentence grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in subject-verb agreement or word choice that would make it incorrect.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha voglia di andare al mare." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Gabriele". Additionally, the word order is also correct, making this sentence completely acceptable in formal or informal written or spoken contexts.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It features the relative pronoun "that" to introduce a clause which modifies the object of the main clause ("this book"). The verb "had read" agrees with its subject, the first person singular (implicit) "I".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the use of tense, agreement, word order or vocabulary choice. However, without additional context it may be difficult to say for sure if all aspects are appropriate as some nuances can only be understood within a broader conversational setting.
1	The sentence "Alessandro crede che invaderemo quel paese" is grammatically correct because all the elements of the sentence are used appropriately according to Italian syntax and morphology rules. In this case, the subject-verb agreement is respected (the verb "crede" agrees with its third person singular subject "Alessandro"), and there are no missing or extra words that would make it incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. Therefore, it can be considered acceptable as it stands.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense "scriveva" to indicate that Alessandro was writing a book last year, and the present perfect continuous tense "non l'ha ancora finito" to show that he has not finished it yet. This creates a clear contrast between what happened in the past and what hasn't been completed up until now.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice or punctuation. The use of the past tense "scrisse" and the present perfect tense "has not finished yet" indicate that there has been an action completed (writing) in the past but finishing hasn't happened until now. This creates a clear timeline for the events described. Good job!
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that there are two different people being referred to - one who is single (Gabriele) and the other who is married.
1	The sentence "The current king of France is bald." is grammatically correct because all the elements are used appropriately and follow English language rules. There are no spelling mistakes or missing words. Additionally, it conveys a complete thought that can be understood by native speakers.
1	The sentence "Qualche studente ha superato l'esame" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "alcuni studenti" (some students) serves as the subject of the sentence, while "ha superato" (has passed) is the third person singular verb that agrees with the subject. Additionally, the adjective "qualche" modifies the noun "studenti," which comes before its corresponding verb. Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The use of the negation "not" after "every student" correctly negates the whole statement without affecting its meaning. This construction emphasizes that no exceptions exist among students regarding passing or failing the exam.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la corte" agrees with the verb "dichiarò" in number and tense. Additionally, the word "innocente" correctly describes the defendant as not guilty of the crime they were accused of commaging.
0	In inglese standard, il verbo ausiliare da utilizzare con i pronomi soggetto di terza persona singolare (he, she, it) nella forma negativa è "does" anziché "don't", che si usa comunemente solo con i pronomi di prima e seconda persona singolari (I, you). Quindi, la forma corretta sarebbe stata "She doesn't like to share her things".
1	The sentence "Ho preso le chiavi" is grammatically correct because it follows the proper Italian syntax for first-person singular past tense ("Ho preso") and plural noun ("le chiavi").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement or word usage. The use of quotations and the reporting structure is also appropriate. Good job!
1	The sentence "Una bella casa fa comodo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, the singular feminine noun "casa" agrees with the third person singular verb form "fa".
0	In this sentence, the verb "have" must agree with its subject "pencil," which is singular. The correct form should be "has": "The pencil has run out of lead." Therefore, I will give it a label of 0 because it is grammatically incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gladio" is an Italian noun that means "sword," and the singular form of the present tense for "to use" (usare) agrees with it correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses proper punctuation.
1	La frase è grammaticalmente corretta. È una forma abbreviata informale dell'espressione "Mi scusi", che si usa per chiedere scusa o attirare l'attenzione di qualcuno gentilmente nella lingua italiana.
1	The sentence "Le ragazze sono arrivate." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, "le ragazze" (plural feminine) matches with the plural verb form "sono".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word usage, or syntax. The sentence expresses a clear idea and all the words are used appropriately to convey that idea. Good job!
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the structure or word choice of this sentence. It expresses a statement about what someone says regarding the lack of meetings between people.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Legge" is the third person singular form of the verb "leggere", which agrees with the subject "he".
0	The verb "andare" should agree with the subject "Io" (I) and should be conjugated as "Vado". Therefore, the correct sentence is: "Vado a casa, ho incontrato tuo fratello."
1	The sentence "Sto andando a prendere la macchina." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "sto andando" (present continuous of "andare") agrees with its singular subject "io", which is implied in this case. Additionally, the article "la" before "macchina" correctly matches the gender and number of the noun.
1	The sentence "It isn't true that the appearance of places changes like the face of men." is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. However, it should be noted that this sentence may still be difficult for some to understand due to its complex structure and abstract concepts.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper punctuation.
1	The sentence "Io sono affamato." is grammatically correct because it follows the proper Italian subject-verb agreement and uses the correct form of the adjective based on the gender and number of the speaker. In this case, "Io" (first person singular) matches with "sono" (third person singular present indicative of the verb "essere") and "affamato" (masculine singular).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Bravo, this boy." is a complete and meaningful English sentence with the subject "this boy" and an adjective "bravo" that describes it.
1	The sentence "Paola è una donna che apprezziamo molto." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb (in this case, "è") agrees with its singular subject (here, "Paola"). Additionally, the word order and overall structure are also proper for an Italian declarative statement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It asks an open-ended question about the person's plans for tomorrow using the auxiliary verb "do" and the present tense of the main verb "to be," which agrees with the subject "you."
1	The sentence "Ho visto il libro che mi hai regalato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, the past tense form "ho visto" agrees with the first person singular subject "Io," while "il" before "libro" indicates that we are dealing with a masculine singular noun. Moreover, there is no gender or number mismatch among other words in the sentence. Therefore, I would say it's an acceptable construction in standard Italian language use.
0	The sentence requires the definite article "the" before "whose". Also, there should be an agreement between the subject and verb, so it should be "friends whose teacher is Andrea", not "il cui maestro è Andrea." A correct version of this phrase would be: "Gli amici le cui insegnanti sono Andrea." (Assuming that we are referring to multiple female teachers named Andrea).
0	The verb "do" should agree with the subject "phone," which is plural, but it should be used as an auxiliary verb here to form a negation, so the correct form of "to be" for third person singular (phones) should be used after it. Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be: "The phones don't work."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Ci" is a reflexive pronoun that refers to the indirect object of the first clause ("si" is the direct object). In English, this would be translated as "He fell and hurt himself."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are two complete verbs in the past tense "volevano" and "hanno distrutto," which agree with their respective subjects "loro" (implied) and "l'".
0	The verb "prenda" should be in the plural form "prendete". Also, there is no need for an imperative to be followed by the pronoun "il", so it should just say "Ognuno prendete il suo cappotto."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Take me that gadget" is a complete and meaningful English sentence with proper subject-verb agreement and no obvious grammar mistakes.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("I"), an action ("have given") and an object ("the child"). Then it explains the consequence of this action with another simple sentence "but he didn't drink it".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two independent clauses that are connected by the coordinating conjunction "io". Each clause has its own subject and verb: "Maria" (subject) uses "the computer" (direct object), while "I" (subject) don't know how to use it (verb phrase).
1	The sentence "I saw a house" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("I"), a verb ("saw") and an object ("house"). The tense used (past simple) indicates that the action was completed at some point in the past, which is appropriate for describing something you have seen before.
1	The sentence "Ho visto tua madre" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "ho visto" (I saw) agrees with its singular subject "Io". Additionally, all of the words are correctly conjugated and spelled according to their respective parts of speech.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no need for any changes to be made. A possible interpretation of the sentence could be "the person who spoke to me."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case "one" acts as an impersonal pronoun and takes the third person singular form of the verb, which is "va". Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Fa male la mia testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing discomfort or pain in Italian. In this case, the singular form of the verb "fare" (fa) agrees with its subject ("la mala", understood from context), and the possessive adjective "mia" correctly modifies the noun "testa".
1	The sentence "I have two houses" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct verb tense and agreement between subject and verb. In this sentence, "I" is the first-person singular pronoun, and "have" is an irregular verb that agrees with the subject. Additionally, "two houses" is a plural noun phrase, which correctly follows the linking verb "have."
0	In this sentence, the subject "I" requires the verb to be in the first person singular form "have." However, the sentence uses the plural form "do," which does not agree with the subject. The grammatically correct version would be "I have houses."
1	The sentence "The horse that won the race has been unsaddled." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "has" is used as an auxiliary verb to form the present perfect tense, which indicates that the action of unsaddling the winning horse happened at an unspecified time before now.
1	The sentence "I cavalli sono animali resistenti." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. In this case, the plural form "cavalli" and the verb conjugation "sono" agree with each other as they both refer to multiple horses.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "has" is used as the third person singular present tense of the verb "to have", which agrees with its subject "he".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "He has arrived" is the past participle form of the verb "to arrive," used with auxiliary verb "has." It indicates that at some point in the past, he came to a certain place and is still there or his arrival is relevant for the present moment.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and there are no obvious errors in tense, word choice or punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple conditional tense in Italian ("Magari domani piovesse" would be the more formal version). "Piova" (singular form) is used as the verb instead of "pioveranno" (plural form), which makes sense since we are referring to an uncertain future event rather than multiple events happening simultaneously.
1	The sentence "Lui è stato colto dalla pioggia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and syntax.
1	The sentence "Scrive una lettera a sua zia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb (scrive) agrees with its singular subject (the person writing the letter). In this case, both the subject and the verb are in third person singular form, which is consistent with each other.
1	The sentence "Egli lo vedeva" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Egli" (which means "he") is the subject and "lo" (direct object pronoun referring to "it") is the object of the verb "vedeva" (the imperfect form of "vedere", which means "to see").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, word usage, or syntax. The sentence communicates a complete thought and all the words seem to be used correctly in their respective forms and functions.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non ha tempo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "Riccardo" (the subject) agrees with the verb "ha" (third person singular), which means "has." Additionally, "tempo" refers to time or weather, depending on context, so this usage is also acceptable.
1	The sentence "Ho riparato il tavolo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a conjugated verb and its direct object. In this case, "ho riparato" is the first person singular present tense form of the verb "riparare," which means to fix or repair. Meanwhile, "il tavolo" is the direct object that receives the action of the verb. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "I fixed the table."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "hanno" is the third person plural form of the verb "avere," which means "to have." It agrees with its subject "they." Therefore, there are no grammar mistakes in the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "le" is used as a formal subject pronoun for singular feminine nouns and it agrees with the indirect object "Le" (to her). Also, the past participle "è stato" agrees with the direct object "il cappello" because of avoir conjugation rule.
1	The sentence "Quel ragazzo apre la porta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper endings for nouns and verbs according to Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Ho sentito cantare i ragazzi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, "ho sentito" (I heard) serves as the auxiliary verb to indicate that the action occurred in the past tense, while "cantare" (to sing) functions as the main verb in its gerund form (-ando). Additionally, the direct object pronoun "i" agrees with the plural noun "ragazzi," which refers to multiple boys singing. Therefore, there are no errors or inconsistencies within this phrase.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject. In this sentence, "la macchina" is feminine singular and requires "vuole", but "lavarla" indicates that there would be another feminine singular noun following it (e.g., "La macchina vuole lavarlo."). Therefore, the phrase is grammatically incorrect.
1	The sentence "I was wondering if you could help me understand why this phrase is grammatically correct" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English question with a subject-auxiliary inversion and uses appropriate verb forms for tense consistency.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is an inversion of the subject and auxiliary verb "è" (is) which is used to form a rhetorical question for emphasis. In this case, it means something like "*It's* coming to Naples that I don't want."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("al bagno"), a proper verb tense for the subject-verb agreement ("fa"), an adjective to describe how the speaker feels about it ("piacere") and a first person pronoun "mi" that serves as indirect object of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Hai presente Lorenzo?" can be translated to "Do you know Lorenzo?" and it's a proper question with the correct use of verb conjugation and word order.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used after "and". It should be "is" instead of "are". So the grammatically correct sentence is: He is from Spain and she is from Italy.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used based on the subject. In this case, "them" is plural and requires the verb to be in its plural form ("have") rather than the singular form ("has"). Therefore, the sentence "They has been studying for hours." is grammatically incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are some minor punctuation errors (there should be a comma after "piangevo" and before the conjunction "and"), but they don't affect the overall grammar of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses appropriate punctuation marks. Additionally, it conveys a positive message about someone who is consistently reliable, patient, and honest.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Il vento" agrees with the verb "può", and both are singular. Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
0	The sentence "Piangere forte" is not grammatically correct because it lacks a subject and the verb is in its infinitive form. A possible correction could be "Lui piange forte" (He cries loudly) or "Ella piange forte" (She cries loudly), where we have an explicit subject and the verb "piangere" changes to match the gender of the subject.
1	The sentence "Ho preso in casa una specie di gatto" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. The subject "ho preso" (I took) agrees with the singular verb "è" (is), and "una specie di gatto" (a kind of cat) correctly uses the partitive article "una."
1	The sentence "Ho preso lo zucchero" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "ho preso" (I took) agrees with its singular subject "Io" which is often omitted in informal speech. Also, the definite article "lo" correctly precedes the noun "zucchero".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses appropriate tense. "I" as the subject agrees with the verb "like".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of the subject "quel che vendo" and the predicate "è merce cinese". The verb "è" agrees with the singular noun "merce", which is the subject complement. Also, the word order follows the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) pattern in Italian language.
0	The sentence is missing the verb "to be" or another main verb to form a complete thought. It should say something like "Putting dishes away quickly."
1	The sentence "È stato indetto un concorso" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian sentences. In this case, "è" (the third person singular form of the verb "essere") agrees with its singular subject "concorso".
1	The sentence "Tutte le balene devono essere protette" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. The plural subject "tutte le balene" matches with the third person plural verb form "devono".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Metti" is the singular imperative form of the verb "mettere", used here to give an order or instruction. It agrees with the singular subject "tu".
0	The phrase contains a contradiction because the adjective "vecchia" (old) and "nuova" (new) cannot be used together to describe the same object without further context or explanation. It would not typically make logical sense for something to be both old and new at the same time.
1	The sentence "Leonardo doesn't know María" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English negative statement with auxiliary verb (does) before the base form of the main verb (know), and proper use of subject-verb agreement where the third person singular subject ("Leonardo") matches with the third person singular verb ("does know"). Also, there are no capitalization or punctuation errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("The government") and a verb ("has abolished"). Additionally, "la" agrees with its preceding singular feminine noun "legge".
1	The sentence "Ho spazzolato le scarpe." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a conjugated verb and its direct object. In this case, "ho spazzolato" is the first-person singular present tense form of the verb "spazzolare," meaning "to brush," while "le scarpe" is the plural feminine direct object that refers to shoes. Therefore, the speaker brushed their shoes.
1	The sentence "Tommaso abita da dieci anni." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and uses the correct form of the verb "abitare" for the singular masculine subject "Tommaso". Additionally, the time expression "da dieci anni" correctly indicates how long he has been living there.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha dato un libro a Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for both the subject (Riccardo) and indirect object (Sofia). Additionally, the article "un" agrees with the singular noun "libro".
1	The sentence "Maria has run for hours" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Maria"), auxiliary verb ("has") and past participle form of the main verb ("run"). Additionally, the tense used (present perfect) correctly expresses that something started in the past and continued up until now.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha bevuto un caffè" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "ha bevuto" (has drunk) agrees with its singular masculine subject "Francesco". Also, the article "un" before "caffè" correctly indicates that one coffee has been consumed by the subject.
1	The sentence "Andrea has found a ticket for the opera." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense (past tense) to indicate that the action of finding the ticket occurred in the past. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and there are no obvious errors in punctuation or capitalization.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo sta compilando" can be translated to "Edoardo is compiling" in English. The verb "stare" is used correctly as a helping verb for the gerund form of the verb "compilare".
0	The verb "emanate" requires an object to complete its meaning, so the sentence "Emanare profumo." is not grammatically correct because it lacks an object. It should be something like "Emanano un buon profumo.", which means "They emit a good scent."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate (verb). In this case, the correction would be "Si sta aprendo un nuovo negozio" or "Apriranno un nuovo negozio", depending on context.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a subject. A proper sentence should begin with a capital letter and include both a subject and a predicate (verb). Therefore, "Iniziamo un'attività" would be an acceptable form of this phrase.
1	The sentence "La porta si è chiusa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, the singular feminine noun "porta" agrees with the past participle "chiusa," which also has a feminine singular form. Additionally, the verb "è" comes after the subject "la porta." Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Gabriele non ammette di essere preso in giro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. Here are some details to support this judgment: - "Gabriele" is a proper noun that refers to a male individual, so we use the masculine singular form "non ammette." - "essere preso in giro" means "to be teased," where "esserE" is an auxiliary verb used with the past participle "preso" (masculine singular). This construction agrees with the subject "Gabriele." Overall, I would say that this sentence is acceptable and understandable for native speakers of Italian.
1	The sentence "Paola has returned the book" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense for past actions with a clear subject ("Paola") and object ("the book").
0	The correct form of the verb to have after he/she/it should be "has" and not "ha". So, it should be "What has he taken?" instead.
1	The sentence "Le scarpe si sono macchiate" is grammatically correct because the verb "si sono macchiate" agrees with the plural subject "le scarpe". In Italian, just like in English, when using reflexive verbs (such as "macchiarsi") and passive voice, it is necessary to match the number of the subject with that of the verb.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Le giornate" is the plural form of "la giornata," but it can also be used as a feminine plural subject to agree with the verb when talking about days in general (without specifying which particular days). In this case, "si sono accorciate" agrees with "le giornate."
1	The sentence "Qualcosa ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "Something has shortened the days". The subject-verb agreement is correct with "qualcosa" (something) being singular and "ha accorciato" (has shortened) also being in the third person singular form. Additionally, the plural noun "giornate" (days) agrees with its adjective "le", which indicates that it refers to feminine plural nouns. Overall, this sentence follows standard Italian syntax rules and uses appropriate verb conjugations for the given context.
1	The sentence "Qualcuno ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where singular subjects take a singular verb and plural subjects take a plural verb. In this case, "qualcuno" (someone) is a singular noun that requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "accorciare" which is "ha accorciato." Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Aggrapparsi a un ramo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and verb agreement. In this case, "aggrapparsi" (to cling) agrees with the singular subject "uno" which is implied by the article "un". Additionally, the phrase "ad un ramo" correctly indicates the location where the action takes place.
1	The sentence "Arenated themselves, the crews disembarked." is grammatically correct. There are no glaring errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word usage, or punctuation that would warrant labeling this sentence as incorrect. However, it should be noted that there might be some missing context for words like "arenated" and "disembarked," which could affect how we interpret their meanings. Nonetheless, from a purely linguistic perspective, the sentence appears to be accurate.
1	The sentence "La nebbia si è dissolta" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate singular form of "essere" (si è) to match with the subject "la nebbia". Additionally, "dissolta" agrees with "nebbia" in gender and number.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "si" should be replaced with "always cries". In the present simple tense of regular verbs ending in "-o", we add an "-s" to form the third person singular (he, she, it). Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Alessandro always cries."
1	The sentence "Riccardo si lagna sempre" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb form changes depending on the gender and number of the subject. In this case, "si lagna" agrees with the singular masculine noun "Riccardo".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alle" is the plural form of "to the," which agrees with its object "sue parole" (her words).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "l'acqua" (water) agrees with the singular verb "è" (is).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for forming questions in English and uses appropriate verb tense and subject-verb agreement.
1	The sentence "Riccardo pedala" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, the singular subject "Riccardo" matches with the third person singular present tense verb form "pedala."
0	The correct form of the past participle for the verb "approfitta" is "approfittato", but it should agree with the gender and number of its subject. In this case, if we assume that the subject is singular (for example, "lui" or "una persona"), then the sentence requires an masculine or feminine singular form, which would be "l'ha approfittata". However, without more context, I cannot determine whether my assumption about the subject being singular is correct. Therefore, I will label the sentence as grammatically incorrect since there are insufficient details to make it grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice, or sentence structure.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "il figlio" (the son) refers to only one person, so the singular form of the verb "sedeva" (was sitting) must be used.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "ammuffisce" agrees with the subject "il muro", and it is correctly conjugated in the third person singular present tense to match the gender (masculine) and number (singular). Additionally, the preposition "in" followed by "una giornata" indicates that the mold grows on the wall during one day.
1	The sentence "Paola is playing a piece by Bach" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "Paola." Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are used correctly and coherently.
1	The sentence "Il coro canta molto bene" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require the use of a singular verb and plural subjects require the use of a plural verb. In this case, "il coro" (the choir) is a single entity that requires the usage of the third person singular form "canta".
1	The sentence "Riccardo aspirava sempre il fumo del sigaro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order for Italian sentences. The verb "aspirava" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo," and the preposition "del" introduces the possessive phrase "sigaro." Additionally, the adverb "sempre" modifies the verb "aspirava," indicating that Riccardo always smoked the cigar. Overall, this sentence has no grammar or syntax errors.
1	The sentence "Andrea aspires to become a doctor" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate verb tense.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo doesn't have to cook." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a negative statement in English with the subject-auxiliary verb inversion and the use of the contraction "doesn't" before the base form of the verb "to cook". Additionally, there are no apparent errors in word choice or agreement between the subject and the verb.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "la lettera" is feminine singular and requires the verb to be conjugated as "scrive," but instead it was written in third person plural form "scrivono."
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, "you" is singular and requires the use of "are," not "is." Therefore, the sentence should read as follows: "You isn't happy today." should be changed to "You aren't happy today."
1	The sentence "Leonardo is writing" is grammatically correct because it uses the present continuous tense to describe an action that is currently happening (writing). The subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "is," and the ending "-ing" on "writing" shows that the action is ongoing.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non scrive più da un pezzo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject, which agrees with the third-person singular verb form "non scrive," while "più" indicates that this action has been ongoing for some time. Finally, "da un pezzo" serves as an adverbial phrase specifying the duration since Riccardo last wrote. Therefore, there are no apparent errors or inconsistencies in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Il macchinista si è fermato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, "macchinista" is a singular noun that requires the third person singular verb form "si è."
0	The verb "hanno" should agree with the subject "I negozianti", which is plural. However, it does not make sense for a group of shopkeepers to increase; instead, we would say that they raised prices or took some other action. So even if the verb agreement were corrected ("I negozianti hanno alzato"), the sentence would still be semantically odd and therefore unacceptable.
1	The sentence "I bicchieri si sono rotti" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "bicchieri" is plural, so the third person plural form of the verb "essere," which is "sono," must be used. However, since the verb "essere" is being used as an auxiliary verb to form the passive voice, its conjugated form changes depending on the past participle that follows. Here, the past participle is "rotti", which agrees with the subject "bicchieri." Therefore, even though we have the plural form of "essere," it remains grammatically correct when combined with the past participle "rotti".
1	The sentence "Paola ha acceso il fuoco." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and uses proper verb conjugations for the third person singular feminine form ("ha acceso" instead of "hanno accesi"). Additionally, all words are correctly spelled and there are no missing or extra elements in the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of the verb "to improve" (in this case "has improved") agrees with the subject "Il soggiorno" and matches the third person singular form required for it. Additionally, the preposition "in" followed by the country name "Canada" indicates where the improvement took place, which makes the meaning clear and coherent.
1	The sentence "La lezione ha continuato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular third person subjects require the use of the verb form "ha." In this case, "lezione" is a feminine singular noun and thus requires "ha" instead of "hanno," which would be used for plural subjects.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of two words and expresses the action of jumping over an obstacle without any grammar mistakes.
1	The sentence "Tutti si sono commossi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of agreement between subject and verb in Italian. In this case, "tutti" (all) is a plural noun that requires the use of the third person plural form of the verb "essere" (to be), which is "sono." However, since "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun here, indicating that everyone moved themselves emotionally, we need to consider it part of the subject, making the whole subject plural, so the correct conjugation for the verb would indeed be "si sono commossi".
1	The sentence "Si è macchiata la tovaglia" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules for reflexive verbs in Italian. In this case, "si" is used as a singular reflexive pronoun and agrees with the subject of the sentence (implicitly understood as "lei"). The past participle "macchiata" also agrees with the gender and number of the subject. Therefore, there are no mistakes in this sentence from a grammatical point of view.
1	The sentence "Macchia il vino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian imperative sentence (command) with a singular subject ("tu"), which does not require any verb conjugation for the second person singular pronoun. In this case, "macchia" serves as both the subject and the verb, meaning "stain", and "il vino" is the direct object, referring to the wine that needs staining.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English, we use the plural form "are" with the subject "water" when referring to it as a general concept or substance, rather than a specific quantity of water. Therefore, "The water are gelatinous" would be incorrect, but "The water is gelatinous" is correct because it treats "water" as a mass noun.
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject. In this case, "le tappe" is plural and requires the use of the third person plural form of the verb. Therefore, it should be "Le tappe hanno bruciato", but since the sentence states that they burned for an hour (bruciarono per un'ora), which implies past tense, the grammatically correct version would be "Le tappe erano bruciate da un'ora".
1	The sentence "Il vetro si rompe" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. "Vetro" (glass) is a masculine singular noun that requires the third person singular verb form "si rompe".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, word choice or punctuation usage. The action described by the verb "ha verificato" (has verified) refers to a completed event, which matches the past tense of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo lava la macchina." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian where the verb form changes depending on whether the subject is singular or plural and its gender. In this case, "lava" agrees with the masculine singular noun "Riccardo".
1	The sentence "Paola ha visto la partita con gli amici." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. Here, "ha" (the third person singular form of the verb "avere," meaning "to have") agrees with its subject "Paola"; "visto" (the past participle of "vedere," meaning "to see") correctly matches with "ha;" and finally, all words are placed in their proper positions according to the SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) structure in Italian language.
1	The sentence "Gabriele si è tagliato le basette." is grammatically correct. In this Italian sentence, the reflexive verb "si è tagliato" (has cut himself) agrees with the masculine singular subject "Gabriele". Furthermore, the plural possessive adjective "le" correctly matches with the feminine plural noun "basettes", which refers to small sideburns or hair below the ears. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è tagliato il mento con il rasoio." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here are some reasons why this sentence is acceptable: * The subject "Riccardo" agrees with the third person singular verb form "si è". * The past participle "tagliato" agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the direct object "il mento", which requires the use of the auxiliary verb "essere" instead of "avere". * The word order respects the VS pattern for compound tense verbs, where the auxiliary verb comes before the main verb ("si è tagliato").
1	The sentence "Francesco si è calmato, irrigidito." is grammatically correct because both verbs "calmato" and "irrigidito" are in the past participle form and agree with the subject "Francesco". Additionally, they correctly use the auxiliary verb "è", which agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the subject.
1	The sentence "Si è rotto il vetro" is grammatically correct because it uses the reflexive verb "si è rotto" correctly with the subject "il vetro". In this case, "si" serves as an impersonal pronoun and "è rotto" is the third person singular of the past participle "rompere", which agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of "vetro".
0	The verbs "mangiate" and "bevute" should agree with the subject "venite," which is second person plural. However, there doesn't seem to be a main verb for the subject "voi" (you) in this sentence. It seems like some words are missing or misplaced. A correct version of this phrase could be "Venite alla festa e mangiatate e beveteci."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il dibattito è continuato" can be translated as "The debate has continued." In this case, the third person singular form of the verb "essere" (to be) should be used after the subject "il dibattito," and that is what occurs here with "è." Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that the debate or argument continued. No errors were found in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha cancellato la scritta." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a simple past tense verb ("ha cancellato"). All words are correctly conjugated and spelled.
1	The sentence "Leonardo suona il telefono." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian and uses the correct conjugation for the third person singular verb form "suona" to match the subject "Leonardo". Additionally, the definite article "il" before "telefono" correctly indicates that this noun refers to a specific phone rather than any phone in general.
1	The sentence "Il livello si è alzato" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate singular form of the past tense of the verb "alzarsi." In this case, "si è alzato" correctly indicates that the level (il livello) rose or increased by itself without any external influence.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha bruciato la torta." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated according to gender and number agreement rules.
1	The sentence "Edoardo è pentito." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian language where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the singular subject "Edoardo" correctly uses the third person singular verb form "è".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il bosco" (the forest) agrees with the singular verb "si è" (has burned), and the duration of three hours is correctly expressed by "per tre ore".
1	The sentence "La biancheria si è asciugata per un'ora" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "si è" is the third person singular verb form that agrees with its subject "la biancheria." Also, "per un'ora" indicates for an hour which describes how long the laundry has been drying.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice or sentence structure. All the words used are appropriate and correctly spelled. Additionally, the punctuation is also correct. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è ingrassato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard format for expressing reflexive actions in Italian. In this case, "si" serves as a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject of the sentence ("Riccardo"), and "è" agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the subject. Additionally, "ingrassare" is an intransitive verb that does not take a direct object, making the sentence grammatically sound.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax rules and uses the past tense "has" correctly to indicate possession.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, "television" is singular, so the sentence requires the third person singular form "is," not the plural form "si sono." A possible grammatically correct version could be: "La televisione si è rotta in un'ora."
1	The sentence "Alle 8 in punto la sala si è svuotata." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. Here are some reasons why this sentence is correct: - The use of the past tense (passato prossimo) with "si è svuotata" indicates that the action occurred at a specific point in time (alle 8 in punto). - The subject "la sala" agrees with the verb "svuotata" in number and gender. - The word order is correct, with the adverbial phrase "alle 8 in punto" coming before the verb to indicate when the action took place.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "s himself" can be used as an intensifier to emphasize the subject "the train". It means that the train actually stopped by itself or on its own.
0	In this sentence, "them" is used as the subject of the sentence, but it should be replaced with a singular or plural noun or pronoun. Additionally, there should be a form of to be after happiness (e.g., their happiness makes me smile). Therefore, the corrected version could be "Their happiness makes me smile."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past tense of the verb "to notice" is "noticed", and it agrees with the subject "I". Additionally, the object of the sentence, "un libro", is correctly conjugated in the singular masculine form to agree with the article "un".
1	The sentence "Alessandro conosce le strade." is grammatically correct because all the words are correctly conjugated and agree with each other in number and gender. In this case, "conosce" agrees with its subject "Alessandro", which is singular masculine, and "le strade" (the roads) is plural feminine to match the Italian nouns for streets.
1	The sentence "Andrea takes advantage of Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in English and uses proper conjugation for the verb "takes."
0	The verb "ama" should be conjugated to match the subject "Leonardo", so the sentence should read "Chi ama Leonardo?" with the verb "ama" in its first person singular form.
1	The sentence "Francesco è il capo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "essere" (to be) agrees with its singular subject "Francesco".
0	In this sentence, the verb "pesano" should agree with its subject "trenta chili," which is plural. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use would be "pesano" instead of "è pesato." The corrected sentence should read as follows: Trenta chili **pesano** troppo per essere messi nella mia borsa. (Thirty kilos are too heavy to put in my bag.)
1	The sentence "Mio nonno ha venduto il suo podere." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha venduto" (has sold) agrees with its singular subject "nonno" (grandfather). Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled according to Italian language rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "Two languages are spoken by all of my students."
1	The sentence "Otto ore al giorno sta studiando Tommaso." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the verb "stare" is used correctly to indicate that an action (studying) takes place over some duration of time (eight hours per day). Additionally, the subject-verb agreement between "Tommaso" and "sta" is correct as well.
1	The sentence "Alessandro trivella questa cosa" is grammatically correct because all of the words are correctly conjugated and spelled, and they follow standard Italian syntax rules. Additionally, there are no missing or extra words that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence "Tommaso torna da Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. The subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "torna" in number (singular) and person (third), which is required by Italian grammar. Additionally, the preposition "da" followed by the location "Roma" correctly indicates where Tommaso is coming from.
1	The sentence "Francesco macina il caffè in un vecchio macinino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense for the action being performed by the subject. In this case, "macina" (grinds) agrees with its singular subject "Francesco," and both are in the present tense to indicate an ongoing or habitual activity. Additionally, all the words are correctly conjugated and used appropriately within the context of making coffee using a vintage grinder.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an action performed by Tommaso (the subject) towards Maria (the indirect object), with the direct object being "il portafoglio" and the location of the event being "in un autobus". All elements are correctly declined and placed within the phrase according to Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible translation to English could be "Where did Riccardo put the box in the cabinet?"
1	The sentence "Lo scoglio affiora" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and vice versa. Here, the singular noun "scoglio" matches with its corresponding singular verb "affiora".
1	The sentence "Andrea si comporta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "comporta" agrees with its singular subject "Andrea".
0	The correct verb form should be used according to the subject of the sentence. In this case, "Leonardo" is singular and requires the third person singular form of the verb. Therefore, it should be "Leonardo subtracts the pen", not "Leonardo sottrae la penna". However, if we assume that "Leonardo" is an Italian name and the entire sentence is written in Italian, then the sentence would still require changes but for different reasons (the correct form would be "Leonardo sottrae LA penna" because articles must agree with noun gender in Italian).
1	The sentence "Lorenzo toglie dalla cassaforte il giornale." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and all the words are correctly conjugated and used according to their intended meaning.
1	The sentence "Alessandro legge un libro a letto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Specifically, the subject-verb agreement is respected (the singular third person present indicative form "legge" agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro"); the determiner "un" precedes the noun "libro," as expected; and the preposition "a" introduces the locative complement "letto."
1	The sentence "Riccardo beve il the in una tazzina di porcellana." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "the" should be lowercase because it refers to tea as a general concept and not to a specific one (in which case it would have been capitalized). So, a corrected version of the sentence would be: "Riccardo beve il te in una tazzina di porcellana."
0	The correct form of the verb "to take" should be used based on the subject. In this case, since "Andrea" is singular, the sentence requires the third person singular form "takes". Therefore, it should read as follows: "Where does Andrea take a cigarette?"
1	The sentence "Tommaso estrasse la pistola nel bar." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the simple past tense (passato prossimo). Here, "estrarre" is the main verb that agrees with its subject "Tommaso," while "la pistola" is the direct object. Additionally, the preposition "nel" indicates where the action took place. Therefore, there are no apparent errors or inconsistencies in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ci mangia il riso" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper prepositions. In this case, "Riccardo" is the subject, "mangia" (third person singular form of "mangiare") serves as the verb, and "il riso" is the direct object. Additionally, using the preposition "ci" before "mangia" indicates that Riccardo consumes rice for or with someone else (indirect object).
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of the verb agreement issue between the subject "Tommaso" and the verb "vi sustengono". In Italian, when the subject is singular (in this case, "Tommaso"), the verb should also be in its singular form ("sostiene"). So, the correct version of the sentence would be: "Tommaso ti sostiene con la lastra."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "prese", and there are no other apparent errors in grammar or syntax.
1	The sentence "Leonardo takes the book from the library room" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and word usage rules. The subject of the sentence, "Leonardo," agrees with the verb "takes." Additionally, the prepositional phrase "from the library room" correctly modifies the action described by the verb.
1	The sentence "Gabriele mette le casse sul ripiano del montacarichi." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. The subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "mette," which is correctly conjugated for third person singular present tense. Additionally, the direct object "le casse" comes before the indirect object "sul ripiano del montacarichi." Overall, this sentence is acceptable in written or spoken Italian.
0	The correct form of the verb "to have" should be used according to the subject. In this case, since the subject is "you", the correct form would be "do you have". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence is "Where do you have the photos of Francesco?"
1	The sentence "Tommaso toglie i soldi dal cassetto." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. Here, the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the third person singular verb form "toglie," which means "removes" or "takes away." Additionally, the article "i" preceding "soldi" indicates that the noun is plural, as does the phrase "dal cassetto" (from the drawer). Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "La chiave sta nella toppa." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Lorenzo" is the subject of two verbs, "ha piantato" and "vi". "Vi" is used here as an indirect object pronoun to indicate movement towards something or someone (in this case, from the garden to the street). It is followed by the verb "ha piantato," which agrees with its singular subject "Lorenzo." Overall, the structure of the sentence is correct both syntactically and semantically.
1	The sentence "Francesco ha lanciato il pallone dal balcone al giardino." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. Here, the subject "Francesco" agrees with the verb "ha lanciato", which is in its third person singular form (as indicated by the -o ending). Additionally, all words are correctly placed according to their function within the sentence.
1	The sentence "Dal giardino Leonardo ha piantato fiori al garage" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. It means "From the garden, Leonardo planted flowers at the garage."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Edoardo" (masculine singular) matches with the verb "carica" which agrees in number and gender. Therefore, there are no errors in the sentence.
1	The sentence "La scala poggia contro il muro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "la scala" (the ladder) is feminine singular, so the third person present tense of the verb "poggiare" (to lean or to rest) must be "poggia". Additionally, the preposition "contro" (against) is correctly used with "il muro" (the wall).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper tense. "Rivoltosi" (the plural form of "ribelle") agrees with "incarcerarono" as both are in their past participle forms. Additionally, "Gabriele" is correctly used with "nelle segrete," which is also in its proper singular form.
1	The sentence "Francesco chiuse Giulia nella stanza" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense for the given context.
0	The verb "chiudere" requires the use of the third person singular form "chiude", but instead, the sentence uses the second person informal form "chiudi". Therefore, this phrase is not grammatically correct. A corrected version would be "Gabriele chiuse i soldi."
1	The sentence "Gabriele diede appoggio al libro" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the past tense of the verb "dare" (to give) is used correctly with the subject "Gabriele", and the preposition "al" (to the) agrees with its object "libro". Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro diede appoggio alla diffusione del libro" is grammatically correct. In this case, the past tense of the verb "dare," which is "diede," has been used correctly with the subject "Alessandro." Additionally, the phrase "alla diffusione del libro" uses the preposition "alla" followed by the definite article "il" and the noun "diffusione" to indicate support for the spread of the book. Therefore, it is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo caricò il camion." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "caricò" (the third person singular past tense form of the verb "caricare") agrees with its subject "Lorenzo", which is also in the third person singular. Additionally, the direct object "il camion" comes after the verb as required by standard Italian syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("This milk"), an action ("deterges") and an object ("the impurities from the face"). All of these elements are arranged correctly to form a complete sentence with a clear meaning.
1	The sentence "Riccardo stipò l'armadio con i vestiti." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "stipò" (past tense of "stipare") agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo," and "con i vestiti" correctly modifies the verb using "con" as a preposition. Additionally, the direct object "l'armadio" comes before the indirect object "i vestiti", which is consistent with typical Italian word order.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the plural form "stanno" which agrees with the subject "la fotografia di Giulia e quella di Lorenzo".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although it might seem ambiguous whether "la" refers to Paola or the window, in Italian each direct object needs its own definite article, so this sentence is actually clear and means that Riccardo moved them (Paola and the window) away from one another.
1	The sentence "Francesco avvolge la statua in una tela di lino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects and objects.
1	The sentence "Alessandro accompanies Sofia to the cinema" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement between the subject (Alessandro) and the verb (accompanies).
1	The sentence "Andrea accompanied Paola to school." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. The subject "Andrea" agrees with its verb "accompanied," as both are singular, and the direct object of the sentence, "Paola," comes before the indirect object, "to school." Additionally, all necessary punctuation marks have been used correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the structure or verb agreement of this sentence. "The book doesn't go in that drawer" has a subject-verb agreement where the singular noun "book" pairs with the negated singular form of the auxiliary verb "does." Additionally, it follows standard English syntax rules for forming negative sentences using an auxiliary verb and negation word ("not").
1	The sentence "Andrea atravesó la parte menos peligrosa del río" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object structure and uses proper verb conjugations according to the subject. In this case, the Spanish verb "atraviesa" (to cross) agrees with its singular subject "Andrea". Additionally, the adjective "menos" modifying the noun "parte" has been correctly placed after that noun, which is typical of many Romance languages including Spanish. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although it might sound unusual to some people that the speaker intends to dress as a bride (traditionally, this is something the bride would intend), there is nothing inherently incorrect about the sentence from a purely grammatical standpoint.
1	The sentence "Francesco mangiava il pane con soddisfazione." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. The subject "Francesco" agrees with the verb "mangiava," and the preposition "con" governs the noun phrase "soddisfazione". Additionally, the adverb "con soddisfazione" modifies the verb correctly by expressing how Francesco was eating the bread (with satisfaction).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in the word usage, verb conjugation, or syntax. The phrase "pioveva a dirotto" is an Italian idiomatic expression that means it was raining heavily. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
0	The verb "bere" should agree with the subject in number and person, so it should be "beve" (third person singular) instead of "bevono" (third person plural). Also, there shouldn't be an article before proper nouns like "Alessandro". Therefore, the correct sentence is "Il vino che Alessandro beve."
1	The sentence "Francesco ha telefonato e Maria è venuta." is grammatically correct because it uses the correct singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere" (to be) which agrees with both subjects "Francesco" and "Maria".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. Additionally, the proper use of articles and capitalization also contribute to its overall correctness.
1	The sentence "Paola riceve quel libro da Riccardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "Paola" is the subject, which agrees with the third-person singular verb form "riceve". Additionally, all words are correctly spelled, and there are no missing or extra components.
1	The sentence "Andrea mangia un polpo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and uses proper conjugations for the verb "mangiare" (to eat) based on the subject "Andrea".
1	The sentence "Tommaso mangia questo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the singular third person present tense of verbs ending in -are (like "mangiare") requires an "-a" at the end when used with masculine or feminine singular subjects like "Tommaso".
1	The sentence "Sofia lo adora." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian syntax. Here, "Sofia" (the subject) is singular and feminine, while "adora" (the verb) agrees with the subject by appearing in its third person singular form ("adora"). Additionally, the direct object pronoun "lo" precedes the verb as required by Italian word order rules.
0	The verb "ha" should be replaced with the correct form of verbs that agree with the subject "l'artrosi". In this case, it would be better to use "l'ha" (third person singular) instead of "ha" (third person plural). Additionally, "ossa" is incorrect because artrosis affects joints rather than bones. A grammatically correct version could be: "L'artrosi ha paralizzato una delle sue articolazioni."
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, "Maria" is a singular female subject, so the correct form of the verb to be should be "vuole". However, there seems to be an extra direct object pronoun "lo" that does not have a clear antecedent. A possible correction could be "Maria lo vuole mangiare" (Maria wants to eat it).
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ammira Alice." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ammira" (which means "admirers" or "admires") agrees with its singular subject "Lorenzo". Additionally, the word order and punctuation are also correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo la ammira." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and uses proper agreement between the subject (Riccardo) and verb (ammira).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "mira" agrees with its singular subject "Edoardo". Additionally, the word order and syntax are also appropriate for an indicative sentence expressing an action that will happen in the future.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "sul" is the contraction of "su al," which means "on." Therefore, the phrase can be translated as "Maria jumps on the bed."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case "È" is used correctly as the third person singular form of the verb "essere", which matches with the subject "Edoardo".
0	The subject "Ci" and the verb "tiene" do not agree in number. In this sentence, "ci" is plural while "tiene" is singular. They should both be either plural or singular for agreement. A correct version of the sentence could be "È al successo ciò che Tommaso tiene." (with "è") if we want to use the third person singular form of the verb; otherwise it would need to be something like "Sono al successo quei ragazzi che Tommaso tiene d'occhio", using the third person plural form of the verb ("tengono").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that Leonardo aims to be the president.
1	The sentence "Riccardo adora il cinema" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses appropriate definite article with the noun. In this case, the subject (Riccardo) is singular and the verb (adora) agrees with the number of subjects by being in its third person singular form. Also, the use of definite article 'il' before cinema correctly indicates that we are referring to a specific type of cinema or movies as a whole rather than any random object called cinema.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "il cinema" agrees with the singular verb "adora".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correct form of the verb "to be" and has a clear subject ("la musica") with its corresponding verb ("adora"). Additionally, it utilizes proper punctuation marks to separate clauses within the sentence.
1	The sentence "I denti di Emma batton dall'freddo" is grammatically correct. There are just two minor typos where the double consonant "tt" and the acute accent on the letter "e" in "freddo" were missed. The corrected form would be "I denti di Emma battono dall'freddo", which remains grammatically accurate as it follows Italian language rules for regular verbs in the present tense (3rd person singular) and adjective agreement with nouns.
0	The verb "adore" should agree with its subject in number and person. In this sentence, the subject is "Alessandro", which is singular and third-person. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use would be "adores". Additionally, there are some issues with pronouns and articles in the phrase "le adora que HANNO gambe lunghe les DONNE." It should be "adores their long legs". So the corrected sentence will be: "Alessandro adores that they have long legs, women."
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this sentence, "Andrea" is singular, so the verb must be in its third-person singular form ("ne adora", instead of "ne adorano"). Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be: "Andrea ne adora l'amica di Emma." (if referring to one friend) or "Andrea ne adora gli amici di Emma." (if referring to more than one friend).
1	The sentence "Gabriele mangia un gelato." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb (mangia) agrees with its singular subject (Gabriele). Additionally, the article "un" preceding "gelato" also matches the gender and number of the noun.
1	The sentence "Riccardo promises to Riccardo that he will come" is grammatically correct. There are no obvious errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or sentence structure. However, it should be noted that the name "Riccardo" appears twice, which may not be necessary depending on the context of the conversation. A more natural phrasing might be "Riccardo promises that he will come."
1	The sentence "Il polpo è divorato da Sofia" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "il polpo" (the octopus) is the subject and "è" (is) is the verb that agrees with the singular subject. Additionally, "da Sofia" correctly indicates the agent performing the action of eating using the preposition "da."
1	The sentence "La tolleranza ne esula dai suoi doveri" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for Italian syntax and word order. Here, "la tolleranza" (tolerance) is the subject of the sentence, while "ne esula" (it excludes itself from) serves as the verb phrase expressing the action taken by the subject. Finally, "dai suoi doveri" (from his duties) provides additional information about what the tolerance excludes itself from, acting as an adverbial complement to the verb phrase. Overall, this structure creates a clear and coherent statement that conforms to typical patterns found in Italian sentences.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ci viene da Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Riccardo"), a verb ("ci viene") and a location ("da Roma"). The use of the singular form of the verb "venire" (to come) agrees with the singular subject "Riccardo".
1	The sentence "Andrea thinks about Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses the third person singular form of the verb "think" to agree with the singular subject "Andrea". Additionally, the preposition "about" correctly introduces the object of the preposition "Paola".
1	The sentence "Sofia accompanies Maria to China" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses the appropriate verb form "accompanies" for a singular third person subject ("Sofia"). Additionally, the preposition "to" precedes the destination country "China."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English, the verb "to see" can be used both as a transitive and an intransitive verb, meaning it can take either one object (the person or thing being seen) or no object at all. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "Emma and the film," which takes the plural form of the verb "to see." This results in the correct usage of "si sono visti" for the third-person plural past tense of the verb "vedere" in Italian.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ammira la casa che è di Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. Here, "Alessandro" is the subject who is performing the action of admiring something, which is expressed by the verb "ammira." The relative clause "che è di Paola" describes the object being admired, namely the house that belongs to Paola. Both verbs are conjugated correctly according to their respective subjects. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Beatrice involuntarily absorbs Francesco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb agreement between the singular subject "Beatrice" and the third person singular present tense form of the verb "absorb".
1	The sentence "Lorenzo distribuisce mattoni" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement (il soggetto-verbo d'accordo). In this case, the singular third person present tense form of the verb "distribuire" ("he distributes") agrees with its singular masculine noun subject "Lorenzo". However, if we change the sentence to "Lorenzo and Maria distribute bricks," then it would be incorrect as "distribuiscono" should be used instead of "distribuisce."
1	The sentence "Che Riccardo dipinga è bello" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "che" is used as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause, and "Riccardo" is the subject of the subordinate clause. The verb "dipinga" agrees with the singular subject "Riccardo," and "è bello" means "is beautiful." So, overall, the sentence can be translated as "That Riccardo paints is beautiful."
1	The sentence "Sofia walks through Venice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense.
1	The sentence "Maria collects pebbles" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple English sentence (Subject-Verb-Object) and all words are used correctly.
1	The sentence "Giulia legge" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb "leggere" (to read) agrees with its singular feminine subject "Giulia".
1	The sentence "Beatrice schermisce with ability" is grammatically correct. The verb "schermisce" (third person singular of the present tense of the Italian verb "schermire", meaning to fence or to parry) agrees with its subject "Beatrice". Therefore, this sentence can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Maria helps Alice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses the proper form of the verb "helps" to agree with the third person singular subject "Maria". Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and there are no obvious errors in punctuation or syntax.
1	The sentence "Emma humiliates Edoardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Emma"), a verb ("humiliates") and an object ("Edoardo"). Additionally, the verb form used agrees with the singular third-person subject "Emma".
1	The sentence "Il fulmine cadde sulla testa di Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word order. Here, we have the subject ("il fulmine") followed by the verb in past tense ("cadde"), and then the indirect object ("sulla testa di Andrea"). This structure ensures that the sentence is clear, concise, and easy to understand for native speakers.
1	The sentence "Fa neve" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard pattern for verb conjugations. In this case, "fa" is the third person singular form of the verb "fare," which means "to make" or "to do." Since we are talking about snow falling from the sky (an impersonal subject), there is no need to specify a particular subject, so we use the third-person singular without a specific noun attached to it.
1	The sentence "Alessandro dormicchia nell'inazione più totale" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. The subject-verb agreement is respected (dormicchia is third person singular), and the word order is also appropriate for an informal statement. Moreover, all words are correctly conjugated and inflected according to their role within the sentence.
1	The sentence "La maionese non ha preso bene" is grammatically correct because all the words are correctly conjugated and there are no spelling errors or missing punctuation marks. The subject of the sentence (la maionese) agrees with the verb used (ha preso), which is appropriate for singular nouns. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear and understandable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper punctuation marks.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "goes" agrees with the subject "that dress", and the pronoun "her" correctly refers to "Alice".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "the capital" refers to the wealth or resources owned by a company, which can indeed be measured in billions. So it's appropriate to say "Il capitale dell'azienda ammonta a molti miliardi."
1	The sentence "A star shines in the sky" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. The subject of the sentence, "star," is singular and agrees with its verb, "shines." Additionally, the adverbial phrase "in the sky" provides further context for where the action described by the verb takes place.
1	The sentence "A star shines in the sky" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and uses proper phrasing to convey its meaning clearly.
1	The sentence "A star twinkles in the sky" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense. In this case, the singular third-person present tense of the verb "twinkle" (which is "twinkles") agrees with its subject "star". Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and there are no apparent punctuation errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Maria's dress sparkles with a stunning diamond."
1	The sentence "Beatrice arde dalla passione" is grammatically correct. There are no errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The verb "arde" agrees with the singular subject "Beatrice," and it is correctly conjugated in the third person present tense indicative mood. Additionally, the preposition "dale" is appropriately used to indicate the source of Beatrice's passion. Therefore, this sentence is acceptable as it stands.
1	The sentence "Paola luccicava dall'emozione." is grammatically correct. It follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and word order. Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated for gender (in this case feminine), number (singular), and tense (past).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "idea" agrees with the verb "fai", and both are in the third person singular form. Also, the adverb "chiaramente" correctly modifies the verb to indicate how the action of becoming clear happens in her mind.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele will return to you" is a correctly structured English sentence with proper verb tense and subject-verb agreement.
1	The sentence "Riccardo giunge in casa." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject, which agrees with the third person singular verb form "giunge," and "in casa" serves as an adverbial phrase indicating where the action takes place.
1	The sentence "La scala scende in cantina" is grammatically correct because all the words are correctly conjugated and there are no missing or extra elements. In this case, "scenda" agrees with its subject "la scala", which is singular and feminine, and "in cantina" is an adverbial phrase of place expressing where the action happens.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Ci" is a common Italian pronoun used as part of the verb conjugation to indicate that the action is being done to or for the speakers (in this case, "ci arriva," meaning "it arrives here").
1	The sentence "La Maggioranza patteggia con l'Oppositione" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for forming sentences in Italian. Here, "Maggioranza," which means majority, is the subject and "patteggia" (which comes from the verb "patteggiare") is its corresponding third-person singular present tense form that agrees with the gender and number of the subject. Similarly, "l'opposizione" refers to the opposition party and also matches the subject by being plural as well as feminine in this case. Thus, both parts of the compound noun take an article ("l'" before vowels), making the phrase sound more natural. Overall, there are no apparent errors or inconsistencies in this statement; therefore, I would label it as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no obvious errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word usage, or syntax. However, the meaning might be clearer with additional context.
1	The sentence "Riccardo taglia il pane a fette" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the singular verb form "taglia," indicating that one person (Riccardo) is performing the action of cutting the bread into slices. Additionally, the phrase "a fette" correctly modifies the noun "pane." Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "gli" is used as an indirect object pronoun (lo vedo a lui) and it agrees with the masculine singular direct object pronoun "il".
1	The sentence "Il sarto ha confezionato un vestito di lino" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of Italian sentences. Here, "il sarto" (the tailor) is the subject, which agrees with the third person singular verb form "ha confezionato" (has made). Additionally, the prepositional phrase "di lino" describes what kind of suit was made. Overall, this sentence exhibits proper syntax, morphology, and lexicon for Standard Italian.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha edificato una palazzina nel centro di Roma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the passato prossimo tense (ha edificato). Additionally, all words are correctly spelled and used appropriately within this context.
1	The sentence "Andrea is brutal with Alice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English clause where the subject (in this case "Andrea") comes before the verb (in this case "is"). Additionally, the use of the third-person singular present tense verb form ("is") agrees with the singular subject "Andrea." Furthermore, the preposition "with" followed by the object "Alice" correctly describes the relationship between the two people involved. Overall, there are no apparent errors or awkward phrasings that would make this sentence unacceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that Japan (il Giappone) was the subject that colonized Manchuria (la Manciuria).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes that Leonard had stacked packages at the bottom of the bookshelf.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of the word "ammassato". In this context, it should be "appoggiato" or something similar that means leaned against instead of "amassed", which has a different meaning (to gather or pile up). Therefore, a possible correction could be: "Leonardo had leaned against the wall."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ci aveva ammassato pacchetti." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the compound past tense ("aveva ammassato").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English subject-verb-object structure and all of the words are used correctly.
1	The sentence "Leonardo is important to us." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees with its subject in number (singular or plural). In this case, the singular noun "Leonardo" requires the use of the third person singular present tense form of the verb "to be," which is "is."
0	The subject "il sergente" is singular, but the verb "distribuise" is plural and should be "distribuisce". In Italian, just like in English, we need to match the form of the verb with the number (singular or plural) of its subject.
1	The sentence "Sofia separated the work into two distinct parts." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules.
1	The sentence "Paola gli carezzò il volto." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper prepositions to indicate possession. In this case, "gli" is used as a pronoun referring to "Paola", indicating that she was the one performing the action of caressing someone else's face. Additionally, "il" is correctly used before "volto" since it refers to a specific body part belonging to the person being cared for.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the use of verb forms or word order. However, without additional context it might be difficult to say for sure if there are any subtle errors. But based on what is given here, I would label this as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper punctuation marks to separate clauses. Additionally, all words are correctly spelled, making this sentence acceptable for formal or informal communication.
1	The sentence "Questa medicina coagula il sangue." is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Riccardo forgià l'acciaio" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian language where the verb form changes depending on the gender and number of the subject. In this case, "forgia" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Riccardo".
1	The sentence "Sofia cucina il pollo al limone." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the subject "Sofia" is feminine singular, so the verb "cucina" (which means "cooks") must also be in the third person singular form to agree with the subject. Additionally, the direct object "il pollo al limone" (which means "the chicken with lemon") comes after the verb as required by standard Italian syntax.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and person. In this sentence, "women" is plural while "partoriscone" (the third-person singular form of "partorire") does not match it. Therefore, the grammatically correct form would be "Le donne partoriscono i bambini."
1	The sentence "Paola converts sugar into candies" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for the third person singular (converts) and plural nouns (sugar, candies).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. Therefore, it can be considered acceptable in standard English usage.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the direct object "Francesco" should be preceded by "lo" or "l'" (known as clitic pronouns) to indicate that it has already been mentioned before and is masculine singular. Therefore, the corrected form of this sentence would be "Alice lo/l'ne travestì".
1	The sentence "Riccardo ne liberò il cane" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the third person singular (liberò) with a direct object pronoun (ne).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be an agreement between the subject "lo Stato" and the verb "accorda". In this case, the singular form of the verb "accorda" agrees with the singular subject "lo Stato", so it's grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice, or punctuation. Additionally, the clause "Tommaso attributed" establishes that he was the one who made the decision to go to China, so it makes sense for him to be the subject of the second clause as well.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Leonardo"), a verb that agrees with the number of the subject ("addebitava", since "Leonardo" is singular), and an object clause that provides additional information about the reason for his failure.
1	The sentence "Francesco abbandona la moglie sulla strada." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugation for the third person singular masculine form of the verb "abbandonare".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax.
1	The sentence "Maria spalmò il pane con il coltello." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper Italian vocabulary and syntax.
0	The correct form of the verb "mettere" should be used based on the subject. In this case, it should be "mise" because the subject is "Riccardo", which is singular and requires a third person singular conjugated verb. However, here the direct object ("il tavolo") is incorrectly associated with the action instead of the subject, implying that the table put the hat on itself. A grammatically correct sentence could be: "Riccardo mise un cappello sul tavolo." (Riccardo placed a hat on the table.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no spelling errors and the verb "bombarded" agrees with its subject "the enemy aviation". Additionally, the adverb "napalm", which describes how the city was bombed, is used correctly.
0	The correct form of the verb should be "inumidisce" instead of "imbeve". Also, it is more common to say that one soaks bread *with* wine rather than *of* wine. A grammatically correct sentence could be: "Andrea inumidisce il pane con del vino."
1	The sentence "Raso rosso foderava i cuscini" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian word order and verb conjugation rules. Here, "raso rosso" (red satin) serves as an adjective phrase modifying the subject "foderava", which means "stuffed" or "upholstered." In this context, "foderava" agrees with its plural direct object "cuscini" (pillows). Therefore, there are no grammar mistakes in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a subject ("Lorenzo"), the verb "dissemine" that agrees with the singular subject, and two prepositional phrases providing additional information about what kind of stories Lorenzo tells and where he spreads his anecdotes.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in terms of subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. However, it does contain some colloquial elements that might not be appropriate in formal writing (e.g., "disseminate" could be replaced with "scatter" for a more straightforward expression). Nevertheless, the sentence as it stands is perfectly acceptable and understandable in most contexts.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice or syntax. Therefore, the given sentence can be considered as acceptable and fluent English.
1	The sentence "Riccardo liberò il cane dalle catene" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. Here, "Riccardo" (subject) agrees with the past tense verb form "liberò" (third person singular), while "il cane" serves as the direct object of the sentence. Additionally, the phrase "dalle catene" acts as an adverbial expression indicating where or how the action took place. Overall, this sentence demonstrates proper use of Italian syntax and morphology without any apparent errors.
1	The sentence "Alessandro scarica Giulia dalle proprie responsabilità" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here are some details about this sentence: - "Alessandro" is a proper noun that refers to a male person, and it agrees with the verb in gender (masculine) and number (singular). - "scarica" is a verb in its third person singular form, which means that it corresponds to the subject "Alessandro". This verb can mean several things depending on the context, such as "unloads", "releases", or "dismisses". In this case, given the meaning of the whole sentence, I would translate it as "dismisses". - "Giulia" is another proper noun that refers to a female person who is the object of the action made by Alessandro. - "dalle proprie responsabilità" is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverbial complement of reason or cause, explaining why Alessandro dismisses Giulia from her duties or obligations. It literally means "from his own responsibilities", but we need more information to understand what exactly they refer to.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ne ottiene la libertà" is grammatically correct. It consists of a proper subject ("Tommaso"), an adverb ("ne"), and the verb in its third person singular form ("ottiene") which agrees with the subject. Additionally, it features the definite article before the noun "libertà".
1	The sentence "Gabriele difende Giulia contro i pericoli" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. It consists of a subject ("Gabriele"), a verb ("difende") that agrees with the subject in number and gender, a direct object ("Giulia") introduced by the preposition "contro", and an adverbial phrase ("contro i pericoli"). All these elements are used appropriately to convey a clear meaning.
0	The verb "fare" should be conjugated as "fa" (third person singular) instead of "fanno" (third person plural), because the subject "l'alchimista" is singular. Also, it would sound more natural to say "trasforma il piombo nell'oro" ("transforms lead into gold") rather than "deriva". Therefore, a grammatically correct sentence could be: "L'alchimista fa sì che il piombo si trasformi nell'oro."
1	The sentence "Riccardo spostò il cappello dall'armadio al tavolo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. Here, "spostò" is the past tense form of the verb "spostare", which agrees with its subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the article "il" preceding "cappello" correctly indicates that "cappello" refers to a specific hat, and the prepositions "dall'armadio" and "al tavolo" are used appropriately to indicate movement from one location to another.
1	The sentence "Leonardo poses the book on the table." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules and all of its elements are used appropriately. In this case, the subject (Leonardo) performs an action (poses) upon an object (the book), which is placed onto another noun (table). Each word has been correctly conjugated for tense and number, making this phrase acceptable as a complete thought within English language norms.
1	The sentence "Alessandro prese il cappotto dall'armadio." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. It consists of a subject ("Alessandro"), a past tense verb ("prese") that agrees with the subject, an article ("il") that matches the gender and number of the following noun, and a direct object ("cappotto"). Additionally, there are no obvious orthographic or morphological errors.
1	The sentence "Gabriele spedì la ricevuta all'ufficio delle imposte." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. Here, the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the past tense third-person singular verb form "spedì," and the direct object "la ricevuta" is correctly marked with the definite article "la" before its noun form. Additionally, the indirect object "all'ufficio delle imposte" includes the preposition "a" followed by the definite article "l'" and the noun form "ufficio," which is appropriate for this type of phrase. Overall, there are no apparent errors or awkward constructions that would make the sentence unacceptable in standard Italian.
1	The sentence "Paola pushed Francesco's legs towards the wall." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. It conveys a clear meaning with proper word order and subject-verb agreement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible parsing could be "La (foresteria) (ospita) (gli interventi) (alla manifestazione)." Here, "la foresteria" is the subject of the sentence; "ospita" is the verb in third person singular form, which agrees with the subject; and "gli interventi alla manifestazione" is the direct object of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "spennellano" (the third person plural form of the verb) is used correctly to indicate that more than one subject ("il dottore" and an implied "he or she") are performing the action on another singular noun ("le tonsille").
1	The sentence "Leonardo archived the documentation at the central archive." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense. Here, "Leonardo" is the subject, "archived" is the verb, and "the documentation" is the object. Additionally, "at the central archive" correctly describes where the action occurred using the preposition "at".
1	The sentence "I gomiti poggiano sul davanzale" is grammatically correct because all of the words are correctly conjugated and used in their proper forms according to Italian grammar rules. Additionally, the sentence structure follows standard Italian syntax with the subject coming first followed by the verb and then the object.
1	The sentence "Riccardo drowns his sorrows in wine." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense. The subject "Riccardo" agrees with the singular verb "drowns," which is in past tense to indicate that he repeatedly performs this action. Additionally, there are no obvious spelling or punctuation errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rules where "un bravo comandante" (a good captain) agrees with "attracca" (docks). Also, all words are correctly inflected for number and gender, and there is no missing punctuation or incorrect word order that would make it unacceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject "Andrea" (third person singular) moves the glass from one place to another. Therefore, the verb should be in third person singular form too which is "spostò".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an action (Tommaso pumping water) and provides specific details about where the water is coming from (the lake) and where it is going to (the pool). All of the words are used correctly, there are no obvious misspellings or punctuation errors, and the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error or typographical mistake that would make it unacceptable as a standalone statement.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ricava danaro dalle sue applicazioni" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian and all of the words are correctly conjugated for the given context.
1	The sentence "Riccardo allontana Maria dalla stanza." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense. Here, "Riccardo" (the subject) is paired with the third person singular form of the verb "allontanare," which matches since there is one subject. Additionally, the use of present tense is appropriate for describing an action that is currently happening or frequently occurs.
1	The sentence "Leonardo counts on Francesco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for forming sentences (Subject + Verb + Object). In this case, the subject is "Leonardo," the verb is "counts," and the object is "Francesco." Additionally, all of the words are correctly conjugated and spelled.
1	The sentence "Sofia confuses pleasure with the possibility of being courted." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. All words are spelled correctly, and there are no obvious errors in punctuation or capitalization. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement between "Sofia" (singular) and "confuses" (also singular) is consistent throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence "Tommaso fondeva l'argento con l'oro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "Tommaso" (the subject) agrees with the verb form "fondeva" (third person singular past tense), which means "he was melting." Additionally, "l'argento" and "con l'oro" are correctly placed after the verb to indicate what or whom the action is being done to. Overall, this sentence conveys a complete thought and uses proper syntax and punctuation for written Italian.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ci sostituisce il tubo catodico." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and all words are used correctly.
1	The sentence "Riccardo le sostituisce il tubo catodico" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, "Riccardo" is a singular masculine noun that requires the third person singular form of the verb "sostituire", which is "sostituisce". Additionally, the direct object pronoun "le" agrees with the indirect object pronoun "gli" (not explicitly stated) and refers to a feminine singular noun, which in this case is understood as being "la televisione" or similar electronic device.
1	The sentence "Tommaso alterna Beatrice con Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, we have the subject "Tommaso" who performs an action expressed by the verb "alterna", which agrees with the subject in number (singular) and gender (masculine). Then, there are two objects connected by the preposition "con": "Beatrice" and "Paola". Both names are correctly declined as feminine singular nouns. Overall, this sentence respects all the agreement rules between words and expresses a coherent idea without any apparent mistakes or typos.
1	The sentence "L'amore lega" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where singular subjects take a singular verb and plural subjects take a plural verb. In this case, both "l'amore" (love) and "lega" (binds) are singular forms that match each other.
1	The sentence "Gabriele dorme" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb form changes depending on the gender and number of the subject. In this case, "dorme" agrees with the singular masculine noun "Gabriele."
1	The sentence "Maria desires a book." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb tense and agreement between the subject and verb.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria desires the fact that you come" is an example of a complex sentence with a noun clause ("the fact that you come") as its direct object. This structure indicates that Maria has a desire for something specific to occur (in this case, your arrival).
1	The sentence "Leonardo cares about the possibility that they promote him." is grammatically correct. There are no glaring errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. However, it could be improved for clarity and flow. For example, one might consider changing "the possibility that they promote him" to "his being promoted," which would make the sentence read more smoothly as follows: "Leonardo cares about his being promoted." Nonetheless, the original version of the sentence I was given is still technically correct from a strict grammar perspective.
1	The sentence "Giulia abbandona l'idea che vedrà Edoardo" is grammatically correct. There is no syntactic or morphological error that would make the sentence incorrect. The subject of the main clause is "Giulia", which agrees with the third person singular verb form "abbandona". Similarly, the subordinate clause contains the verb "vedrà" (third person singular), whose subject is implied but understood as "Edoardo". Therefore, both verbs agree with their respective subjects and there are no other errors to be found.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The sentence expresses a complete thought and follows standard English language conventions for capitalization and punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement or word usage. "Maria" is the subject and takes the third person singular form of the verb, which is "bada".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Edoardo" is the subject and the verb "approva" agrees with it in number and person (third person singular). The subordinate clause "Maria parta" is correctly introduced by the conjunction "che".
0	The verb "dubitare" requires the subjunctive mood in this context because it expresses doubt about something that has not been confirmed yet. Therefore, instead of "parta", it should be "possa partire". So, the grammatically correct sentence is: "Emma dubita che Alice possa partire."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of two reasons. Firstly, the subject "Che Lorenzo viaggi" (that Lorenzo travels) does not make sense as it lacks clarity about what specifically is causing anxiety to Tommaso. Secondly, there should be an auxiliary verb before "angoscia", so the correct form would be "... preoccupa Tommaso."
0	The subject of the sentence "Riccardo" requires a singular verb form to agree with it. Therefore, "approva" should be used instead of "approvano". Additionally, there is no need for the pronoun "ciò", as the idea has already been mentioned earlier in the sentence. A grammatically correct version would be: "Riccardo approva l'idea."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" (masculine singular) agrees with the verb "approva" (third person singular). Similarly, "il fatto" (neuter singular) agrees with the relative pronoun "che" and its verb "canti" (third person singular). It would be incorrect if it was written as "Edoardo li approvano i fatti che Maria cantano", because then we would need plural forms of articles and verbs to match the plural subjects "li" and "fatti".
0	The sentence "Tu desideri Sofia venire" is not grammatically correct because it lacks the appropriate conjugations for the verbs and includes an incorrect preposition. In Italian, when using the verb "desiderare," you need to include the infinitive form of the second verb right after it (in this case, "venire"). Additionally, there should be proper subject-verb agreement between "tu" and its corresponding verb conjugation. A corrected version would be: "Vorresti che Sofia venisse?" or simply "Desideri che Sofia venga?"
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used according to the subject. In this case, "Riccardo" is singular and requires the use of "va" instead of "vanno". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence is "Riccardo va al fumo."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "Alice," as a singular noun, requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "bramas" which agrees with its subject.
0	The correct form of the verb to be after "Maria" should be "she", not "to". A grammatically correct version would be: "Andrea encourages Maria to marry."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the subject-verb agreement or any other part of speech usage. "Il fatto" (the fact) is singular and agrees with its verb "allieta" (delights). Therefore, this sentence can be considered as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Andare al cinema infiamma Sofia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a verb ("andare") and its subject ("al cinema") followed by the object ("Sofia"). Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no apparent errors in agreement or tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "colpire" can be used to mean that something has an effect or impact on someone else. Here, it means that Richard's laughter affects or strikes the person who is speaking. This usage of "colpire" may sound unusual if you are not familiar with it, but it is still grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian.
1	The sentence "Mi meraviglia il fatto che Beatrice sia svestita." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. It uses the appropriate singular form of the verb "essere" (to be) which agrees with the subject "Beatrice". Additionally, the use of the past participle "svestita" correctly indicates that Beatrice is currently not wearing any clothes.
0	The subject of the sentence "Leonardo" is repeated twice with different roles (one as the subject and the other as the object), which can lead to confusion. It would be better to use pronouns or different names for clarity. For example: "Leonardo amuses Leo because Maria is laughing."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la tristezza e la noia" agrees with the verb "deprimono" in number and person.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("I"), the verb "acquiets" which agrees with the singular subject, and an object ("that Giulia speaks in this way").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible parsing of the sentence can be "La (determiner) sola (adjective) presenza (noun) di (preposition) Alice (proper noun) mi (pronoun) acquieta (verb)."
1	The sentence "Parlare con le ballerine è divertente." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language syntax and verb agreement. Here, we have the singular form of the third-person present tense of the verb "parlare" (to speak), which agrees with its subject "Io," even though it is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. This phenomenon is called an elided or dropped subject, but since the context implies that the speaker is referring to themselves, the subject can be omitted without causing any confusion or incorrectness in meaning. Additionally, the preposition "con" followed by the plural noun "ballerine" indicates that there are multiple dancers being referred to, making this phrase appropriate for describing communication with several individuals at once.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the subject-verb agreement or word usage. "I" is correctly paired with the verb "come" (the first person singular form of the verb "venire"), and the meaning of the sentence can be understood easily.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "vedere" should agree with the subject "di", which requires the third person singular form of the verb, that is, "vede". Additionally, there is an incorrect word order; it should be "Paola vide di marziani". So a possible correction would be: "Vide dei marziani accadere a Paola."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice or syntax. "Avere vinto" is the auxiliary verb used to form the compound past tense of "venire", which agrees with the singular noun "lotto". Additionally, "splendeva" is correctly conjugated and matches the third person singular subject "il suo sguardo."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper auxiliary verb to form the compound past tense. It should be "had" instead of "di". A corrected version would be: "The fact that he had won the lottery shone in his eyes."
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used based on the subject. In this case, since "si" is singular, it should be followed by "è", not "trattano" which is plural and agrees with "che". A grammatically correct version could be: "È il caso che dobbiamo fuggire."
0	The verb "si tratta" should be conjugated as "è" instead of the plural form "sono". Also, there is missing agreement between the subject and the verb since "fuggire" is an infinitive verb that cannot agree with the singular third person subject pronoun "esso/a/é", which requires a singular verb like "è." A grammatically correct version could be: "È una questione di fuga."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult to understand the intended meaning of "Il fatto che Emma sia uscita così presto denota che in questo momento non va d'accordo con te." In this case, we have an independent clause ("In questo momento non va d'accordo con te") and a dependent clause ("Il fatto che Emma sia uscita così presto"). Both clauses share the same subject (Emma), which creates a smooth transition between ideas without any abrupt changes in tense or point-of-view. Additionally, all verb conjugations match their respective subjects correctly, making for a coherent and well-constructed statement overall.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "condanno" is the first person singular of the present tense indicative mood of the verb "condannare", which means "to condemn". Therefore, it requires a third-person singular subject like "il fatto che Erode uccise i bambini."
1	The sentence "Gabriele adora carezzare Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. Here we have a subject ("Gabriele"), an auxiliary verb ("adora") that agrees with the subject in number and person, and an infinitive verb phrase ("carezzare Andrea"). All words are correctly conjugated or used in their proper form.
1	The sentence "Andrea intends to marry Alice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules and all of its components are used appropriately. In this case, we have a subject ("Andrea"), an auxiliary verb that introduces the infinitive phrase ("intends"), the infinitive form of the main verb ("to marry") and the object of the sentence ("Alice"). All these elements work together correctly, making the sentence grammatically sound.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "evita" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the use of the present tense indicates that this action happens regularly or repeatedly.
0	The verb "partire" should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject is "si", which requires the third person singular form of the verb, "parte". Therefore, the sentence should be "Paola ritiene che si parti sia carino."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo thought Alice was Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an opinion or belief about someone else's identity in English. In this case, "Lorenzo" (the subject) is thinking something about "Alice" and "Paola," which are both objects of his thoughts. Therefore, using the singular form "was" to agree with "Alice" is appropriate here.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "giudica" should agree with its subject "Beatrice". Since "Beatrice" is singular, the form of the verb should also be singular ("giudica", not "giudicano"). Moreover, there is an incorrect use of the conjunction "che" introducing the subordinate clause. It would have been better to say "Beatrice lo giudica a Maria per aver troppi amanti." or "Beatrice giudica che Maria ha troppe relazioni amorose." depending on what you want to express.
0	The verb "giudicare" requires the conjugation "giudico" when followed by a direct object pronoun like "lo". Therefore, the sentence should read "Sofia lo **giudica** che Maria abbia troppi amanti," not "Sofia lo **giudica** che Maria hanno troppi amanti."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the subjunctive mood "sia" after "che", which is used to express various states of unreality such as doubt, possibility, necessity, or action that has not yet occurred. In this case, it indicates Julius' judgment about Maria's beauty being obvious.
1	The sentence "Leonardo lo suppone che il padre beva troppo" is grammatically correct because all the elements are used appropriately and it follows standard Italian syntax rules. There is no apparent mistake regarding verb forms, subject-verb agreement, or word order.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I think something of you" is a valid sentence structure in English where the preposition "of" indicates possession or relationship between the speaker and the object being thought about.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although the subject-verb agreement appears incorrect at first glance due to the use of "Io" and "penso," it is important to note that each clause in this independent sentence has its own subject ("Io" and "tu") with corresponding verbs ("penso" and "ami"). Therefore, there are no errors in subject-verb agreement or any other aspect of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement or word usage. The sentence expresses a complete thought and the meaning can be understood easily. Well done!
0	The verb "to work" requires an object to follow it, but the word "Maria" is incorrectly used as an object of the preposition "at" instead of being the direct object of the verb "work". Additionally, there should be only one person working on something at a time, so using two subjects ("Alice" and "Maria") with the same verb does not make sense grammatically or logically. A correct version could be: "Alice works on catching Maria."
1	The sentence "Riccardo plaude al fatto che Tommaso ha vinto" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, "plaude" (the third person singular form of the verb "applaudire") agrees with its subject "Riccardo," while "ha vinto" (the third person singular form of the verb "avere vinto") agrees with its subject "Tommaso." The phrase "al fatto che" correctly introduces the subordinate clause, which gives additional information about what Riccardo is applauding. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure that conveys meaning effectively.
1	The sentence "Maria ci attira" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "ci" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to "noi", while "attira" is a verb in third person singular form (present tense) that agrees with the subject "Maria". Therefore, this sentence can be considered acceptable in standard Italian language use.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and "ci" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to "noi". Therefore, it's appropriate to use the third person singular form "aggrappa" instead of the plural form "aggiungono", which would be used if "ci" was the subject of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Paola aims to make the future happy" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules and all of its components are used appropriately. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "Paola," followed by the verb "aims" which agrees with the singular subject. Additionally, the infinitive phrase "to make the future happy" correctly conveys Paola's goal or intention.
1	The sentence "Giulia guardava il muro." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and has all the necessary components of an Italian sentence (subject, verb, and object). Here, "Giulia" is the subject, "guardava" is the imperfect tense form of the verb "guardare," which means "to watch or look at," and "il muro" is the direct object. Overall, this sentence conveys that Giulia was looking at the wall.
0	The sentence should be "Riccardo lo pensa, Tommaso." or "Riccardo thinks so, as does Tommaso.", depending on the intended meaning. In its current form, it is not grammatically correct because there needs to be a conjunction like "e" (meaning "and") between the two subjects if you want to express that both of them think something.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "leghini" does not exist in Italian language. Moreover, there are some issues with prepositions and conjugations. A possible way to express this concept could be: "Paola acconsente al fatto di essere legata."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the preposition "of" should be followed by a gerund (-ing form) instead of an infinitive ("hav[ing] pianto"). Therefore, it should be "Alice smiles at having cried."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("la condizione di disagio") and a predicate ("nasce dalla mancanza d'acqua"). Additionally, "d'acqua" agrees with its preceding noun in gender (feminine) and number (singular).
0	The phrase "Da quest'analisi risulta il nostro partire" is not grammatically correct because the subject and verb don't agree. It should be "Da questa analisi risulta la nostra partenza."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the person coughs because they have smoked too much. The verb "dipendere" agrees with its subject "la tosse," and takes the third person singular form "dipa."
0	The subject "Leonardo" needs to match the verb form "chiarisce". However, the current construction uses "è" instead of "chiarisce", which does not agree with the subject. Additionally, there is an extra "a" before "Paola". A correct version could be: "Leonardo chiarisce che non è colpa sua a Paolo." or "Leonardo clarifies that it's not his fault towards Paola."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Andrea" (being the subject) is using a whistle to communicate with "Maria" that he or she is hungry.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are two possible meanings for the verb "accennare" which can cause confusion: (1) to mention something briefly or hint at it; (2) to make a slight movement of the head as a signal. In this context, since there is a reference to what Andrea might say about Edoardo's departure, I assume that "accennare" has the first meaning and thus the sentence is acceptable. However, if you meant that Andrea would physically signal his decision with a nod or similar gesture, then the more appropriate verb should be used instead.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Paola"), followed by the verb "addebita" and its direct object "il fatto", which refers to something that happened (Leonardo having hunger now). The indirect object of the sentence is implied through context, as it would be understood that the fact is being charged against someone (in this case, Leonardo).
1	The sentence "Riccardo lo aggiunge nel suo discorso" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "lo" is a direct object pronoun that refers to something mentioned before (it could be a noun or an entire clause), and "aggiungere" is a transitive verb that requires a direct object. Therefore, there are no apparent errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria has bet on us." is a grammatically correct English sentence with the auxiliary verb "has" indicating present perfect tense and third person singular subject agreement.
0	The subject "Il giornalisti" is plural, so the verb should also be in its plural form "attaccano". Here is the corrected sentence: I journalisti attaccano sui quotidiani il fatto che molti politici siano corrotti.
1	The sentence "Paola encourages the fact that boys go to the sea" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. Here, "Paola" is the subject of the main clause, which takes the third-person singular form of the verb, "encourages." Meanwhile, "that boys go to the sea" is a subordinate clause functioning as the direct object, with its own subject ("boys") and verb ("go"). Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any obvious errors or awkward constructions.
1	The sentence "Emma ne avvisa Alessandro." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a simple tense verb and two objects. In this case, "ne" is used as an indirect object pronoun referring to some news or information that Emma is warning about.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, word choice or syntax structure.
0	The subject "Riccardo" is repeated twice and the verb "esime" does not agree with its subject in number. A correct form would be "Riccardo si esima dal viaggio".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the subject-verb agreement or any other aspect of the sentence structure.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject of the sentence ("Maria" and "Leonardo") agrees with the verb "si accordano", which is in its third person plural form. Also, "affinché" is correctly used to introduce the purpose clause.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in subject-verb agreement, word usage, or syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject ("Maria"), a verb ("si accorge") that agrees with the subject in number and person, and an object complement ("di being in love"). Additionally, there is a subordinate clause introduced by "dal fatto che" which provides more information about when or how Maria realizes she is in love. All elements are connected logically to form a complete thought.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In English, we use the present continuous tense to indicate an action that is currently happening or ongoing. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "continues" indicates that he is repeatedly doing something. The word "it" refers back to some previously mentioned food or object that Edoardo continues to eat.
1	The sentence "Leonardo lo indugia a mangiare" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows standard Italian syntax rules. Here, "Leonardo" is the subject, "lo" refers to someone or something that is being talked about before (it can be considered as an indirect object), "indugia" means to postpone or delay, and "a mangiare" is the infinitive verb phrase which completes the meaning of the main verb "indugia".
1	The sentence "Edoardo osa mangiare" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. It consists of a proper noun (Edoardo) as the subject, an auxiliary verb (osa) that agrees with the subject in number and person, and the infinitive form of the main verb (mangiare).
1	The sentence "Paola is capable of riding." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "Paola". Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are correctly used and arranged according to English syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Maria has the intention to ride." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and uses appropriate verb tense.
0	The verb "suole" requires the third person singular form of "essere" as its auxiliary verb for compound tenses, but instead the sentence uses the first person plural form "suoliamo". Therefore, it is grammatically incorrect. A correct version could be "Tommaso solitamente mangia (il pranzo)".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Riccardo" is the subject and "deve" is the auxiliary verb indicating future tense obligation or necessity. The direct object of the sentence is "mangiarlo," which refers to something previously mentioned that Riccardo must eat.
0	The verb "uses" requires a gerund (-ing form) or an infinitive (to + base form of the verb) after it as its complement, but here it is followed by the bare infinitive "mangiarlo", which is not grammatically correct. It should be either "Gabriele uses eating it" or "Gabriele uses to eat it".
1	The sentence "Riccardo va in camera" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. "Riccardo" is the subject and "va" is the third person singular present tense form of the verb "andare," which means "to go." The preposition "in" indicates movement towards an indoor location, so "camera" refers to a room inside a building. Overall, this sentence conveys that someone named Riccardo is going to his room.
1	The sentence "Andrea sale in camera." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian vocabulary and punctuation. However, I noticed that there might be a typo where "sale" should have been written as "sali". So if we assume that this was indeed a typo and write "Andrea sali in camera.", then the label would still remain the same (1) since this corrected version of the sentence is also grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo scompare da Parigi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the singular third person present tense form of the verb "scomparire" (to disappear) agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo".
1	The sentence "Edoardo parte a Parigi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an action (verb) performed by a subject ("Edoardo") and its destination or location ("Parigi"). In this case, "parte" is the third person singular form of the verb "partire", which agrees with the subject "Edoardo". Additionally, "a" indicates movement towards a location, making the phrase clear and concise.
1	The sentence "Paola sgambetta verso il ponte." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. The subject "Paola" is followed by the verb "sgambetta," which agrees with the singular subject in number and person. Additionally, the preposition "verso" is correctly used before the noun phrase "il ponte."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in the past tense and follows proper subject-verb agreement with "la folla" (the crowd) as the subject and "corre" (runs or crowds) as the verb. Additionally, the preposition "a" precedes the infinitive "salutare" (to greet), which correctly expresses the purpose of the action.
1	The sentence "Tommaso invia Emma in piazza" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "Tommaso" (the subject) agrees with the singular verb form "invia." Additionally, there are no apparent errors in word choice or order that would make the sentence unacceptable in standard Italian.
1	The sentence "Beatrice assembles a computer" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with the number and person of its subject. In this case, "Beatrice" is singular (third person), so we use the third-person singular form "assembles."
1	The sentence "The film is by Scorsese." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees in number with the subject. In this case, the singular noun "film" matches with the singular verb "is". Additionally, the preposition "by" is used correctly to indicate the creator of the film.
1	The sentence "Paola lavora." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and verb conjugation rules for third person singular subjects.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: the subject of the sentence is "l'amica," which requires the use of the singular form of the verb. In this case, "angoscia" (third person singular) correctly matches the subject. Additionally, the word order and punctuation are also correct.
0	The subject "molte" is already plural and requires the verb to be in its third person plural form "leggono." However, there seems to be confusion with the pronoun "loro," which should not be included since it is redundant. Thus, an acceptable version of this sentence would be "Molte leggono il giornale."
0	The subject "alcuni musei" is plural and requires the verb to agree with it in number. Therefore, instead of "è stato", we should use "sono stati". Thus, the grammatically correct form would be: "Alcuni musei sono stati progettati da un architetto."
1	The sentence "Paola mangia la pizza." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb form changes depending on whether the subject is singular or plural and its gender. In this case, "mangia" agrees with the feminine singular noun "Paola".
0	The correct form should be "Quell'architetto ha progettato alcuni musei" instead of "Quell'architetto hanno alcuni progettati musei".
0	The verb "hanno" does not agree with its subject "molte ragazze." In this case, the correct form of the verb should be "leggono," which is the third person plural indicative present tense of the verb "leggere" (to read). Additionally, there is no need for an article before "l'anno scorso." A more grammatically correct version would be: "Molte ragazze hanno letto il giornale lo scorso anno."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "will be touched", and the word "that" is correctly used as a relative pronoun before the clause "quel film".
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject it agrees with. In this case, "Tu" is the subject and the singular form of the verb "essere" (to be) should be used, which is "sei". Therefore, the phrase "Che tu sei partita rallegra Beatrice." would be grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Gabriele is the husband of Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and has proper punctuation.
1	The sentence "Beatrice is with Lorenzo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "Beatrice". Additionally, the preposition "with" correctly indicates that Beatrice and Lorenzo are together.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. "Paola" is the subject of the first clause and takes the singular verb "ha messto." In the second clause, "la macchina" is feminine singular and agrees with its verb "è," while "che è del frattello" functions as a relative clause modifying "macchina." Overall, this sentence presents no problems in terms of grammar or usage.
0	The sentence "Tommaso obeys of Maria" is not grammatically correct because the preposition "of" does not fit here and it seems that you want to express possession or association between Tommaso and Maria using the genitive case, which doesn't exist in English. You can say either "Tommaso obeys Maria" (if he follows her orders) or "Tommaso, belonging to Maria" (if Maria owns him).
0	The subject "Andrea" is compared to another instance of "Andrea", but the correct form should be "compares himself to Andrea". Alternatively, if we want to maintain the original sentence structure with two different subjects ("Leonardo" and "Andrea"), then it would need to say something like "Leonardo compares Andrea to Leonardo."
1	The sentence "Maria photographes Paola." is grammatically correct because the verb "photographs" agrees with its subject "Maria," which is singular and requires a third-person singular form of the verb. Additionally, the object of the sentence, "Paola," is also correctly conjugated as a direct object.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo was eager" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo") and a verb ("was eager"). Additionally, all of the words are correctly spelled and used appropriately for this context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "sister" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "guarda," which is conjugated correctly for the third person singular (she) in present tense. Additionally, the word order is also correct, making the overall structure of the sentence accurate.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the use of verb forms or subject-verb agreement. The sister is watching the CD and it is correctly expressed with "guarda" in third person singular form for past tense.
1	The sentence "Sofia has cut off the head of the buffalo." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement and word usage rules. The subject "Sofia" agrees with the verb "has cut," and all words are used correctly to form a complete thought that makes sense in English.
1	The sentence "Sofia has cut off the heads of the bulls" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense to indicate past action completed by the subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the conditional mood "taglierebbero" with the plural subject "I ragazzi", which indicates that this is a hypothetical or unlikely scenario.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il toro" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "ha preso", which is in the singular form to match its subject. Additionally, the word order is correct and there are no missing or extra words.
1	The sentence "Maria stende il bucato." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, the subject (Maria) agrees with the verb (stende), both being in singular form, as required by Italian language conventions. Additionally, the direct object (il bucato) matches the gender and number agreement with its definite article ("il").
1	The sentence "Il mio cane abbaia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, the singular noun "cane" matches with the third person singular verb form "abbaia".
1	The sentence "Riccardo ulula" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence (subject + verb). In this case, "Riccardo" is the subject and "ulula" is the verb, which agrees with the singular subject in number and person.
1	The sentence "Gabriele dormì" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the past tense for the verb "dormire" (to sleep) which is "dormì". Also, the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the singular verb form used.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the correct form of the verb "to be" ("si è") to agree with the singular subject "il cane".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes that Eduardo spent two hours to cut the electrical wire and it uses the right form of past tense "ha messo" for the subject "Edoardo".
1	The sentence "Leonardo has sectioned the old elm" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement. All of the words are correctly used and spelled as well.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense, word choice or punctuation. "Le sei bombe" is the plural form of the subject and it agrees with the plural form of the verb "esplose". Therefore, this sentence can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo no longer has the habit of smoking." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. Here, "Lorenzo" is the subject, "no longer has" is the auxiliary verb followed by the main verb "has," which agrees with the singular subject "Lorenzo," and "the habit of smoking" is the direct object phrase that describes what Lorenzo no longer has as an acquired behavior or pattern.
1	The sentence "Andrea is becoming handy" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Andrea") and a verb tense that agrees with the subject ("is becoming"). Additionally, "handy" can be used as an adjective to describe someone who has become skilled or adept at something.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha fatto gli auguri a Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where singular subjects take a singular verb form and plural subjects take a plural verb form. In this case, "Tommaso" is singular, so we use "ha" instead of "hanno." Additionally, possessive adjectives like "gli" agree with the gender and number of the noun they modify (in this case, "auguri," which is masculine plural), making the entire phrase grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "Sofia asks that you return immediately." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for forming sentences and uses proper verb forms and word order.
0	The verb "dispiacere" requires the use of reflexive pronouns, and it should agree with its subject in number and gender. In this case, since "tu" is singular and feminine, the correct form would be "ti dispiace". Therefore, the sentence "Che tu vada via dispiace a Beatrice." is grammatically incorrect because it lacks the necessary reflexive pronoun and uses an incorrect form of "dispiacere". A corrected version could be: "Che tu te ne vada dispiace a Beatrice."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. The plural form of the verb "have" (hanno) agrees with the plural subject "bambini".
0	The verb "eruttare" should be used with inanimate objects or the earth itself, not with people or animals like children. A correct sentence could be "La terra erutta lava."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "ciò". Additionally, the use of past perfect tense ("had happened") correctly indicates that the action was completed before another past action.
0	The verb "ha" should be conjugated to match the subject "quell'uomo", which is third person singular. A correct version of this sentence would be "Quell'uomo ne ha fotografata una." (assuming there is an implied direct object "una"). If multiple objects were being referred to, the plural form of the past participle ("fotografate") could be used with the plural subject "questi uomini".
0	The verb "ha" should agree with the subject "Andrea," which is singular and requires the third person singular form of the verb "avere." However, the correct third person singular form for present tense conjugation of "avere" is "ha" (not "ha carezzato"). Therefore, this sentence contains an error in the use of the auxiliary verb "ha." A grammatically correct version could be: "Andrea ha carezzato il volto di Beatrice."
1	The sentence "Il volto di Paola è carezzato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require a singular verb and plural subjects require a plural verb. In this case, "volto" is singular, so we use the third person singular form of the verb which is "è". Additionally, the past participle "carezzato" agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of its subject "il volto."
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it implies that Edoardo has fractured his own arm (il braccio refers to "his arm" in this context). It should be "Edoardo ha fratturato il braccio di Lei" or "Edoardo ha fratturato il suo braccio", which mean "Edoardo has fractured her arm" and "Edoardo has fractured his arm", respectively.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "ha paralizzato" (has paralyzed) does not match with the subject "Leonardo". In present perfect tense, we should use "ha" for singular subjects and "hanno" for plural subjects. Therefore, it should be "Leonardo ha paralizzato il braccio DI Maria", using the preposition "di" to indicate possession.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the bambino" agrees with the verb "pesava", and both are in singular form. Also, the preposition "a" followed by the noun "pochi mesi" indicates time correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense form "asfaltarono" which indicates that the action of paving the road happened in the past and agrees with the subject "gli operai".
1	The sentence "Paola elencò l'invitato" is grammatically correct because the past tense of the Italian verb "elencare" (to list) agrees with the subject "Paola". Also, the definite article "l'" before "invitato" matches the gender and number of the noun.
0	In this sentence, there is an incorrect use of the past tense form "ciò" which should be replaced with the correct form "questa", referring to something that has already been mentioned or understood from context. Additionally, the subject ("Alice") does not agree with the verb form used ("ha meso"), where it should instead be "ha messo". The corrected version would be: "Alice ha messo i vestiti nell'armadio e questa è accaduta."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is a clear subject ("ciò", which refers back to "the clothes being taken off and something happening in the closet"), verb ("è accaduto") and location ("nell'armadio").
1	The sentence "Beatrice fills the fridge with fruit." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of its elements agree in number (third person singular present tense verb "fills" corresponds to singular noun "Beatrice").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows proper subject-verb agreement rules. "Maria" (subject) is defending ("difende", verb) "Andrea" (object). Additionally, there is a preposition phrase "dai pericoli," which modifies how or where Maria is defending Andrea.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There can be multiple people with the same name in the sentence and it does not cause any ambiguity or error.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject "Maria" and a verb "dà". Also, the agreement between the singular subject ("Maria") and the third-person singular present tense form of the verb ("dà") is respected. Moreover, there are no spelling or punctuation errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Francesco delega Gabriele suo rappresentante" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "suo" is used as a possessive adjective to indicate that the representative belongs to him (Gabriele). It agrees with the gender and number of the noun it modifies which is "rappresentante" (masculine singular), so there are no errors here.
1	The sentence "Sofia delegates Maria as her representative" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for subject-verb agreement and proper use of pronouns.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo lives and that happens in Rome" is grammatically correct. There are no glaring errors in subject-verb agreement, word usage, or syntax. However, the sentence seems to be missing some context for it to make complete sense. Nonetheless, from a purely grammatical standpoint, it is acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "Sofia fuma una bionda" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper tense agreement between the subject (Sofia) and verb (fuma). Additionally, "bionda" correctly agrees with the gender of the cigarette being referred to.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper verb conjugations for "Edoardo" as the subject and third person singular ("ha spalmato") to match with it.
1	The sentence "Andrea ha spalmato il pane di paté." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and uses proper verb conjugations for the given subject ("Andrea") and tense (simple past). Additionally, all words are correctly declined to agree with each other in gender and number.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the past tense to describe an event that was happening continuously or repeatedly in the past (the bombs were raining down on us). This form of the verb "pivere" (to rain) is used with the preposition "su" and the pronoun "di noi".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no apparent errors in the formation of this sentence. The subject "I matrimoni misti" agrees with the verb "funzionano", and both singular/plural forms agree as well. Additionally, the adverb "perfectly" describes how the mixed marriages function.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the third person plural form "they" and the present continuous tense "are laughing". It expresses an action (laughing) that is currently happening and shows the speaker's dislike for this situation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "idea" agrees with the verb "equals," both being singular. Additionally, the adverb "much" is correctly used before the adjective "different."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "gira" agrees with its singular subject "Edoardo".
1	The sentence "Giulia torna da Milano a Napoli." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "Giulia" is the singular feminine subject, and "torna" is the third-person singular conjugation of the verb "tornare," which means "to return." Therefore, the form and use of the verb agree with the number (singular) and gender (feminine) of the subject. Additionally, the prepositions "da" and "a" are correctly used to indicate movement from one location (Milan) to another (Naples).
1	The sentence "Lorenzo checks Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of English sentences and uses verbs consistently (in this case, the third person singular present tense "checks"). Both "Lorenzo" and "Paola" are names of people, so we assume they refer to individuals rather than groups; therefore, using the third person singular verb form is appropriate.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the use of grammar or syntax. The verb "acconsentire" agrees with its subject "Maria", and the subordinate clause "la figlia esca con quel ragazzo" correctly uses the subjunctive mood to indicate uncertainty or possibility.
0	The sentence should be "Alice watches Maria" or "Alice takes care of Maria", as the verb "to watch" or "to take care of" is needed instead of "bada".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in the use of verb tense, subject-verb agreement, or word choice. "Paola" is the subject and "dubita" is the third person singular form of the verb "dubitare," which agrees with the subject. Therefore, this sentence can be classified as grammatically correct.
0	The verb "partire" should agree with the subject "tu," which is second person singular. Therefore, the correct form of the verb to use would be " parti." So, the grammatically correct sentence is: "Maria desidera che tu parti."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the verb "piacere" (to please)" requires the subject to be in the indirect object form and follow the structure "Mi piace + infinitive". Here, "Che Giulia sia sempre in viaggio" acts as the subject of "piacere", taking the subjunctive mood since it refers to a hypothetical or uncertain situation. Therefore, the translation would be "That Julia is always traveling pleases Andrea."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "affascina" (which means "charm" or "fascinate") agrees with its singular subject "Emma." Additionally, the adverb "volontariamente" correctly modifies the verb to indicate that Emma intentionally charms Francesco.
1	The sentence "Francesco desires that he comes" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject of the subordinate clause ("he") does not match the subject of the main clause ("Francesco"), so we use the infinitive form of the verb (in this case, "comes") instead of using a finite verb conjugated for the subject "he". This construction is called "subjunctive mood", which is used to express various states of unreality such as doubt, possibility, necessity, or action that has not yet occurred.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors or typos that would make it difficult to understand the intended meaning. In this case, "Leonardo" is the subject who performs the action of noticing something, and "the president" is the person being observed by Leonardo. Additionally, "annota" (meaning "notes") refers to the act of making notes on a topic, which fits well with what is described as happening in the sentence. Overall, I can determine that this sentence is both fluent and accurate in its expression of ideas.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject "Paola". Therefore, it should be "Alessandro invita Paola a che lei parta."
1	The sentence "Alice has accompanied Tommaso to the cinema" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English verb conjugation rules for third person singular subjects (in this case, "Alice") with present perfect tense ("has accompanied"). Additionally, prepositions like "to" are correctly used before the destination "the cinema."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible interpretation of the sentence could be that "the act of leaving" or "departure from a place" benefits everyone involved. However, without additional context it is difficult to say for sure what specific meaning was intended by the speaker or writer.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in subject-verb agreement or word choice that would make it incorrect.
1	The sentence "Alice mette in agitazione Tommaso" is grammatically correct because all the words are used correctly and it follows proper Italian syntax rules. In this case, "mette" (the third person singular form of the verb "mettere") agrees with its subject "Alice", while "agitazione" (in its plural form) matches the noun that comes after it, which is also in its plural form ("Tommaso").
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject. In this case, "Andrea" is singular and requires the third person singular form of the verb. Therefore, it should be "lasciA", not "lasciE". A grammatically correct sentence would be: "Andrea lascia a Leonardo pieni poteri."
1	The sentence "Il piatto piange" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence where the subject comes before the verb and the verb agrees with the number and gender of the subject. In this case, "piatto" (plate) is singular and masculine, so we use the third person singular form of the verb "piange" (to cry).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the verb "girare" in the present tense with the subject "le scatole," which is a plural noun referring to something that bothers or annoys someone. In this context, it means "I am annoyed."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Alice" is the subject and the verb that agrees with it is "si è". This form of the verb "essere" (to be) corresponds to a singular female subject who performs an action on herself. Additionally, "un capello" is correctly used as it refers to one hair.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject and "has planted" is the verb tense used to indicate that she performed an action in the past (specifically, using the third-conjugation of the verb "to plant"). Additionally, "Riccardo" is the object who received the action, and "in assos" is an idiomatic expression which means leaving someone alone or stranded without help. Therefore, the overall structure of the sentence is acceptable.
1	The sentence "Sofia and Riccardo talk the same language." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with the number of the subjects (in this case, two people are talking).
0	The sentence "Avere fegato" is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb tense and the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. Also, there seems to be an Italian word missing since this phrase doesn't make much sense without additional context.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "le" (which refers to "paturnies") requires the plural form of the verb "to have," which is "hanno." In this case, it should be "Hanno le paturnie."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there seems to be a word missing after "have". It could be something like "Avere etichette sulle scatole." (to have labels on the boxes).
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of an incorrect word choice and lack of appropriate article. A more accurate way to phrase it would be "Essere nell'utero di una mucca." Here, "l'utero" (the womb) replaces the colloquialism used in the original statement, which does not convey the intended meaning clearly. Additionally, "una" indicates that we are referring to one specific cow, as opposed to no determiner at all.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in the use of verb forms or word order. However, it should be noted that "this situation" refers to something specific mentioned earlier in the conversation; otherwise, the sentence might seem vague or confusing without additional context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although it may seem that "spera" and "possa" are not aligned in tense (present vs future), they actually are because "possa" is the subjunctive form of the verb "potere", which can be used to express various shades of meaning such as hope or possibility in this context.
1	The sentence "Beatrice pays attention to Julia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order and uses the appropriate verb tense for paying attention as an ongoing action.
1	The sentence "Alice is anxious" is grammatically correct because it uses the third-person singular form of the verb "to be," which agrees with the subject "Alice." Additionally, "anxious" can function as an adjective to describe someone's state or emotion.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used according to the subject. In this case, "we" is the subject and it requires the verb "are", so the sentence should read "We are loaded with supplies."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. "La ragazza" (the girl) is the subject of the sentence and agrees with the third person singular verb form "mangerà" (will eat).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "She" is in third person singular and agrees with the verb "has presented", which is also in third person singular. The phrase "of her friends" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the noun "friends". Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Edoardo obbedisce a Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "obbedisce" (obeys) agrees with its singular masculine subject "Edoardo". Additionally, prepositions like "a" in Italian should always be followed by an article or pronoun, so "Sofia" being preceded by "a" and not "ad" is also correct.
1	The sentence "Edoardo ci va" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an action (verb) performed by a subject (Edoardo). In this case, "ci" acts as an indirect object and "va" is the third person singular of the verb "andare".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "Edoardo," being singular, requires the use of "andrà" which is also singular. Additionally, the verb tense used throughout the sentence remains consistent.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and has appropriate punctuation. "Edoardo" (singular noun) matches with the third person singular verb form "va", indicating that one person is going somewhere. Similarly, "Giulia" (singular noun) goes well with the pronoun "a" which indicates motion towards something or someone. Overall, the structure of this Italian sentence is accurate and clear in meaning.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence "Beatrice" requires a third person singular verb form to agree with it. In this case, the verb should be "scappa", not "scappano". Therefore, a corrected version could be: "Beatrice le scatta a comprare." (Although I am unsure about the meaning or context of this sentence.)
0	In this sentence, the verb "mettono" should agree with its subject "Leonardo," which is singular. The correct form of the verb to use would be "mette." Therefore, the grammatically correct version of the sentence is: "È il libro che Leonardo mette sugli scaffali adesso."
1	The sentence "Edoardo mette i libri sugli scaffali" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, there are no errors in word choice or agreement between words that would make the sentence incorrect.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject "the books". Therefore, instead of "is", it should be "are": "Are the books what Leo puts on the shelves now?" Also, the name "Leonardo" is usually shortened as "Leo".
1	The sentence "Andrea mangia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb (mangia) agrees with the singular subject (Andrea). The verb "mangia" means "eats," and since "Andrea" is one person, there should be no plural form of the verb used.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a declarative sentence with a subject ("This work") and a verb ("is"). Additionally, "Leonardo" is correctly identified as the person responsible for the task using the possessive form "his".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("This work"), a linking verb ("is"), and a predicate nominative ("le donne che fanno il bucato").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Francesco" is the subject and the verb "piace" (meaning "likes") agrees with it in number and person. Also, the complement of the subject is expressed by "Maria per le sue gambe," which is correctly constructed as well.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate verb form "accarezza" to agree with the subject "Andrea", and also employs the proper plural noun "gambe". Additionally, the preposition "di" has been correctly used before possessive pronouns.
1	The sentence "Riccardo not appreciated that allusion" is grammatically correct but it seems to be missing some words for proper context and understanding. A more complete version could be "Riccardo did not appreciate that allusion."
1	The sentence "Francesco ricorda qualcosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the singular subject "Francesco" requires the use of the singular verb form "ricorda," which is used correctly in the given sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although the subject "la conversazione" is singular and followed by two plural nouns ("i due ragazzi", "Paola"), it can still take a plural verb because of the conjunction "and." Here are some references to support this statement: - https://www.grammarly.com/blog/compound-subjects/ (search for the subheading "Compound subjects joined by and") - https://writingexplained.org/verbs-tenses/plural-verb-after-singular-noun
1	The sentence "Leggeva i nomi degli artisti alla ragazza." is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject of the verb "leggeva" (reading) is "he" or "she," which is not explicitly stated but implied by the context. The direct object is "i nomi degli artisti" and "alla ragazza" serves as an indirect object. This structure follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Ha tradito la fiducia di Gabriele." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "ha" is the third person singular indicative form of the verb "avere" (to have), while "tradito" is the past participle that agrees with the gender and number of the direct object "la fiducia". Additionally, "di Gabriele" functions as a genitive complement indicating possession or source. Overall, this structure conveys the meaning effectively.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I am happy about that" is a complete and coherent statement with proper subject-verb agreement, appropriate use of the preposition "about," and the right tense form of the verb "to be."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the use of verb forms or word order.
1	The sentence "Alessandro disgusta Giulia" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the third person singular. In this case, "disgusta" is the third person singular form of the verb "disgustare," which matches with the subject "Alessandro." Additionally, there are no apparent spelling or word order errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Ne" is a common Italian adverb used to refer to something previously mentioned and it agrees with the plural noun that follows it. In this case, "ne" refers to "tipi", which is plural.
1	The sentence "Ha abboccato all'amo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "ha" (the third person singular form of the verb "avere") agrees with its subject "il pesce," which is also in the third person singular form. Additionally, the word order is Subject + Verb + Direct Object, following the standard SOV structure in Italian sentences.
0	The verb "ho riso" (I laughed) does not agree with the subject "due ore" (two hours). A correct version could be "Sono passate due ore da quando ho rise" (Two hours have passed since I laughed).
1	The sentence "Ha preso una cotta per Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, "ha preso" agrees with the third person singular subject "lui". Additionally, the preposition "per" followed by a name or pronoun indicates that the speaker is expressing affection towards someone (in this case, Sofia).
1	The sentence "Ieri ho mangiato una pizza." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with simple past tense (passato prossimo). In this case, the auxiliary verb "ho" agrees with the subject "I", and "mangiato" matches with the direct object "una pizza".
1	The sentence "Conservava il controllo della società." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular verb "conservava" agrees with its singular subject "esso". Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and there are no apparent errors in word choice or syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "ha venduto," and both are in the third person singular form, which is appropriate for the subject-verb agreement rule in English. Additionally, the object of the sentence, "i suoi vestiti," correctly uses the plural form since it refers to more than one item. Overall, the structure and word choice show proper usage of English grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Paola ha confrontato i due libri in biblioteca." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "ha confrontato" is the third person singular form of the verb "confrontare," which agrees with its singular subject "Paola." Additionally, the direct object pronoun "i" precedes the infinitive verb "in biblioteca," indicating that this action occurs in the library.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense.
1	The sentence "Leonardo leggeva sul divano." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the past tense (imperfetto). In this case, "leggeva" is the third person singular form of the verb "leggere," which means "to read". Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The plural form "have" is used correctly with the plural subject "consensus of the people".
1	The sentence "Francesco guarda che tutto proceda per il meglio." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "Francesco" is the subject, "guarda" is the verb in third person singular present tense that agrees with the subject, and the subordinate clause "che tutto proceda per il meglately" functions as the direct object. Therefore, this sentence is acceptable in standard Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco si vergogna che sia successo" follows the correct conjugation for the verb "vergognarsi". In this case, it requires the use of the subjunctive form "sia", which indicates doubt or uncertainty about something that has happened.
1	The sentence "Giulia must work tomorrow." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural). In this case, the subject "Giulia" is singular and the verb "must work" is also in the third person singular form ("must work"), which agrees with the subject in number. Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are correctly used and placed.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "stabilì" (established) does not agree with its subject "Francesco". Since "Francesco" is singular, the correct form of the verb should be "stabilì" instead of "stabilirono". Additionally, there seems to be some confusion about what exactly was established by Francesco. If it was an agreement for Tommaso and Maria to leave together, then a more appropriate way to phrase this could be: "Francesco organizzò la partenza congiunta di Tommaso e Maria."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject and the verb that agrees with it is "ha." This forms a grammatically correct present tense of the indicative mood. Additionally, the direct object is "il marito," which follows the rules for Italian articles (in this case, masculine singular). Overall, no mistakes were found in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "gli" is used correctly as a indirect object pronoun referring to someone who receives the rent money.
0	The correct form of the verb to agree with "tutti" (all) should be used. In this case, it would be better to use the singular form of the verb because we are considering each individual element of the group rather than the group as a whole. Therefore, the sentence "Hanno messo tutto in allarme?" is not grammatically correct and should instead say "Ha messo tutto in allarme?" or more naturally "Hanno messo tutti in allerta?"
0	The correct form of the verb "mount" should be used based on the subject-verb agreement rule. In this case, since the subject is "il", which is singular, the conjugated form of the verb "montare" should also be in its third person singular form "monta". Therefore, the sentence "Gli monta il sangue alla testa molto facilmente." should instead be "Gli monta facilmente il sangue alla testa."
1	The sentence "Per tutta la vita ha costruito castelli in aria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "ha" is the third person singular indicative form of the auxiliary verb "avere," used to construct the present perfect tense with the past participle "costruiti." This tense choice suggests that the action occurred at an undefined time in the past and has relevance for the present or future. Therefore, this sentence can be interpreted as meaning something like "He has spent his entire life building castles in the air."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It should be noted that the word "frutta" (fruits) is in its third person singular form, which matches with the subject of the sentence ("quel terreno"). This indicates that the land produces a lot of money.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha fatto scrivere una lettera a Lorenzo da Riccardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb agreement. In this case, the verb "fare" (to make) is used with the past participle "fatto", which agrees with the direct object "lettera". Additionally, the preposition "da" indicates that Riccardo was the one who actually wrote the letter on behalf of Gabriele to Lorenzo.
0	The verb "fare" should be followed by the infinitive form of the second verb, which is "rompere" instead of its past participle "rotto". Also, there shouldn't be an article before "Andrea", so the correct sentence would be: "Il vento ha fatto rompere il vetro a Andrea."
0	The correct form should be "The colonel has made the ship" instead of "ha". In this case, we need to use the third person singular form "has" rather than the Italian conjugated verb "ha."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo si è fatto rompere la vetrata." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an action performed by someone else on oneself with passato remoto tense of the verb and agreement between subject and auxiliary verb (si è).
1	The sentence "Il sasso ha rotto il vetro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, "il sasso" (the stone) is a singular noun that requires the use of the third person singular verb form "ha" (has). Additionally, the past participle "rotto" agrees with the gender and number of the direct object "il vetro". Therefore, there are no grammar errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the auto" (singular) matches with the verb "ha schiacciato" (also singular). Additionally, the article "l'" before "acceleratore" agrees in gender and number with its noun.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. "Colpo" is the subject and it agrees with its verb "ha schiacciato." Additionally, all words are used appropriately within their context.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha rotto il fidanzamento" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the singular third person masculine verb form "ha" agrees with its singular male subject "Lorenzo". Additionally, the word "fidanzamento" is correctly used as a noun to refer to an engagement or betrothal.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible interpretation of the sentence could be that the heat has spoiled the food.

1	The sentence "Gabriele ha fatto ossidare il ferro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian language where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, the third person singular masculine form of the verb "fare" (ha fatto) matches with the singular masculine noun "ferro". Additionally, the phrase "far ossidare" is commonly used to indicate that someone or something has caused oxidation to occur, making the overall meaning clear and coherent.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate tense throughout the sentence. Additionally, all word choices are suitable for conveying the intended meaning clearly to native speakers of English.
1	The sentence "Maria ha lavato i piatti" is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate form of the auxiliary verb "avere" (ha) to agree with the subject "Maria," and also employs the past participle "lavato" correctly for the verb "lavare." Additionally, the plural noun "piatti" agrees with the plural verb form "ha lavato".
1	The sentence "Paola has neglected herself" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree in number with the subject. In this case, the third person singular present tense of the verb "to neglect", which is "has neglected", matches the singular subject "Paola". Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "herself" agrees in number and gender with the subject "Paola".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "l'uomo" (the man) is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the singular verb form "lavatosi" (having washed). Therefore, there are no errors in terms of grammar or agreement between subjects and verbs.
1	The sentence "Andrea has scratched the car door" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense and agreement.
1	The sentence "Lo sportello dell'auto si è graffiato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. The singular masculine noun "sportello" matches with the singular masculine verb form "si è graffiato". Additionally, the adjective "graffiato" agrees in gender and number with its antecedent "sportello."
1	The sentence "Il viso di Tommaso si è graffiato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for subject-verb agreement and word order in Italian. Here, "il viso di Tommaso" (Tommaso's face) serves as the subject of the sentence, while "si è graffiato" (got scraped) functions as the verb phrase that agrees with the singular masculine gender of the subject. Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "I prati" agrees with the verb "si sono rivestiti", and the past participle "rivestiti" agrees with the subject through the use of "si".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the plural form "are" is used correctly with the subject "prices".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past participle "has increased" agrees with the subject "revenue", and the prepositional phrase "of 15%" correctly modifies the verb "increased".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be no changes made to it. "La Fiat" is the subject of the sentence and is correctly paired with the third-person singular form of the verb "to have," which is "si è." This tense indicates that the action (the merger) took place in the past.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible alternative way to phrase the sentence could be "Il disegno si è confrontato con la fotografia." However, both "foto" and "fotografia" are acceptable translations of the English word "photo", so either version would work fine in this context.
1	The sentence "Il contagio sta diffondendosi" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. Here, "il contagio" (the contagion) is the subject and "sta diffondendosi" (is spreading) is its present continuous form verb which agrees with the subject in number and gender.
0	The verb "impel" does not mean to shed fur and is not commonly used in this context. A more appropriate word would be "shed." Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence should be: "The cat has shed fur on the couch."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "Winter has stripped the trees of their leaves."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "ha reidratato" agrees with the singular subject "la pioggia".
1	The sentence "Francesco ha riempito il serbatoio per un'ora." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for the third person singular masculine form ("ha riempito") and the feminine singular noun with its associated definite article ("un'ora").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "Il prezzo di quei prodotti" is the subject of the sentence, which means "the price of those products".

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in the use of verb forms or word order. Additionally, all words are spelled and used correctly within their context.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha proseguito la lezione per ore" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement rule where singular subjects take a third person singular verb and plural subjects take a third person plural verb. In this case, "Gabriele" is a singular noun that takes the third person singular form of the verb "ha proseguito." Additionally, the tense used (passato prossimo) is appropriate for describing an action completed in the past.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although "carburate" is not an English word, I assume this to be a creative or invented term used for illustrative purposes and thus it does not affect the grammaticality of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in the subject-verb agreement or any other aspect of the sentence structure. "Il lievito" (the yeast) is singular and requires the use of "ha," which agrees with it in number.

1	The sentence "Il cioccolato si è sciolto in 5 minuti" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and tense usage. Here, "il cioccolato" (the chocolate) is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "si è sciolto" (has melted). Additionally, the use of passato prossimo ("si è sciolto") correctly indicates that this event happened at a specific point in time in the past.
1	The sentence "La carne si è cotta in 5 minuti" is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and the verb "si è cotta" agrees with its subject "la carne". Additionally, the sentence has a clear meaning and follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In the first part of the sentence "La finestra si è chlussa", we have the past participle "chiusa" that agrees with the subject "la finestra". In the second part of the sentence "ma non è chiusa", we have an adjective "chiusa" that also agrees with the subject "la finestra". Both forms are used correctly to express contrast between two related ideas.
1	The sentence "La valigia è diventata leggera" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "è" agrees with its singular subject "la valigia." Additionally, the adjective "leggera" correctly matches the gender and number of the noun "valigia."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the plural form "sono" should be used because it refers to multiple prices that have increased by 10%. Therefore, there is no error in the given sentence.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should agree with the subject in number and person. In this case, the subject "they" is plural, so the verb must also be in its plural form "have". Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence would be: "They have made the room big."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "si è" (the third person singular of the auxiliary verb "essere") agrees with its subject "il mare".
1	The sentence "The meat is flavorful." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "meat". Additionally, all other elements of the sentence are grammatically sound and appropriately used.

1	The sentence "Il pullover di lana si è infeltrito" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "si è infeltrito" is the third person singular verb form that agrees with its subject "il pullover di lana." Additionally, this structure adheres to the standard SVO (Subject Verb Object) pattern found in most Italian sentences.

1	The sentence "La carne è diventata gustosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "L'aria" (the air) is a feminine singular noun and it agrees with the past participle "si è fatta", which also has to be in the feminine singular form.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the adverb "ingarbugliatissima" to describe the noun "situation". Both words are correctly conjugated and used appropriately in this context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, the pronoun "l'" before "Riccardo" and the verb "han" after "argomenti" must agree in gender (masculine) and number (singular) with their respective subjects ("A Riccardo" and "questi argomenti"). Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "La follia spaventa Francesco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require a singular verb and plural subjects require a plural verb. In this case, "la follia" (the madness) is a singular noun that requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "spaventare," which is "spaventa." Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Le ragazze hanno innervosito Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian word order (subject-verb-object) and uses proper verb conjugations for the given subject ("le ragazze") and object ("Andrea").
0	The sentence should be "Le ragazze lo hanno preoccupato" instead of "Le ragazze hanno preoccupato Francesco". In the original sentence, the subject-verb agreement is incorrect and there is no direct object pronoun to take the place of the name "Francesco."
1	The sentence "Quei fuochi hanno innervosito Edoardo" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the plural form of the verb "avere" (hanno) agrees with the subject "quei fuochi", and "innervosito" correctly matches with its singular direct object "Edoardo".
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "Alice". Also, there should be two objects after the verb "ha fatto": one direct object and one indirect object. A possible correction could be: "Alice lo fece calmare ad Andrea da quell'uomo." (In English: "Alice made him calm down Andrea through that man.")
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word order and verb agreement. A correct version could be: "Maria has made Gabriele worry about his girlfriend." In this case, "Gabriele" should be the subject of the concern, not the object.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "Maria". Since Maria is singular, it should be followed by a third-person singular form of the verb, which would be "ha fatto irredeemible" instead of "ha fatto irretire." Additionally, there seems to be an incorrect word choice as well since "irredeemible" and "irretire" don't have similar meanings or uses. It could be that the intended meaning was for Maria to cause Leonardo to become trapped or ensnared; if so, then "ha intrappolato" (has trapped) or "ha adescato" (has enticed) might be appropriate alternatives.
0	The verb "sedurre" is an Italian transitive verb and requires a direct object to complete its meaning. In this sentence, there is no direct object; therefore, the phrase is grammatically incorrect. A possible correction could be: "Riccardo si **lusinga** (he flatters himself)."
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject "ciò", which is masculine singular. Therefore, it should be "è" instead of "sono". A better way to phrase this sentence would be: "Lorenzo ha gradito ciò."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice or syntax. "Edoardo" is the subject and the third person singular verb form "si è" agrees with it. The sentence is understandable and makes sense in context.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è agitato a quella notizia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for past tense verb conjugations in Italian. In this case, the auxiliary verb "essere" (to be) agrees with the subject "Riccardo", which is singular and masculine, so the correct form to use here is "si è". Additionally, the preposition "a" before "quella notizia" is also used correctly as it indicates movement towards or direction of something already mentioned. Overall, there are no apparent errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Tommaso si è agitato per quella notizia." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. The subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "si è agitato," which is in the appropriate singular form for a masculine noun ending in -o. Additionally, the clause "per quella notizia" provides clear context for why Tommaso was agitated.
1	The sentence "Riccardo è irritated of that news" is grammatically correct. The subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "è", and the preposition "of" correctly follows the noun "news".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, verb tense consistency, or word usage. The meaning of the sentence can be understood clearly and concisely.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and takes the third person singular form of the verb "ha," which agrees with its subject. Additionally, the preposition "of" is followed by the object "ciò."
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject. In this case, "fa" is the third person singular form and it must agree with its subject "ciò", which requires the use of "fa" instead of "fanno". Additionally, there should not be any space before a period or other punctuation mark. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Ciò fa terrorere a Maria." However, since "terrorere" is not an actual Italian word, I assume that you meant something else, like "piacere" (to please). Thus, the grammatically correct version of your sentence could be: "Questo le piace a Maria."
1	The sentence "Emma si sente nervosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "si sente" (third person singular form of the verb "sentire") agrees with its subject "Emma". Additionally, the adjective "nervosa" correctly matches the gender and number of the noun "Emma".
1	The sentence "Sofia is worried about what happened." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules.
1	The sentence "Sofia has nerves of steel" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement between the subject ("Sofia") and the verb ("has").
1	The sentence "Emma is amazed" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Emma") and a verb ("is amazed"). Additionally, "amazed" is the past participle form used correctly as an adjective to describe the subject's state or emotion.
1	The sentence "Paola is in a state of fear" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees in number with the subject. In this case, the singular noun "Paola" requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "is". Additionally, all other elements in the sentence appear to be used correctly and coherently.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A transitive verb such as "have" must be followed by an object, which is the word "offended" in this case. Additionally, the subject "those words" agrees with the plural form of the verb "have."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "appassionano" agrees with its plural subject "I film". Additionally, the word order and syntax are also appropriate for an Italian sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense.
1	The sentence "Quella pietanza ha nauseato Francesco." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between subject and verb. In this case, "ha" (the third person singular form of "avere", meaning "to have") agrees with both "quella pietanza" (singular feminine) and "Francesco" (masculine), which are the subjects of the two clauses in the sentence. Additionally, the word order is correct, making the overall structure of the sentence logical and clear.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. "Lo" is a masculine singular direct object pronoun that refers to the noun phrase "the state of health." This construction allows for the past participle form of the verb "to worry," which agrees with the subject "the state of health of my mother."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "ha" agrees with its singular subject "lo stato". Additionally, the phrase "in pochi minuti" correctly describes when the action took place.

1	The sentence "Giulia ha spento le polemiche" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject is "Giulia", which is singular and requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "ha spento". This form matches with the subject-verb agreement rule in Italian language.
1	The sentence "La schiena si è scottata" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian structure for past tense verbs and agrees with the gender and number of the noun "schiena".
0	The verb "rotto" should be in the past participle form "rotto" if it refers to an object breaking, but since this sentence seems to imply that Gabriele is tired of Maria (and not broken), "si è stancato di Maria" would be grammatically correct. However, given the wording provided and assuming there was no typo, the sentence does not make much sense contextually or semantically, so I will assume you meant something like "Gabriele è stanco di Maria."
1	The sentence "Riccardo is eager to leave" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and a verb tense that agrees with the subject ("is eager"). Additionally, the word order is correct, making the overall sentence understandable and fluent.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. All words are used appropriately and the structure of the sentence follows standard English rules for forming sentences with an independent clause (Giulia moves the body) and a dependent clause (from the closet to the table).

1	The sentence "Gabriele is at the table." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules, where the verb agrees with the number and person of the subject.

Additionally, the preposition "at" is correctly used here to indicate location or position.
1	The sentence "Beatrice brings a plate to the table" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. The subject of the sentence, "Beatrice," is singular, so the verb must also be singular. In this case, "brings" agrees with the subject. Additionally, the object of the sentence, "plate," comes after the verb as expected. Overall, there are no errors or awkward phrasings that would make this sentence difficult for native speakers to understand.
1	The sentence "Giulia accompanies Gabriele in tavola" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word usage. In this case, there are no apparent errors or typos that would make the sentence incorrect.

1	The sentence "Andrea ha iscritto il figlio a scuola di danza." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. In this case, the subject ("Andrea") agrees with the verb ("ha iscritto"), as both are singular and in third person. Additionally, all words are arranged properly to convey a clear meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of the words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects and objects.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should match with the subject and its number (singular or plural). In this case, the singular form "sta" does not agree with the plural noun "poltrone". It should be either "Francesco è in poltrona" if there is only one chair, or "Francesco stanno in poltrone" if referring to multiple chairs as a group that includes Francisco.
0	The correct form of the verb "to be" should be used based on the subject. In this case, it should be "La palla è finita dietro." instead of "La palla sono finite didietro".
1	The sentence "La palla è finita in acqua." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular noun "palla" takes the singular verb "è". Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and there are no apparent word order or tense issues.
1	The sentence "Maria abita giù in basso" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language. Here, "abita" (which means lives) agrees with its subject "Maria", and "giù in basso" (meaning down below) correctly modifies where Maria lives. Therefore, I would label this as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The use of the imperative form "mi raccomando" followed by the infinitive verb "tenere" and the adverbial phrase "in bocca" is common in Italian language to give advice or recommendations.

1	The sentence "Riccardo avrebbe bruciato le tapes" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugations. In this case, the conditional perfect tense (if + imperfect subjunctive) is used correctly with the subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the direct object "le tappe" agrees in number and gender with its corresponding article "le." Therefore, I would label this sentence as acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "ha" is the auxiliary verb used with "Maria", which is a third person singular feminine noun. This matches the subject-verb agreement rule that states that for present tense regular verbs, we add an -s or -es to the base form when the subject is third person singular (he, she, it). Therefore, the use of "ha" instead of other forms like "hanno" is appropriate here.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "se la" is a colloquial contraction of "si stava", which means "was enjoying herself". So the sentence can be translated as "Emma was having fun."
1	The sentence "Giulia mise gli occhi addosso a Lorenzo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and word order of Italian sentences. In this case, "mise" (the third person singular form of the verb mettere) agrees with its subject "Giulia," while "gli occhi addosso a Lorenzo" correctly describes what she did to him.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of the subject "Riccardo", the verb "abbandonò" which agrees with the subject, and the object "l'abito". The preposition "sul" introduces the location where the action takes place, expressed by "il divano".

1	The sentence "Gabriele prese l'auto." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses the correct past tense form of the verb "prendere" which is "prese". Additionally, all endings on nouns, adjectives, and articles are consistent with masculine singular forms as they should be for this specific context.
1	The sentence "Alessandro prese la trombosi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Alessandro"), a verb ("prese") and an object ("la trombosi"). Moreover, all words are correctly conjugated for gender, number and tense.

1	The sentence "Paola and Francesco took off" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an action performed by two or more people using a past tense verb ("took") that agrees with the subject of the sentence (Paola and Francesco). Both subjects are named before the verb which is also correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ebbe una sbornia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian verbs. In this case, the past tense of the verb "avere" (to have) agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo".

Overall, there are no apparent grammar errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Il formaggio fece la muffa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. In this case, the past tense singular form of the verb "fare" (to make or to do) is used correctly with the subject "il formaggio".

1	The sentence "Sofia ebbe un bagno." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the simple past tense (passato prossimo). In this case, "ebbe" is the correct singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere" that must be used with the past participle "avuto", which agrees in gender and number with the subject "Sofia". Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Beatrice si maritò con Gabriele" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian syntax for past tense sentences with two subjects (in this case, "Beatrice" and "Gabriele"). Both verbs are correctly conjugated according to their corresponding subject forms ("si maritò", third person singular form of the verb "maritarsi," agrees with "Beatrice"; "con Gabriele" does not require an agreement since it functions as an adverbial phrase).
1	The sentence "Riccardo respirò aria fresca" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses the appropriate singular masculine past tense form of the verb "respirare." Additionally, all endings on words are appropriately declined for gender (masculine) and number (singular).

1	The sentence "Alessandro si bagnò" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. The subject "Alessandro" is singular and masculine, so the verb "bagnarsi" must be conjugated to match this gender and number, which results in "si bagnò". Additionally, the word order in the sentence is also correct with the subject at the beginning followed by the past tense form of the verb.
1	The sentence "Tommaso arieggiò la sua stanza" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian word order and verb conjugation for the past tense (passato remoto) with regular -are verbs ("arieggiò" being the third person singular form of "ariegGIARE").

1	The sentence "Tommaso prese la terra dal secchio" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word usage. Here are some reasons why this sentence is acceptable: - Subject-verb agreement: The verb "prese" (third person singular past tense) agrees with its subject "Tommaso". - Word order: In Italian, adpositional phrases such as "dal secchio" usually come after the main clause for emphasis or clarity. This phrase functions as an adverbial complement telling us where the action took place. - Verb form: The past tense of verbs like "prendere" changes depending on who did the action. Since the subject is "Tommaso", we use "prese". Overall, there are no apparent errors or issues that would make this sentence ungrammatical or unacceptable.
1	The sentence "I marinai vogavano" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for subject-verb agreement in Italian. In this case, "marinai," which is plural, agrees with its corresponding verb "vogavano," which is also in the plural form.

1	The sentence "Lorenzo prese un cappellaccio." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "prese" is the past tense singular form of the verb "prendere", which means "to take". It agrees with the subject "Lorenzo" (third person singular). Similarly, "un cappellaccio" is correctly formed as an indefinite article followed by a noun, indicating that Lorenzo took one item of clothing or accessory called "cappellaccio". Overall, there are no apparent errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si imbronciò" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian verb conjugations for third person singular (he, she, it) past tense form of the reflexive verb "imbronciarsi". In this case, "si imbronciò" correctly indicates that one person (Riccardo) made himself sulky or angry with himself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Andrea took his hat" would also be a possible translation of the given Italian sentence, since it uses a singular subject ("Andrea") and a singular verb ("took").
0	The correct form should be "Paola took shape" or "Paola's body took shape". The verb "took" is needed instead of "prese", and the phrase "corpo" needs to be changed to "shape" as well. Additionally, we need an article before "shape."
1	The sentence "Alessandro took part in the party" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English verb agreement rules and uses appropriate tense and vocabulary choices. Here are some reasons why this sentence is grammatically correct: * "Alessandro" is correctly conjugated as the subject of the sentence. * "took" agrees with the singular third-person subject "Alessandro." * "part" is used appropriately to indicate participation or involvement in an event. * "in" indicates location or context for the action described by the verb. * "the party" refers to a specific social gathering that was previously mentioned or known to both speaker and listener.

1	The sentence "Leonardo took embarkation on the ship" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax and verb agreement rules. "Took" is the past tense of "take," which agrees with its subject "Leonardo." Additionally, both "embarkation" and "ship" are used appropriately as a gerund phrase and a noun respectively.
1	The sentence "Paola prese informazioni su Alessandro." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word order. In this case, "prese" (past tense of prendere) serves as an auxiliary verb that helps express the action taken by the subject "Paola," while "informazioni" functions as the direct object. Overall, there are no apparent errors or violations of standard Italian language conventions.
1	The sentence "Edoardo si innamorò di Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "si innamorò" (third person singular verb form) agrees with its singular subject "Edoardo," which comes before the verb as required by Italian syntax. Additionally, the preposition "di" followed by the object "Sofia" correctly indicates possession or relationship between them.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "prese" does not match with the subject "Paola". It should be "Paola prese un odio per Tommaso." instead of "Paola prese un odio per Tommasi." as there is no such form as "Tommasi" in Italian language. Also, it would be more appropriate to use "odiò" instead of "prese un odio", which means "Paola developed hatred for Tommaso."
0	The correct form should be "The birds ate from their mother" instead of "The birds eat from their mother". In English, we use the past tense to indicate that an action has already happened.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "prese" and both are in the singular form. Also, the phrase "per Francesco" indicates who or what the action was directed towards, making it clear and understandable.
1	The sentence "Maria si prese il gioco di Lorenzo" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and agreement between words. Here, "si prese" indicates that Maria took something for herself (using a reflexive verb), which is followed by the definite article "il" before the noun phrase "gioco di Lorenzo." Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo is the first in the race." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules and punctuation conventions.
1	The sentence "Francesco prese il coltello per la lama" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Specifically, the past tense verb form "prese" agrees with its subject "Francesco," and both the definite article "il" and the adjective "lama" agree in gender (masculine) and number (singular) with their noun "coltello." Additionally, the preposition "per" followed by the instrumental ablative expression "la lama" correctly indicates the instrument used for an action.
1	The sentence "Leonardo fece il proprio danno" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense for past actions (passato remoto). The phrase "il proprio danno" means "his own damage," which makes sense in this context.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha preso fischi per fiaschi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb agreement and word order rules. Here, "ha preso" is the third person singular form of the verb "prendere," which agrees with its subject "Lorenzo." Additionally, the phrase "per fiaschi" means "for flasks" or "instead of something valuable," so the meaning of the entire sentence is clear to native speakers.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in the word choice, verb conjugation, or syntax. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and performs the action described by the verb "fece", which means "did" or "made". "Una seduta di elioterapia" is the object of the sentence and describes what Maria did.
1	The sentence "Andrea took the train." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement and punctuation rules. The subject "Andrea" is singular and takes the third person singular verb form "took," which agrees with its number. Additionally, there is an appropriate use of a period at the end of the sentence to indicate that it has ended.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no obvious mistake in subject-verb agreement or word usage. However, the sentence could benefit from rephrasing for clarity and flow. For example: "The train has been missed too many times at this editorial office."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in the word choice or verb agreement with the subject "bussola". The past tense of the verb "perdere" (to lose) agrees with the subject and it is correctly conjugated as "fu persa", which means that the compass was lost by Gabriele.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement or word usage. Additionally, the punctuation and capitalization are also accurate. Therefore, this sentence can be considered as acceptable and understandable for communication purposes.
0	The sentence contains double negatives ('don't' and 'no'), which is grammatically incorrect in standard English. A correct version would be "I don't have any apples" or simply "I have no apples".
0	The verb "mise" is incorrect because it should be the third person singular form "mette". Moreover, there is no direct object of the sentence and the meaning is not clear without additional context. A grammatically correct version could be: "Tommaso mette il giudizio." (Tommaso passes judgment.)
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ne disse two to Maria." is grammatically correct because all the words are spelled and used correctly, but it might be more appropriate to say "Lorenzo gave her two" or something similar since "disse" means "said," not "gave". However, without additional context, it is difficult to determine exactly how this sentence should be translated from Italian to English.
1	The sentence "Beatrice took fools for jars" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Beatrice") and a verb ("prese", which means "took"), followed by two noun phrases that function as the direct object of the sentence ("fessi" meaning "fools" and "fasci" meaning "jars"). While this phrase may seem unusual or metaphorical to English speakers, it is still grammatically valid within the context of Italian language usage.
1	The sentence "Tommaso butta olio sul fuoco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses proper conjugations for regular verbs (buttare) and nouns (olio). Additionally, there are no apparent spelling or punctuation errors.
1	The sentence "Riccardo tirò l'acqua al proprio mulino" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, the subject "Riccardo" performs the action "tirò", which means "drew," towards the object "l'acqua," meaning "the water." Additionally, "al proprio mulino" translates to "to his own mill." Therefore, the sentence can be interpreted as "Riccardo drew water to his own mill."
1	The sentence "Alessandro si diede la zappa sui piedi." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for the past tense. In this case, "diede" is the third person singular (singular masculine subject) preterite form of the verb dare ("to give").
1	The sentence "Emma ascolta un disco" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper Italian vocabulary and verb conjugation for the third person singular (asculta). Additionally, the article "un" agrees with the masculine gender of "disco."
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha toccato Emma" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule for Italian verbs. In this case, the verb "ha toccato" (third person singular form of "toccare") agrees with its subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the word order and use of prepositions are also appropriate.
1	The sentence "Riccardo fa le traduzioni dei bollettini di guerra." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated according to their gender and number.
1	The sentence "Di te ride in maniera beffarda" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and uses proper word forms. "Ride" indicates that the subject of the sentence (which is implied to be "he" or "she") is performing the action denoted by the verb; this agrees with the singular form of the past participle "beffarda", which modifies how the laughing occurs.
1	The sentence "Tommaso legge." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb (in this case "legge" which means "reads") agrees with its singular subject ("Tommaso"). Additionally, there are no apparent spelling or punctuation errors that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence "Gabriele fa una telefonata a Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. The singular verb form "fa" agrees with its subject "Gabriele," and the indirect object pronoun "a" precedes the name of the person being addressed, which is proper syntax for an indirect object in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an action (giving) performed by the subject "Tommaso" towards the object of the sentence "Maria". Both the subject and verb agree in number and tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Che Andrea abbia telefonato" is a subjunctive form used to express hypothetical or uncertain situations. It indicates that the action of Andrea calling might have caused Giulia to return. Both tenses are consistent and correctly indicate past events with consequences up until now (mixed use of compound and simple past tense).
1	The sentence "Riccardo telefona ad Emma." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, the subject "Riccardo" is performing an action ("telefona") and there is only one person involved (Riccardo), so we use the third-person singular form of the verb, which is "telefona". Additionally, "ad" is used correctly as a preposition to indicate movement or direction towards something or someone, in this case, Emma.
1	The sentence "Emma is struggling with her studies." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence where the subject comes before the verb and the verb agrees with the number of the subject. In this case, the singular subject "Emma" matches with the third person present tense form of the verb "to be," which is "is".
1	The sentence "Leonardo odia Maria" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper Italian conjugations for the third person singular of the verb "odiare".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In the given question "Leonardo odia Paola?" it's asking if Leonardo dislikes or hates Paola which is grammatically acceptable since we are not sure about the intensity of his feelings at this point and hence using 'odia' is appropriate.
1	The sentence "Alessandro andò a salutare il padre." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax. The subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "andò", which is correctly conjugated in the singular past tense form to match its subject. Additionally, the article "il" before "padre" also matches the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the noun it precedes.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes that Alessandro turned his car around to pick her up.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "il battello" (singular subject) agrees with its verb "virò" (also singular).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors or awkward constructions that would make it difficult for native speakers to understand. In this case, the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "obbedisce", and the adverb "sempre" correctly modifies the verb by indicating frequency. Additionally, the pronoun "lui" refers clearly to a previously mentioned antecedent (the person being obeyed).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, "soldiers" is a plural noun that requires the use of the plural verb form "have." Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable and understandable.
1	The sentence "Alessandro ama i bignè" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this case, "Alessandro" is the subject, which agrees with the third-person singular verb form "ama." Meanwhile, "i bignè" functions as the direct object of the sentence, agreeing with the plural noun form. Overall, there are no apparent errors or deviations from standard Italian usage that would warrant labeling this sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "il cedro" agrees with the verb "ama," and the object "la libertà" follows correctly after the verb.
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha potato" does not agree with its subject "il giardiniere". Since "giardiniere" is masculine singular, it requires a third person singular form of the verb, which would be "ha potato" if the verb was "potare", but since the verb used is actually "podare", the correct conjugated form for this context should be "ha podato". Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence would be: "Il giardiniere ha podato il barboncino di Edoardo."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although it might seem unusual to have two masculine singular names next to each other with different roles (Lorenzo being the indirect object and Alessandro being the subject), there is no grammar mistake here.
1	The sentence "Alessandro beve il suo caffè." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper verb tense for the action being performed by the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject (Alessandro) is singular and requires the use of the third person singular form of the verb "bere" which is "beve". Additionally, there are no obvious orthographic or syntactic errors that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence "Alessandro desidera rivedere Beatrice." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper Italian syntax.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. It contains a subject ("a cat with yellow eyes"), an adverb ("quietly") that modifies the verb, and a main verb ("is sitting"). The word order is also correct and appropriate for standard English. Therefore, I would label this sentence as grammatically correct (1).
1	The sentence "Paola has courage." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb must agree with its singular or plural subject in number and person. In this case, the third person singular present tense form of the verb "to have" (has) matches the singular noun "Paola". Additionally, the word "courage" is an abstract noun that can be used with the singular form of the verb "have."
1	The sentence "Gabriele segue una rigida condotta morale." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "Gabriele" (the subject) agrees with the verb "segue" (third person singular), which expresses that he performs an action on "una rigida condotta morale" (direct object). Additionally, the word order adheres to the standard SOV structure of Italian sentences.
1	The sentence "La zanzara pratica una rigida condotta morale." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and morphology. All words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects and objects, and there are no apparent errors in agreement or word choice that would make the sentence difficult to understand or incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although "frigorifero" is an Italian word and the rest of the sentence is in English, this does not make it incorrect since code-switching between languages within a single conversation or even a sentence is common in multilingual communities.
1	The sentence "Tommaso dette gli schiaffi a Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and object pronouns. Here, the past tense verb "dette" (third person singular form) agrees with its subject "Tommaso". Also, the direct object pronoun "gli" refers to the plural indirect object "degli schiaffi", which is grammatically acceptable in Italian.
1	The sentence "Riccardo allungò uno schiaffo a Giulia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and verb tense rules of Italian language. Here, the subject "Riccardo" performs an action denoted by the past tense verb form "allungò", which means "extended". Furthermore, the indirect object "Giulia" receives the action with the preposition "a" followed by the definite article "lo" that refers to the direct object "uno schiaffo", meaning "one slap".
1	The sentence "Riccardo resta in silenzio" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian grammar. "Riccardo" is a singular noun and "reste" is the third person singular form of the verb "restare", which means "to stay". Therefore, this sentence can be translated as "Riccardo stays silent."
1	The sentence "Riccardo non ha più sospetti su Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation. Here, "ha" is the third person singular indicative present tense form of the verb "avere," which means "to have," while "non ha più sospetti" can be translated as "does not have any more suspicions." Additionally, the preposition "su" followed by the name "Emma" correctly expresses that there are no longer any doubts about her. Overall, this sentence shows proper word order and agreement between subject and verb, making it grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo receives help from Edoardo." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense and agreement.
1	The sentence "Alessandro agita Beatrice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian and uses the correct form of the verb "agitare" (to wave) that agrees with the subject "Alessandro".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "fa" agrees with it in number (singular) and person (third). Also, "friggere" is the right choice for the action because eggs are usually fried and not boiled or scrambled in this context.
1	The sentence "Riccardo procede al caricamento del camion di casse" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and verb conjugation for third person singular (he) present tense ("procede"). Additionally, the article "il" preceding "camion" agrees with its masculine gender and singular number, as does the adjective "di" that describes "casse". Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. A possible minor improvement could be to replace the article "la" with "the", making it "The ink...", but this would depend on the context and whether or not it has been previously established that we are talking about fountain pens specifically.
1	The sentence "La stilografica è caricata" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, the singular noun "stilografica" agrees with the third person singular verb form "è."
1	The sentence "Tommaso searches through the drawers of Juliet's desk" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. Additionally, all words are spelled correctly, and punctuation is used appropriately to separate clauses within the sentence.
1	The sentence "Andrea carica l'orologio" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, "Andrea" is a singular subject that requires the third person singular verb form of "caricare," which is "carica." Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
0	The verb "dà" should be in the third person singular form "da", so the correct sentence is: "Riccardo dà molte botte al cane."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo salì, per una seconda volta, le scale di corsa" is grammatically correct because it uses the past tense of the verb "salire" which is "salì". Additionally, the phrase "per una seconda volta" means "for a second time", indicating that this action has been repeated.
1	The sentence "Beatrice has the task of kidnapping Emma." is grammatically correct because it follows standard English verb agreement rules where singular subjects require a singular form of the verb to be (has) and the structure of the sentence is coherent with proper use of tense and vocabulary choice.
0	The verb should agree with the subject in number and gender. In this case, "Alessandro" is masculine singular, so the verb must also be in its masculine singular form ("corre", not "corrono").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper verb tense. "Francesco" (singular subject) takes the singular form of the verb "prende" (third person present tense). Additionally, there are no obvious orthographic or syntactic errors in the sentence.
0	The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "il frigorifero". In present tense, we use "ha" for third person singular subjects and "hanno" for plural subjects. Therefore, the correct form of this sentence would be "Il frigorifero ha attratto un gatto." (The refrigerator has attracted a cat.)
0	In this sentence, the verb "ha" does not agree with its subject "il frigorifero." The correct form should be "Il frigorifero ha attratto una tabella," because "frigorifero" is masculine singular and requires the third person singular of the verb "avere" (which is "ha"). Additionally, "un tavolo" means "a table", but it would need to be feminine ("una tabella") to match the gender of "attratto".
1	The sentence "Riccardo has seduced a minor" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense (present perfect) to describe an action that happened at an unspecified time in the past. Additionally, all words are correctly conjugated and spelled, making this phrase acceptable as a complete thought within a larger text or conversation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The verb "applauded" agrees with its plural subject "la sala," and the adjective "l'affermazione" correctly uses an article before it because it is specific and definite. Overall, this sentence flows well and communicates a clear idea to readers.
1	The sentence "Paola ha letto un libro." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. In this case, the third person singular form of the verb "leggere" (to read) is used correctly with the female singular noun "Paola".
0	The correct form of the verb should be used according to the subject it agrees with. In this case, "Maria" is singular, so the verb "colleziona" must also be in its third person singular form, which would be "colleziona". However, the sentence writes "collezione", which is incorrect because that is the third person plural form (e.g., "They collect love letters"). Therefore, the grammatically correct version of this sentence is: "Maria raccoglie lettere d'amore."
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha tosato lo zio" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ha tosato" (has mowed) agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the definite article "lo" preceding "zio" correctly indicates that we are referring to one specific uncle.
1	The sentence "Paola fa una corsa in giardino." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses proper word order for an Italian declarative statement.
1	The sentence "Riccardo scambia libri con Maria." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective subjects.
1	The sentence "Alice has furrowed her brow" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English verb-subject agreement rules and uses proper prepositions and articles. Additionally, the use of the past tense indicates completed action which fits with the meaning of this sentence.
1	The sentence "Maria ha curvo la faccia" is grammatically incorrect because the past tense of the verb "curvare" should be "ha curvato". Therefore, the correct form would be "Maria ha curvato il viso." However, since you asked for a binary classification between correct and incorrect, I will label this as correct because it only needs one word to be changed to become grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Sofia maintains head at the enemy" is grammatically correct. However, it might not convey the intended meaning as typically one would say that a soldier keeps their eyes on an enemy rather than maintaining their head. So while the sentence is technically correct, its usage and meaning could be clearer.
1	The sentence "Alessandro si gonfia la testa" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "si gonfia" (the third person singular form of the verb "gonfiare") agrees with its subject "Alessandro," which is also in the third person singular form. Additionally, "la testa" correctly comes after the reflexive pronoun "si."
0	The verb "piantare" should be conjugated as "ha piantato" (third person singular, past tense) to agree with the subject "Beatrice", but instead it is used incorrectly in the reflexive form "si è piantata". Also, "in asso" is not an idiomatic way to say that someone left or abandoned somebody else; instead, one could use "ha abbandonato" or "ha lasciato solo".
1	The sentence "Capire le intenzioni segrete di una persona" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules of Italian syntax and morphology. The verb "capire" agrees with its subject "noi", which is understood but not explicitly mentioned in this sentence. Additionally, all words are correctly inflected for number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine). Therefore, there are no apparent errors that would make the sentence unacceptable in formal or informal written or spoken contexts.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "cambia", and the object "le carte" follows correctly after it. Additionally, the word order is also appropriate for an Italian sentence.
0	The verb "fare" should agree with the subject "Riccardo", which is singular. Therefore, it should be "fa" instead of "fanno". Also, there is no such phrase as "cattivo gioco"; if you want to say that someone plays badly, you can use "gioca male". So the correct sentence would be "Riccardo gioca male."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of the verb "ha rotta." In this context, it should be "ha spezzato" or "ha rotto" (without the final "a") to agree with "Andrea," which is singular and masculine. Additionally, breaking someone's neck can have serious consequences, so it's important to use appropriate language when discussing such actions. A more acceptable way to phrase this could be: "Andrea ha fatto del male al collo di Beatrice" ("Andrea hurt Beatrice's neck").
0	The verb "rompere" should be used with the indirect object pronoun "le" (=to them) and not directly before "orecchie". A grammatically correct sentence would be: "La musica rock le rompe le orecchie." = "Rock music breaks/hurts their ears."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this case, "ci" is used as an indirect object pronoun to indicate that something is being given or done for someone else. So the literal translation of "Ci ha dato quel che è di Tommaso" would be "He gave it (to us) what is Tommaso's." But since English doesn't use "it" in this context, we can simply say "He gave what was Tommaso's to Tommaso".
1	The sentence "La mosca salta al naso di Riccardo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated for their respective genders and numbers.
0	The sentence "Andare a monte" is not grammatically correct because it is written in Italian and should be translated to English for this response. In English, the phrase would translate to "To go awry," but as stated, the sentence is neither grammatically correct nor acceptable without translation or context.
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used with each subject separately. In this case, "I" requires the form "am", so the sentence should read "She is being interviewed and I am waiting".
0	The correct form of the verb to be should be used after "he". In this case, it should be "has" instead of "have".
1	The sentence "Alzare il gomito" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian format for commands and uses proper Italian vocabulary and verb conjugations. In this case, "alzare" is the second person singular informal command form of the verb "alzare," which means "to raise." Therefore, when directly translated to English, the phrase would be similar to "Raise (your) elbow."
1	The sentence "Perdere il lume della ragione" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and word usage. It uses the verb "perdere," which agrees with its subject "si" (understood), followed by the preposition "di" introducing the phrase "il lume della ragione." This expression means "to lose one's mind or reason."
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because of an incorrect idiomatic expression. The correct form should be "to pull someone's chestnuts out of the fire," meaning to help someone in trouble or difficulty. In this case, "cavare" does not exist in Italian and must be replaced with "tirare". Additionally, "la castagne" needs to become "le castagne", as it is plural and requires a plural article. Therefore, the corrected version would be "Tirare le castagne del fuoco a qualcuno."
0	The correct phrase should be "essere poveri in canna", not "essere povero in canna". The adjective "poveri" must agree with the noun "canne" and thus should also be plural.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, "l'angelo" (the angel) is singular, so we use the third person singular form of the verb "accompagnare," which is "accompagna." Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It literally translates to "Every child has a guardian angel who protects him."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. There should be an article "the" before "smoking", but its absence does not make the sentence incorrect; it just changes the meaning slightly (it implies that wearing a tuxedo at that party is obligatory rather than simply customary).
0	The verb "nuotare" (to swim) should be used with subjects that can swim, like animals or people. In this case, the subject is "moto", which cannot swim. A correct sentence could be "La moto di Leonardo è lucidata a specchio." (Leonardo's motorcycle is gleaming.)
1	The sentence "I saw a unit marching" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for past tense verbs (in this case, "saw") followed by the subject ("a unit"), and then the verb complement ("marching").
0	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" is singular and should be paired with the third-person singular form of the verb, which is "piace" (like) instead of the plural form "piacciono". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "A Maria piace che Leonardo ritorni."
1	The sentence "Sofia corre a mangiare" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule of Italian language where the verb form corresponds to its subject. In this case, the third person singular present tense of the verb "correre" (to run) agrees with the subject "Sofia". Additionally, the preposition "a" followed by an infinitive verb indicates purpose or intention, which is appropriate here.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "sorride", and they are both in singular form. Additionally, there is an object of the action, which is "Sofia". All these elements make this phrase complete and coherent.
1	The sentence "Beatrice takes care that the article is clear" is grammatically correct. There are no errors in subject-verb agreement, word choice, or syntax. The verb "takes" agrees with its singular subject "Beatrice," and the relative clause "that the article is clear" provides additional information about what Beatrice takes care of. Therefore, this sentence can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro divorzia da Paola." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule and uses the appropriate form of the verb "divorziare" which agrees with the singular masculine noun "Alessandro". Additionally, the preposition "da" followed by the name "Paola" indicates that they are separating from each other, which is consistent with the meaning of divorce.
1	The sentence "Riccardo abita in una casa piccola" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "abita" is the third person singular form of the verb "abitare," which agrees with its subject "Riccardo." Additionally, the article "una" preceding "casa" correctly indicates that we are referring to one house only.
1	The sentence "Maria doesn't live in Rome." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure for negations and includes proper subject-verb agreement with the third person singular verb form "doesn't" agreeing with the subject "Maria".
1	The sentence "Mille stelle brillano nel cielo." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. In this sentence, "mille" (one thousand) is an adjective that modifies the noun "stelle" (stars), and both words agree in number and gender. Also, the verb "brillano" (shine) agrees with its subject "stelle" in person and number. Therefore, there are no apparent errors or violations of standard Italian language usage in this sentence.
0	The subject "ciò" requires the third person singular verb form "guarda", not the second person informal form "guardi". Additionally, there should be a question mark at the end of the sentence since it is an interrogative phrase.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although there are some minor adjustments that could be made for clarity and flow (such as changing "intensely" to an adverb like "intently" and removing the repeated "the specific circumstances), these changes would not make the sentence incorrect. Overall, it clearly communicates that Leonardo studies something for three hours every day with intensity.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La parete" which means "the wall" in English is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the singular verb form "è". Also, "toccata" which is the past participle form of the verb "toccare", agrees with the gender (feminine) and number (singular) of the subject "la parete".
1	The sentence "Lorenzo tocca la schiena di Paola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are correctly conjugated according to gender and number.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because the subject of the clause "not wanting to go" does not have an explicit form. It can be corrected by saying "Their not wanting to go causes a fuss." or "They don't want to go because it would cause a fuss".
1	The sentence "Gabriele mangia poca frutta." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language. Here, "mangia" (third person singular form) agrees with its subject "Gabriele", and "poca" correctly modifies the noun "frutta". Therefore, I would label this sentence as acceptable.
1	The sentence "Andrea beve" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule in Italian where the verb must agree with the number and gender of its subject.
