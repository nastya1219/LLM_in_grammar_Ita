0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it uses the conjunction 'e' (and) between two verbs 'compro' and 'leggo'. In Italian, when two verbs are connected by 'and', they must share the same subject. However, in this sentence, the subject of the verbs is different (Masha and Jane). To make the sentence grammatically correct, it should be written as: "Compro e leggo quel libro io e Masha/Jane." This way, the subject of both verbs is clear and consistent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correct form of the verb 'incontrare' for the past tense ('ho incontrato') and the negation ('non') is correctly placed before the verb.

The verb "è" is the correct form for the third person singular of the verb "essere" (to be) in the present indicative. Overall, the sentence is grammatically and semantically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "domandi" should be in the third person singular form, "domanda", to agree with the subject "Francesco". Additionally, the auxiliary verb "penso" should agree with the subject "Masha" and be "penso" instead of "penso". The correct sentence would be "Penso che Francesco domandi l'ora a Lorenzo." However, this sentence would still have a syntax error because "domandi" should be "domanda" to agree with the subject "Francesco". The correct sentence would be "Penso che Francesco domandi l'ora a Lorenzo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Tommaso" is paired with the verb "ha affermato" (has stated), and the relative clause "che Edoardo parla" (that Edoardo speaks) is also grammatically correct.

The sentence structure is clear and the grammar is accurate.
1	Correct	The sentence "La sedia su cui ti sei seduto è rotta." is grammatically correct. It follows Italian syntax rules, where the subject (la sedia) is followed by the relative pronoun (su cui), the reflexive verb (ti sei seduto) in the past tense, and the predicate (è rotta). The sentence expresses that the chair you sat on is broken.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a complex sentence that establishes a relationship between two events.

The use of relative pronoun "che" correctly connects the two parts of the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'abbia baciato' does not agree with the subject 'Sofia' in terms of number. It should be 'abbia baciata' to match the feminine singular subject. The correct sentence would be: "Edoardo crede che Sofia abbia baciata."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'sa' is singular, but the subject 'problema' is singular, and 'problema' is an inanimate noun, so it cannot be the subject of 'potremo risolvere'. The correct sentence would be 'Che problema non sappiamo come potremo risolvere?' or 'Qual è il problema che non sappiamo come potremo risolvere?'.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'abbia visto' (have seen) agrees with the singular subject 'lui' (him), but it should agree with a plural subject since 'lui' is masculine plural in Italian. The correct verb form would be 'abbiano visto' (have seen) to match the plural subject.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the subject of the sentence, "Abbiamo" (we), is plural, but the verb "visto" (seen) is in the singular form. The correct verb form should be "abbiamo visto" to agree with the plural subject.

The sentence structure and word order are also correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the conjugation of the verb 'avere' in the past tense is not consistent. Instead of 'ha mi avuto', it should be 'ho avuto' or 'abbiamo avuto' (depending on whether Beatrice is talking about herself or herself and the others). Additionally, the use of 'che se stessa' is redundant, so it can be removed. The corrected sentence would be: "Beatrice ha dichiarato di non aver avuto niente a che fare con Gabriele."

0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'mangia' (eats) is in singular form, but 'il coniglio' (the rabbit) is a singular subject. The verb should be in the third person singular form, 'mangia', to match the subject. A correct version would be 'Il coniglio mangia.'
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject. In Italian, the sentence should start with 'Quale' or 'Che libro' to form a coherent question. A correct version could be: 'Quale libro dice che il professore ha raccomandato di leggere?' or 'Che libro è quello che il professore ha raccomandato di leggere?'

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that the current king of France is bald. The subject "l'attuale re di Francia" (the current king of France) agrees with the verb "è" (is) in number and gender, and the adjective "calvo" (bald) agrees with the subject in gender.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct.

The sentence translates to "Some students have passed the exam" and is a grammatically correct Italian sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it does not convey a logical meaning. If "some students did not pass the exam," it does not mean that "every student did not pass the exam." It is a contradiction in terms. The sentence is semantically incorrect.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The reported speech is accurately represented, and the verb tense and agreement are consistent with the context.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks an appropriate subject. In Italian, the verb 'fare' (to do/make) needs a subject, and 'casa' (house) is an object in this sentence. A correct version would be 'Una bella casa è comoda' (A beautiful house is comfortable).
1	Correct	The sentence "Prendiamo questo" is grammatically correct. "Prendiamo" is the first person plural of the present tense verb "prendere" (to take) and "questo" means "this". The sentence translates to "Let's take this."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the subject "I" (using the verb "uso") requires the first person singular form of the verb "use," which is "uso" in the present indicative.

0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because "Andando a casa" (meaning "Going home") and "ho incontrato tuo fratello" (meaning "I met your brother") do not logically connect. The sentence should have a conjunction or a more appropriate transition to link the two events. A possible correction could be: "Andando a casa, ho incontrato tuo fratello che stava tornando a casa." This way, the two events are connected through the action of returning home.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sto andando a prendere la macchina" is grammatically correct. It means "I'm going to pick up the car" in Italian. The verb "sto" is the first person singular present indicative form of "stare" (to be) used for continuous actions, "andando" is the gerund form of "andare" (to go), "a prendere" is the infinitive form of "prendere" (to pick up) with the preposition "a" indicating purpose, and "la macchina" is the direct object in the accusative case, meaning "the car."

0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject. In English, the sentence "Go home!" would require a subject like "You" or "They" to be grammatically correct. However, in Italian, the sentence "Va' a casa!" is considered acceptable as an imperative command without a subject. So, the label is 0 for incorrect in the context of English grammar but would be 1 for correct in the context of Italian grammar.
1	Correct	The sentence "Io sono affamato" is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject (Io) and a predicate (sono affamato). The verb "sono" agrees with the singular subject "Io" and the adjective "affamato" correctly agrees with the subject in gender and number.

1	Correct	The sentence "Ho visto una casa" is grammatically correct. The verb "ho visto" (I have seen) agrees with the singular subject "una casa" (a house) in both number and person. The use of the article "una" before "casa" is also correct in Italian.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Egli" means "He" in English, and "lo vide" means "saw him." The sentence follows the correct subject-verb-object structure in Italian, and the verb is conjugated properly according to the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Alessandro is the subject, 'promette' is the verb, 'ad Edoardo' is the indirect object, and 'di restare a casa' is the infinitive clause functioning as the direct object. The sentence has proper agreement in number and tense.

The verb "aperto" (meaning "opened") is in the past participle and agrees with the subject in gender and number. The sentence is a complete and coherent thought, making it grammatically correct and acceptable.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'è stato dato' (has been given) is in the singular form, but the subject 'le' (to her) is plural. To make it grammatically correct, you should use 'sono state date' (have been given) as the plural form of the verb. The correct sentence would be: 'Le sono state date il cappello da me.'
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it's a mixture of Italian and English. In Italian, the sentence should be "Quale ragazzo apre la porta?" or "Qual ragazzo apre la porta?" to ask which boy is opening the door. The English word "the" should be translated to "la" in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence where the subject is 'i ragazzi' (the boys), the verb is 'ho sentito cantare' (I have heard sing), and the sentence has a complete meaning. The subject agrees with the verb, and the sentence structure is correct.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a question asking if the person being addressed knows Lorenzo. The sentence structure is appropriate, and there are no morphological or semantic errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a proper subject. The correct sentence would be "Da quando vive in America?" which translates to "Since when have you been living in America?" If you meant to ask someone else about their time in America, the sentence should be "E da quando lei vive in America?" which translates to "And since when does she live in America?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It's a question asking if the speaker believes something is possible. The subject "tu" (you) is implied, and the verb "credi" (do you believe) is in the second person singular form, which agrees with the implied subject. The rest of the sentence is also structured correctly.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'lasciò' should be in the plural form 'lasciarono' to agree with the plural subject 'Masha e Jane'. The corrected sentence would be: 'Appena detto ciò, Masha e Jane mi lasciarono che piangevo e volevo dire molte cose.'
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a complete sentence with a clear subject ("Sei") and predicate ("sempre lo stesso: un amico fidato, paziente e onesto").

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Ho preso" (I took) is in the past tense, and the object "una specie di gatto" (a kind of cat) is a singular noun with the indefinite article "una." The sentence structure and grammar are accurate in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho preso dello zucchero" is grammatically correct. It is in the first person singular past tense, meaning "I took some sugar." The verb "prendere" (to take) is correctly conjugated, and the sentence structure is correct. Therefore, this sentence is acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "Non mi piace il vino" is grammatically correct. It is a simple negative sentence in Italian, meaning "I don't like wine." The subject "mi" is the indirect object pronoun, and "piace" is the third person singular conjugation of the verb "piacere" (to like). The noun "vino" is the direct object, and it is in the singular form since "il" is the definite article for singular masculine nouns. Therefore, the sentence is structurally correct and conveys a clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It translates to "What I sell is Chinese goods." There are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing a subject. In Italian, verbs generally require a subject, so the sentence should be "Mettere fretta a qualcuno" (Put pressure on someone) or "Mettere fretta a Masha e Jane" (Put pressure on Masha and Jane) to include a subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "È stato bandito un concorso" translates to "A competition has been banned" in English. The verb "è stato bandito" agrees with the singular subject "un concorso" in both tense and number.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Tutte le balene" (all the whales) is plural and agrees with the verb "devono essere protette" (must be protected). The sentence is coherent and makes sense.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it is in Italian ("Mettitelo bene in capo") but the context of the conversation seems to be in English. The sentence should either be translated to English or the conversation should be in Italian.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because the adjectives 'vecchia' and 'nuova' are contradictory in this context. It's like saying the car is both old and new, which is a semantic contradiction. A more appropriate sentence would be: "Questa macchina è vecchia ma ben tenuta," meaning "This car is old but well-maintained."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that Leonardo does not know Maria, and the verb "conosce" agrees with the subject "Leonardo" in number and person.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It's a simple sentence in the present continuous tense, with the subject "Edoardo" and the verb "sta compilando" (is compiling). The sentence structure and word usage are accurate.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject. In English, the sentence would be "They emit a fragrance." The subject "they" is implied in Italian, but it is still necessary for the sentence to be grammatically correct. A more complete Italian sentence would be "Emanano un profumo."
1	Correct	The sentence "Aprire un nuovo negozio" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Open a new store" and is a complete sentence with a subject ("tu" or "you" implied) and an infinitive verb "aprire" (to open).

1	Correct	The sentence "Le giornate si sono accorciate" is grammatically correct. The subject "giornate" is plural, so the verb "sono" agrees with it in number, and the past participle "accorciate" also agrees with the plural subject. The sentence means "The days have shortened" in English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Qualcosa' (something) is the subject, 'ha accorciato' (has shortened) is the verb in the past tense, and 'le giornate' (the days) is the direct object. The sentence structure and agreement between subject, verb, and object are correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Qualcuno ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct. It uses the correct verb form "ha accorciato" (third person singular, present perfect) with the plural subject "qualcuno" (someone) and the plural object "le giornate" (the days). The sentence structure and agreement between subject, verb, and object are correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it is a dangling participle phrase. The participle 'aggrapparsi' (grasping) should be connected to a subject, but there is no subject in this sentence. To correct it, a subject should be added, such as "Lui/Lei si aggrappa a un ramo" (He/She grasps a branch).
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because 'le navi' is plural, so the verb 'sono' should be used instead of 'e' to agree with the plural subject. The correct sentence would be 'Arenatesi le navi, gli equipaggi sono scesi a terra.'
1	Correct	The sentence "La nebbia è svanita" is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence in Italian with a subject ("nebbia" - the fog), a verb ("è svanita" - has disappeared), and the sentence is in the past tense. The subject and the verb agree in number and gender, making the sentence syntactically and morphologically correct.
0	Morphology	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'piange' should be conjugated in the third person singular form ('si piange') instead of the second person singular form ('si piangi'). The correct form would be 'Alessandro si piange sempre'.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. Riccardo is the subject, and the verb "si lagna" is in the third person singular form, which agrees with the subject. The sentence structure and word choice are appropriate, making the sentence correct.

1	Correct	The sentence "L'acqua è sgorgata all'improvviso" is grammatically correct. It is a simple Italian sentence, where "L'acqua" (the water) is the subject, "è sgorgata" (has gushed out) is the verb in the third person singular form, and "all'improvviso" (suddenly) is the adverb describing when the action occurred. The sentence structure and word choice are appropriate, making the sentence correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks proper subject-verb agreement. In Italian, the verb 'to yawn' (sbadigliare) should agree with the subject 'Andrea' (masculine singular). The correct form of the verb should be 'sbadigliato' (masculine singular past participle). The correct sentence should be 'Andrea ha sbadigliato?'.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is a subject, and "pedala" is the third person singular form of the verb "pedalare" (to pedal), which agrees in number with the subject. So, the sentence is properly formed.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "è approfittato" is in the singular form, but the subject "l'esperienza" is singular and therefore the verb should be in the singular form. The correct form would be "Ha approfittato dell'esperienza."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject 'Il figlio di Francesco' is singular, and the verb 'si siede' agrees with it in number. The time expression 'alle 8 in punto' is also correctly placed at the end of the sentence. The sentence is a clear and complete statement about the son of Francesco sitting in the first row at exactly 8 o'clock.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject 'il figlio di Leonardo' agrees with the verb 'sedeva' in terms of number and person, and the sentence is structurally sound.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Il muro ammuffisce in una giornata" instead of "Il muro ammuffisce in una giornata." The adjective "ammuffisce" agrees in gender and number with the subject "muro" (masculine singular), but the sentence is attempting to say that the wall molds in one day, which doesn't make sense. A more appropriate sentence would be "Il muro diventa muffito in una giornata."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the Italian syntax rules and has proper verb conjugation. The subject (Paola) is singular, and the verb "sta suonando" agrees with the subject in number and person. The object "un pezzo di Bach" is also in the correct form.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. "Il coro canta molto bene" means "The choir sings very well" in English.

1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo non ha cucinato" is grammatically correct. It follows the correct subject-verb agreement, with the subject "Lorenzo" in the singular form and the verb "ha cucinato" conjugated in the third person singular past tense. The negation is correctly formed with the negative particle "non" and the auxiliary verb "ha" followed by the past participle "cucinato."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because "lettera" is a feminine noun, and "scrive" is a 3rd person singular verb form. The correct verb form should be "scrive" for a singular subject or "scrivono" for a plural subject. The sentence should be "La lettera scrive" if it refers to a singular subject, or "Le lettere scrivono" if it refers to multiple subjects.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incomplete and lacks proper grammatical structure in English. It appears to be a question, but there is no verb or subject present. The sentence should be rephrased or completed to be grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo sta compilando" is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence in Italian, where "Leonardo" is the subject, "sta" is the auxiliary verb for the present continuous tense, and "compilando" is the gerund form of the verb "compilare" (to compile). The sentence translates to "Leonardo is compiling" in English, which is a proper and coherent statement.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows Italian sentence structure and uses the correct verb form "scrive" to indicate the third person singular present tense. The negation "non" is correctly placed before the verb "scrive," and the adverb "più" is used correctly to indicate a longer period of time. The phrase "da un pezzo" means "for a while" and is used correctly in this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that the train driver (il macchinista) has stopped (si è fermato). The sentence follows the correct subject-verb agreement, and the meaning is clear and coherent.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "i bicchieri" is plural and agrees with the reflexive verb "si sono rotti" in the plural form.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in Italian. The subject is "Paola," the verb is "ha acceso," and the object is "il fuoco." The sentence has proper agreement between the subject and the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "il soggiorno in Canada" (the stay in Canada) is singular, and the verb "ha migliorato" (has improved) agrees with it in number and person. The sentence is also semantically coherent, as it describes an improvement in the person's English language skills due to their stay in Canada.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject. In Italian, a subject is necessary for a sentence to be complete and grammatically correct. A possible correction could be: "La lezione ha continuato." (The lesson continued.)
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it is written in Italian ("Saltare un ostacolo") and is not a grammatically correct English sentence. In English, it would be "Jump over an obstacle."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "si sono commossi" agrees with the plural subject "tutti." The sentence means "Everyone was moved."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks proper agreement between the subject and the verb. 'Si è macchiata' means 'It got stained' which doesn't agree with the plural subject 'la tovaglia' (the tablecloth). The correct form should be 'Si sono macchiate la tovaglia' to agree with the plural subject.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it translates to "Spot the wine" in English. It seems like a command to make the wine spotty. However, if you want to say "The wine is spotting" or "The wine has spots," you should use the verb "macchiare" instead of "macchia" and add an article to make the subject plural, as "Il vino" is singular. In this case, the correct sentence would be "I vini sono macchiati" or "I vini si macchiano" to convey the intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "L'acqua" (the water) is singular, and the verb "è" (is) agrees with it in number. The adjective "gelata" (frozen) agrees with the subject in gender (feminine) and number (singular). The prepositional phrase "in due ore" (in two hours) is correctly used to indicate the time it took for the water to freeze.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because 'le tappe' (the stages) cannot 'bruciare' (burn). This is a semantic error because the action described does not match the subject of the sentence. A more appropriate verb would be something like 'durato' (lasted) or 'richiesto' (required) to convey the passage of time for each stage. Correct sentence: 'Le tappe hanno richiesto un'ora.'
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il vetro si rompe" translates to "The glass breaks" in English. The subject "il vetro" is singular and the verb "si rompe" agrees with it in number.

The sentence translates to "Riccardo cut his chin with a razor," which is a coherent and complete sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb 'si è calmato' is reflexive and in the past tense, which is appropriate for the subject 'Francesco'.

1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco ha bruciato la torta" is grammatically correct. It follows the correct Italian sentence structure, where the subject (Francesco), verb (ha bruciato), and object (la torta) are all in the appropriate order.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian. The subject 'Tommaso' agrees with the verb 'è ingrassato' in number and tense. The phrase 'dall'ultima volta che l'ho vista' is a dependent clause that correctly describes when the weight gain occurred. Overall, the sentence is syntactically and semantically correct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it is semantically illogical to break a television in an hour. A more appropriate way to express this would be "La televisione si è rotta dopo un'ora di utilizzo." This means "The television broke after an hour of use."

The sentence provided is grammatically incorrect due to the mismatch between the question word "chi" and the subject pronoun "che".

0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'sostiene' is in the third person singular form, but the subject 'Tommaso' is singular and requires the verb to be in the third person singular form. The correct verb form should be 'sostiene' or 'sostengono' if the subject is intended to be plural (including 'vi').

The preposition "dal" is correctly used to indicate the source of the action (from the drawer). The noun "soldi" (money) is correctly used in the accusative case, which is the correct case for the direct object of the sentence.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Riccardo" is singular, and the verb "taglia" agrees with it in number. The prepositional phrase "a fetta" is correct in meaning and structure.

0	Morphology	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "travestì" is in the third person singular form, while the subject "Alice" is in the third person singular form as well.

0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because 'raso rosso' (red satin) is not a subject that can perform an action like 'foderava i cuscini' (stuffed the cushions). The sentence needs a subject that can perform the action, such as 'una donna' (a woman) or 'un sarto' (a tailor).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Lorenzo" is the subject, "dissemina" is the verb in the third person singular form, and the rest of the sentence provides information about what Lorenzo does (disseminates funny anecdotes) and where (in his stories). The sentence structure is coherent and makes sense.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'disseminano' (disseminate) does not agree with its subject 'i turisti' (the tourists). The correct verb form should be 'disseminano' (third person plural). The corrected sentence would be: "I turisti disseminano il prato di cartacce."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the subject "Gabriele" is singular, but the verb "nutrì" is in the plural form. The correct sentence should be "Gabriele nutrì il figlio dell'idea di essere il più bravo ed intelligente di tutti." with the singular verb "nutrì" to match the singular subject "Gabriele".

0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'fa' does not agree with the plural subject 'l'alchimista'. The correct verb form should be 'fanno' in the third person plural. The corrected sentence would be: 'Gli alchimisti fanno che l'oro derivi dal piombo.'
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Riccardo is the subject, and the sentence uses the appropriate verb form "spostò" (past tense of "spostare" - to move) and the correct prepositions "dall'armadio" (from the wardrobe) and "al tavolo" (to the table). The sentence structure and grammar are all accurate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that the 'foresteria' (guesthouse) hosts the people attending the 'manifestazione' (event). The sentence structure and verb conjugation are appropriate for the subject and context.

The sentence is clear, concise, and follows the rules of Italian grammar.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the Italian sentence structure and uses proper verb conjugation and agreement with the subject.

1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele ci sostituisce il tubo catodico" is grammatically correct. The subject is "Gabriele," and the verb "sostituisce" agrees in number and person with the subject.

The direct object is "Beatrice" and the indirect object is "con Paola." The sentence is well-constructed and has no errors in its morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'L'amore lega' means 'Love binds' or 'Love ties' in English. The subject, 'l'amore,' is in the singular form, and the verb, 'lega,' is conjugated in the third person singular form, which agrees with the subject. The sentence is a simple statement in Italian, and there are no grammatical errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele dorme" is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence in Italian, with the subject "Gabriele" and the verb "dorme" (sleep). The verb agrees with the singular subject, and the sentence structure is correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is a singular subject, and "desidera" is the third person singular form of the verb "desiderare" (to desire) in the present tense. The sentence translates to "Maria wants a book" in English, which is a coherent and grammatically correct sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Maria is the subject, desidera is the verb, il fatto is the direct object, and che tu venga is the subordinate clause. The verb conjugation agrees with the singular subject Maria, and the subordinate clause is correctly constructed with the subjunctive mood.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it is in Italian, but the sentence is in Spanish. In Spanish, it should be "Leonardo tiene la posibilidad de que lo promuevan." The sentence is grammatically correct in Spanish, but the language is incorrect.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "vedrà" (will see) is in the third person singular form, but it should be in the third person plural form "vedranno" to agree with the plural subject "Edoardo" and "Giulia". The correct sentence would be "Giulia abbandona l'idea che vedranno Edoardo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that Maria made the statement that Francesco is beautiful. The subject (Maria) agrees with the verb (ha fatto) in both number and person, and the subordinate clause is also structured correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Maria" is singular, and the verb "bada" agrees with the subject in number and person. The clause "che tutto funzioni alla perfezione" is a dependent clause with a plural verb "funzioni" which agrees with the plural subject "tutto" (everything). The sentence conveys a clear meaning, and there are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'approva' should agree with the subject 'Edoardo' in both number and gender. In this case, the verb should be 'approva' instead of 'approva', which is the masculine singular form. The correct sentence would be 'Edoardo approva che Maria parta' or 'Edoardo approva che Maria partano' if Maria is also plural.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "dubita" does not agree with the subject "Emma" in number. The correct verb form should be "dubita" (third person singular) instead of "dubita" (third person plural). The correct sentence should be: "Emma dubita che Alice parta."
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it is difficult to understand the intended meaning due to the unusual word arrangement and lack of context. The words "Lorenzo", "viaggi", "angoscia", and "Tommaso" are not connected in a clear way, making it challenging to derive a coherent message. A rephrased or restructured sentence would be necessary to make it grammatically acceptable and semantically meaningful.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because there is a missing pronoun before 'ciò'. A more grammatically correct version of the sentence would be "Riccardo approva l'idea, ciò." This means that Riccardo approves the idea, and that is what 'ciò' refers to. In this case, the pronoun 'ciò' is used to refer back to the previously mentioned idea.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the subject and verb should be in agreement. In this case, "Edoardo" is the subject, so the verb should be "approva" instead of "approva il fatto che Maria canti." The correct sentence would be: "Edoardo approva il fatto che Maria canti."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "desideri" should be in the plural form "desiderate" to match the plural subject "Tu e Sofia." Additionally, the verb should be conjugated with "che" to connect the clauses properly, resulting in "Tu e Sofia desiderate che Sofia venga."
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because "fumo" means "smoke," and the phrase "andare al fumo" is not a common or grammatically correct way to say "smoke a cigarette" in Italian. Instead, one could say "Riccardo fuma una sigaretta" or "Riccardo fuma un sigaro" to convey the intended meaning.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it is in Italian, not in English. The correct translation to English would be "Alice longs to return."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'si sposi' should agree with the subject 'Maria', which is singular. The correct verb form should be 'sia sposa' to match the gender and number of the subject. The corrected sentence would be: "Andrea incoraggia Maria a che sia sposa."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing a verb to complete the subject "il fatto che Emma parli". A possible correction would be "Il fatto che Emma parli allieta suo padre" or "Il fatto che Emma parli allieta suo padre." (with the addition of a period or a semicolon).
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject. In Italian, sentences need a subject, and since 'andare al cinema' is an infinitive verb, it cannot act as a subject. A possible correct version could be 'Sofia si infiamma andando al cinema' or 'Andare al cinema infiamma Sofia'. In the first option, 'Sofia' is the subject, and in the second option, 'infiamma' is the main verb, and 'andare al cinema' is its object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "La" (referring to someone) is followed by the verb "colpisce" (in the third person singular form), and the relative clause "che Riccardo rida" (that Riccardo laughs) provides additional information about what strikes the subject. The verb "ridere" is correctly conjugated in the third person singular form "rida."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "meraviglia" agrees with the plural subject "mi," and the verb "sia" agrees with the singular subject "Beatrice." The sentence is a clear and complete thought, and there are no obvious errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it seems to be a mix of two separate sentences, and the subject and verb do not match. The correct sentence would be "Leonardo allieta Maria perché Maria ride" or "Leonardo allieta Leonardo perché Maria ride." The first one suggests that Maria's laughter makes Leonardo happy, while the second one implies that Maria's laughter makes the other Leonardo happy.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because "tristezza e noia" (sadness and boredom) are two separate feelings, and it is semantically incorrect to say that they are depreciating Gabriele. It would be better to separate the two feelings or use a more appropriate phrasing. Correct examples could be: "La tristezza e la noia possono deprimere Gabriele" (Sadness and boredom can depress Gabriele) or "La tristezza e la noia deprimono Gabriele separatamente" (Sadness and boredom depress Gabriele separately).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is an Italian sentence that translates to "It calms me that Giulia speaks in this way." The verb "acquieta" agrees with the singular subject "Mi," and the verb "parli" agrees with the singular subject "Giulia." The sentence structure is coherent and there are no apparent morphological, syntactic, or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "La sola presenza di Alice mi acquieta" is grammatically correct. The phrase "la sola presenza" translates to "the mere presence" and "mi acquieta" means "calms me down." The sentence structure and word choice are appropriate in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "ballerine" (dancers) is plural, and the verb "è" (is) agrees with it in number, being conjugated as "sono" (are). The sentence translates to "Talking with the dancers is fun."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the subject 'Io' and the verb 'vengo' do not agree in person. In Italian, the first person singular form of the verb 'venire' should be 'vengo', but since the subject is 'Io', the verb should be in the first person singular form, which is 'vengo'. The correct sentence should be 'Io sono affascinato dal fatto che Edoardo parli di poesia.'
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "di vedere" should be conjugated as "vedere" and the subject "Paola" is singular, so it should be "accadde a Paola" instead of "accadde a Paola". The corrected sentence should be "Vedere i marziani accadde a Paola."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because there is a verb tense agreement error. The correct sentence should be 'Aveva vinto al lotto e splendeva nel suo sguardo.' The past tense of 'avere' ('aver') does not agree with the past participle 'vinto.' The sentence should use the imperfect tense 'aveva vinto' to show the continuous action of splendeva in the past.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it is a literal translation from Italian to English, which doesn't make sense in English. A more appropriate translation would be, "The joy of having won the lottery shone in her eyes." The original Italian sentence is grammatically correct, but the direct translation is not.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because "si tratta" is a fixed expression, and it should be followed by the preposition "che" and a subjunctive verb. In this case, "dobbiamo" is not in the subjunctive form. The correct sentence should be: "Si tratta che dobbiamo fuggire." or "Si tratta di fuggire."
1	Correct	The sentence "Si tratta di fuggire" is grammatically correct. It is an idiomatic expression in Italian, meaning "it is about escaping" or "it deals with escaping." The verb "tratta" agrees with the subject "si" (reflexive pronoun) and the preposition "di" followed by the infinitive "fuggire" is used correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense. The structure and usage of words are appropriate. The sentence translates to "The fact that Emma left so early indicates that she is not getting along with you at the moment." There are no mistakes in morphology, syntax, or semantics.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Io condanno il fatto che Erode abbia ucciso i bambini" instead of "Io condanno il fatto che Erode uccise i bambini". The verb "uccise" should be in the present perfect subjunctive form "abbia ucciso" to match the present conditional "condanno".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "adora" agrees with the singular subject "Gabriele" and the preposition "ad Andrea" is used correctly. The sentence structure and word choice are appropriate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Andrea" is singular, and the verb "intende" agrees with the subject in number. The sentence is a simple statement in which Andrea plans to marry Alice. There are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic issues in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'evita' is in the third person singular form, but it should be in the third person plural form 'evitano' to agree with the plural subject 'Riccardo'. The correct sentence would be: 'Riccardo e Jane evitano guardare la televisione'.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it contains two verb conjugations ('si parta' and 'è') that do not agree in tense. The correct sentence should have 'si parte' to match the present tense of 'è'. The corrected sentence would be: 'Paola ritiene che si parta è carino.' However, this sentence still has an issue with the verb conjugation. The correct sentence should be: 'Paola ritiene che sia carino partire.'
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it contains a syntactic error. The verb 'riteneva' (considered) is in the singular form, but the subject 'Lorenzo' is singular, so the verb should also be singular. It should be 'riteneva' instead of 'ritenevano'. The corrected sentence would be: 'Lorenzo riteneva Alice fosse Paola'.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks the subject pronoun 'lo' or 'la' before 'giudica'. It should be 'Beatrice lo giudica che Maria ha troppi amanti.' or 'Beatrice la giudica che Maria ha troppi amanti.' depending on the gender of the person or thing being judged. The sentence is trying to convey that Beatrice judges Maria for having too many lovers. The missing subject pronoun 'lo' or 'la' creates a syntactic error in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "giudica" should be conjugated as "giudicano" since the subject "Sofia e Maria" is plural. The correct sentence would be: "Sofia e Maria lo giudicano che Maria abbia troppi amanti."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks the subject-verb agreement. In this sentence, "Giulia" is the subject and "giudica" is the verb, but the verb should agree with the subject in number. In this case, the verb should be "giudica" instead of "giudica" to agree with the singular subject "Giulia". The correct sentence would be "Giulia lo giudica evidente che Maria sia bella."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "suppone" should agree with its subject "Leonardo" in number. Therefore, it should be "Leonardo lo suppone che il padre beva troppo" instead of "Leonardo lo suppone che il padre beva troppo". The verb "suppone" should be changed to "suppongono" to agree with the singular subject "Leonardo".
1	Correct	The sentence "Io penso qualcosa di te" is grammatically correct. The subject "Io" agrees with the verb "penso" in the first person singular. The preposition "di" is correctly used to introduce the object "te" and "qualcosa" is an appropriate noun to refer to "something."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because of the incorrect use of the verb tense. The verb 'penso' should be in the present tense (penso), but the conjugation 'penso' already indicates that the speaker is thinking in the present. The correct sentence would be 'Io penso che tu ami il tartufo.' The incorrect use of the verb tense disrupts the syntax of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with the subject 'Emma,' the verb 'ottiene' (obtains), and the object 'qualcosa' (something) from 'te' (you). The sentence structure and verb conjugation are appropriate for the subject, making it an acceptable sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it violates subject-verb agreement. In Italian, the verb 'lavorare' should be in the third person singular form 'lavora' when the subject is singular (Alice), but it should be in the third person plural form 'lavorano' when the subject is plural (Maria e Alice). The correct sentence should be: "Alice e Maria lavorano a cacciare."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Riccardo is the subject, 'plaude' is the verb, and 'al fatto che Tommaso ha vinto' is the object clause. The verb agrees with the subject in number and person, and the sentence follows the correct Italian sentence structure.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'aspirare' (to aspire) requires a reflexive pronoun in Italian. Therefore, it should be 'Maria ci aspira' instead of 'Maria ci aspira'. The correct sentence would be 'Maria si aspira' (Maria aspires).
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria ci si aggrappa" is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject, "ci" is an indirect object pronoun, and "si aggrappa" is the verb conjugated in the third person singular form. The sentence structure and verb conjugation are consistent with Italian grammar rules.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Paola spera che il futuro sia felice" instead of "Paola mira a che il futuro sia felice". The verb "mira" (aims) doesn't fit well in this context, as it implies a more active and deliberate action, while "spera" (hopes) is more appropriate for expressing a wish or desire for the future to be happy.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "guardava" agrees with the singular subject "Giulia," and the sentence structure is accurate.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because there should be a verb between the two names. A correct version would be: "Riccardo lo pensa, Tommaso." This adds a comma and the verb "pensa" (thinks), connecting the two subjects and making the sentence grammatically correct.
1	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'acconsentire' requires the subjunctive form 'acconsenta' to match the subject 'Paola'. Additionally, 'leghino' should be 'legassero' to match the subjunctive mood. A correct version would be: 'Paola acconsente a che la leghino.' Label: 1 Category: Correct Explanation: The corrected sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correct verb form 'acconsenta' and the correct subjunctive form 'legassero'. The sentence now reads: 'Paola acconsente a che la leghino.'
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Alice (a singular subject) is correctly paired with "sorride" (a singular verb form). The phrase "del fatto di aver pianto" correctly indicates the reason for Alice's smile.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "la condizione di disagio" is singular, and the verb "nasce" agrees with it in number and tense. The prepositional phrase "dalla mancanza d'acqua" is correctly formed and provides additional information about the cause of the condition.
1	Correct	The sentence "Da quest'analisi risulta il nostro partire" is grammatically correct. It is a coherent sentence with proper syntax and morphology. The subject is "il nostro partire" (our departure), and the verb "risulta" (results) agrees with it in number and person. The prepositional phrase "Da quest'analisi" (from this analysis) functions as the adverbial modifier of the sentence. Overall, the sentence is grammatically sound and conveys a clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It translates to "The cough depends on the fact of having smoked too much." The sentence structure and word choice are appropriate, and there are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because there should be a preposition "a" before "Paola" to show the indirect object. The corrected sentence should be: "Leonardo chiarisce che non è colpa sua a Paola." Label: 1 Category: Correct Explanation: The sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Leonardo clarifies that it's not his fault to Paola."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Andrea is the subject who is whistling (fischia) to Maria, who is experiencing hunger (ha fame). The sentence structure and verb conjugation are appropriate for the context.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a conjunction or a coordinating conjunction to connect the two clauses: "Andrea accennerà ad Edoardo" and "se partirà o no." A correct sentence could be: "Andrea accennerà ad Edoardo e partirà o no."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "addebita" agrees with the subject "Paola" in number (singular) and person (third person). The preposition "a" is correctly used to indicate the indirect object "Leonardo." The sentence is syntactically and semantically coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject 'Riccardo' agrees with the verb 'aggiunge' in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the pronoun 'lo' correctly refers to the direct object 'discorso'.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria ce lo ha scommesso" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Maria bet on it." The verb "ha scommesso" agrees with the subject "Maria" in terms of tense and number.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. It is a statement about journalists attacking the fact that many politicians are corrupt in newspapers. The sentence structure, grammar, and syntax are all correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. It follows the correct subject-verb agreement and the proper use of conjunctions. Paola is the subject and "incoraggia" is the verb, and "il fatto che i ragazzi vadano al mare" is a dependent clause that serves as the object of the verb. The verb "vadano" agrees with the plural subject "i ragazzi," and the conjunction "che" is used correctly to introduce the dependent clause.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "avvisa" is in the third person singular form, but the subject "Emma" is a singular feminine noun, so the verb should be in the third person singular feminine form, which is "avvisa". The correct sentence would be "Emma non avvisa Alessandro".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is the subject, "lo convince" is the verb, and "che lo sciopero è giusto" is the complement. The pronoun "lo" correctly refers to the direct object "lo sciopero" using the masculine singular form.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'esime' should be conjugated as 'esimiamo' to agree with the plural subject 'Riccardo e Riccardo' (Riccardo and Riccardo). The corrected sentence would be: "Riccardo e Riccardo esimiamo Riccardo dal viaggio."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "The mayor exempts the poor from paying for the bus." The sentence structure and word usage are appropriate, and there are no apparent morphological, syntactic, or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian, and the structure and word choice are appropriate for the language. The subject Maria agrees with Leonardo for the program to be carried out. The verb "si accorda" is in the third person singular form, which agrees with the singular subject Maria. The verb "sia" in the subjunctive mood is used correctly in the clause "affinché il programma sia realizzato."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'discorre' should be in the plural form 'discorrono' to agree with the plural subject 'Alice e Giulia'.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It states that Maria realizes she is in love because she blushes. There are no apparent morphological, syntactical, or semantic issues.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that Edoardo continues to eat it, which is a clear and coherent sentence in Italian. The verb "continua" agrees with the subject "Edoardo" and the pronoun "lo" correctly refers to an object previously mentioned in the conversation.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'indugia' (indulge) is not the correct verb for the action of encouraging someone to eat. A more appropriate verb would be 'incoraggia' (encourage) or 'spinge' (push) to make the sentence semantically correct. The correct sentence would be "Leonardo lo incoraggia a mangiare" or "Leonardo lo spinge a mangiare."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo osa mangiare" is a complete sentence with a subject "Edoardo" and a verb "osa mangiare" in the infinitive form, which agrees with the subject in number.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola è capace di cavalcare" is grammatically correct. The subject Paola is singular, and the verb "è capace" agrees with it. The sentence also has a correct structure and conveys a clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Maria' is a singular subject, and 'ha' agrees with it. The verb 'ha' is the third person singular form of the verb 'avere' (to have), which is appropriate for 'Maria'. The sentence is semantically and syntactically correct as well, so the label is 1 for a correct sentence.
0	Morphology	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'suole' is in the singular form, but it should be in the plural form 'suolono' to agree with the subject 'Tommaso' (which is a masculine singular noun). The corrected sentence would be 'Tommaso suolono il pasto.'
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo deve mangiarlo." is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject (Riccardo), a verb (deve) and an object (mangiarlo). The verb "deve" agrees with the subject "Riccardo" in number and person, and the pronoun "lo" refers correctly to a previously mentioned masculine singular object.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing a verb. The correct sentence should be "Gabriele lo usa per mangiarlo" (Gabriele uses it to eat it). The original sentence is missing the verb "uses" (usa in Italian).
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo va in camera" is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence in Italian, with the subject "Riccardo" and the verb "va" (goes) in the third person singular form, which agrees with the subject. The preposition "in" (into) and the noun "camera" (room) are also correct in the sentence. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject. The subject "Andrea" is present but it should be in the form "Andrea sta vendendo in camera" (Andrea is selling in camera) to be grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject (Riccardo) and a verb (sparisce) in the third person singular form, and an adverbial complement of place (da Parigi). The sentence structure and grammar are all correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Edoardo" is singular, and the verb "parte" agrees with it in number and person. The prepositional phrase "a Parigi" correctly indicates the destination.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes an action (sgambetta - runs) performed by a subject (Paola) towards a destination (il ponte - the bridge). The sentence structure and verb conjugation are appropriate for the subject.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing the subject. A correct version of the sentence would be: "La gente lo corre a salutare" or "La folla lo corre a salutare" (if you mean 'la folla' to be the subject). In Italian, the subject is often omitted when it's clear from the context, but in this case, it's not clear.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso invia Emma in piazza" is grammatically correct. It follows the proper Italian sentence structure (subject-verb-object) and uses appropriate verb conjugation. Tommaso is the subject, invia (sends) is the verb, Emma is the direct object, and in piazza (to the square) is the indirect object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Beatrice is the subject, and the verb 'assembla' agrees with the singular subject in number and person. The object 'un computer' is also correctly used in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il film è di Scorsese" means "The movie is by Scorsese." The subject, "il film" (the movie), agrees with the verb "è" (is), and the preposition "di" (by) is followed by the name of the director, Scorsese. There are no apparent grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola lavora" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola works." The subject, "Paola," is singular and the verb "lavora" agrees with it in number and person.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the pronoun "quel" should be replaced with "quella" to agree with the feminine noun "quadro." The correct sentence would be: "È l'amica che di Emma angoscia quella quadro di Picasso."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "leggono" (read) should agree with the plural subject "loro" (they). The correct form should be "Molte loro leggono il giornale" or "Molte loro leggono i giornali." The first option indicates that they read a certain newspaper, while the second option indicates that they read newspapers in general. The sentence as it is written does not make sense and is not grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'sono' is missing to agree with the plural subject 'alcuni musei'. The correct sentence should be 'Quelli alcuni musei sono stati progettati da architetto.'
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola mangia la pizza" is grammatically correct. It follows Italian grammar rules, where 'mangia' is the third person singular form of the verb 'mangiare' (to eat) and it agrees with the singular subject 'Paola'. 'La pizza' is the direct object of the sentence and is in the correct form. The sentence is a complete and coherent statement.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'progettato' is singular, but it should be plural ('progettati') since the subject 'quel architetto' is singular. The correct sentence would be: 'Quell'architetto ha alcuni progettati musei.'
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because 'molte ragazze' (many girls) is plural, but 'Hanno letto' (they read) is in the third person plural form, and it's followed by 'il giornale' (the newspaper) which is in the singular form. It should be 'i giornali' (the newspapers) to match the plural subject. The correct sentence would be: "Hanno letto, molte ragazze, i giornali l'anno scorso."
1	Correct	The sentence "Le spalle di Riccardo toccano la parete." is grammatically correct. It follows the Italian sentence structure with subject "Le spalle di Riccardo" (Riccardo's shoulders), verb "toccano" (touch) and object "la parete" (the wall). The article "le" agrees with the plural noun "spalle" (shoulders), and the sentence conveys a clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the future tense, with "sarà" (will be) indicating future action. "Maria" is the subject, and "toccata" is the past participle form of the verb "toccare" (to touch). The sentence means "Maria will be touched by that film." There is no morphology, syntax, or semantic error in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb form "sei" should be used instead of "sia" for a singular subject. The verb should agree with the subject "tu" in number and person. The correct sentence would be "Che tu sia partita rallegra Beatrice." However, this sentence is also semantically incorrect as "Che tu sia partita" is a subjunctive clause, which doesn't fit the context of wishing someone happiness. A correct and more natural sentence would be "Sia partita, rallegra Beatrice."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the Italian subject-verb-object word order, and the verb 'è' (is) agrees with the singular subject 'Gabriele'. The sentence states that Gabriele is the husband of Paola.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice è con Lorenzo" is grammatically correct. The verb "è" (is) agrees with the subject "Beatrice" and the preposition "con" (with) is correctly used to indicate that Beatrice is with Lorenzo. The sentence structure is clear and the verb tense is appropriate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject (Paola), a verb (ha messo), and a direct object (la macchina). The sentence also includes a relative clause (che è del fratello) which provides additional information about the direct object. The prepositional phrase (nel garage) indicates the location where the car is placed. All elements are correctly connected, and the sentence is grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a preposition between "obbedisce" and "di Maria." The correct form would be "Tommaso obbedisce a Maria" (Tommaso obeys Maria) or "di Maria" could be replaced with "di Maria" (of Mary) to create "Tommaso obbedisce di Maria," which would mean "Tommaso obeys of Mary," which is still incorrect due to the lack of preposition.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it contains a repetition of the subject Andrea, which makes the sentence unclear and grammatically incorrect. It should be: "Andrea confronta Leonardo con Maria." This way, the sentence has two distinct subjects (Andrea and Maria) and the syntax is correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria fotografa Paola" is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence in Italian, with the subject "Maria" and the verb "fotografa" (photographs) followed by the object "Paola." The word order is standard for Italian sentences, and the verb agrees with the subject in number and person.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Lorenzo" is singular, and the past participle "smanioso" agrees with it in gender and number. The verb "è stato" is correctly conjugated for a singular masculine subject in the past tense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Tua sorella" (your sister) agrees with the verb "guarda" (is looking) in both number and person. The sentence is a simple subject-verb-object structure, making it a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Tua sorella" (Your sister) agrees with the verb "guarda" (is watching) in singular form, and the object "il CD" (the CD) is in the correct form. The sentence structure and word choices are appropriate.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia ha tagliato la testa al bisonte" is grammatically correct. It follows the correct Italian sentence structure and uses appropriate verb conjugation and noun forms. The subject, Sofia, is in the singular form and agrees with the verb "ha tagliato" in the third person singular form. The object, "la testa al bisonte," is also in the correct form. Overall, the sentence is syntactically and semantically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia ha tagliato le teste ai tori." is grammatically correct. It's a simple sentence in Italian, where "Sofia" is the subject, "ha tagliato" is the conjugated form of the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have) and the main verb "tagliare" (to cut) in the past tense, "le teste" is the direct object, and "ai tori" is the indirect object. The sentence structure and grammar are consistent and follow the rules of Italian language.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb 'taglierebbero' agrees with the plural subject 'I ragazzi' (the boys) in number and tense, and the sentence structure is correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a complete sentence with a subject (il toro), verb (è) and object (Maria ha preso per le corna). The sentence also makes logical sense, indicating that Maria grabbed the bull by the horns, not the buffalo.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Maria' is a singular subject, and 'stende' is the verb in third person singular conjugated for the present tense. The phrase 'il bucato' is a direct object in the sentence, which is also grammatically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because 'abbaia' is the third person singular form of the verb 'abbaiare' (to bark), but the subject 'Il mio amico' (my friend) is singular and masculine, so the correct verb form should be 'abbaia' instead of 'abbaia'. The correct sentence would be 'Il mio amico abbaia'.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ulula" is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence in Italian, where "Riccardo" is the subject and "ulula" is the verb, meaning "Riccardo howls." The sentence follows the correct subject-verb agreement and has no morphological, syntactical, or semantic issues.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele dormì" is grammatically correct. It is a simple past tense sentence in Italian, where "Gabriele" is the subject and "dormì" is the verb in its third person singular form, meaning "slept." The sentence structure follows the correct Italian syntax, and the verb agrees with the subject in number and person.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that the dog stopped very quickly ("si è fermato in un batter d'occhio"). The verb "è fermato" agrees with the singular subject "il cane" and the idiomatic expression "in un batter d'occhio" is correctly used.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. It follows proper Italian syntax, morphology, and semantics. The subject (Edoardo) and the verb (ci ha messo) agree in number and person, and the sentence expresses a clear and coherent idea.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo ha sezionato il vecchio tiglio." is grammatically correct. The subject "Leonardo" is in the third person singular form, and the verb "ha sezionato" agrees with the subject in number and person. The object "il vecchio tiglio" is in the singular form, which is appropriate for the singular subject. Overall, the sentence is syntactically and morphologically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that the six bombs exploded on May 6, 1999. The sentence structure and word choice are appropriate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject 'Lorenzo' is singular, and the verb 'ha' agrees with it in number. The negation 'non' is correctly placed before the verb 'ha'. The adverb 'più' is correctly placed after the verb 'ha'. The preposition 'di' is correctly used before the infinitive verb 'fumare'. The sentence structure is appropriate, and the word order is correct.
0	Morphology	The sentence is incorrect because the masculine form of the past participle 'diventato' should match the gender of the subject 'Andrea'. In this case, the feminine form 'diventata' should be used instead. The correct sentence would be 'Andrea è diventata in gamba.'
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso ha fatto gli auguri a Giulia." is grammatically correct. The subject, "Tommaso," is singular, and the verb, "ha fatto," agrees with it in number. The prepositional phrase "a Giulia" is correctly placed after the verb, indicating the recipient of the wishes.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject is Sofia, the verb is 'chiede' (asks), and the subordinate clause contains the verb 'torni' (you return) in the subjunctive mood, which is appropriate for the context of a request.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "vada" is in the singular form, while the subject "tu" is singular. However, the sentence is about someone else (Beatrice) being displeased, so the verb should agree with the implied subject "Beatrice" in the third person singular form. Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Che tu vada via dispiace a Beatrice" or, considering the implied subject, "Che tu vada via, Beatrice ne è dispiaciuta."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "I bambini" (The children) is plural, and the verb "hanno calpestato" (have trampled) agrees with the plural subject. The sentence is well-structured and makes sense in terms of meaning.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because "eruttarono lava" means "erupted lava," which is not possible for children. Children cannot erupt lava; only volcanoes can. A more accurate sentence would be "I bambini giocavano con i giocattoli" (The children were playing with toys).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The structure, verb tense, and punctuation are all appropriate for the intended meaning. The sentence states that "That man photographed the only witness, and it happened a month ago."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a direct object. In Italian, the verb 'fotografare' (to photograph) requires a direct object to indicate what or whom is being photographed. A correct version of the sentence would be: "Quell'uomo ne ha fotografato uno." (That man photographed one [of them]).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence in Italian, where "Andrea" is the subject, "ha carezzato" is the verb "has caressed" conjugated for the third person singular, and "il volto a Beatrice" is the direct object "Beatrice's face." The sentence structure and word choice are appropriate for the intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "è carezzato" agrees with the singular subject "Il volto di Paola" in number and gender. The verb form "è carezzato" is the third person singular form of the past participle of "carezzare" (to caress), which matches the singular masculine noun "volto" (face).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and semantically acceptable. It states that Edoardo broke Maria's arm. The sentence follows the correct Italian syntax and has proper morphology (the verb 'ha fratturato' agrees with the subject 'Edoardo' and the preposition 'di' is used correctly with 'braccio').
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. The subject Leonardo is singular, and the verb "ha paralizzato" (has paralyzed) agrees with it. The object Maria is also singular, and the preposition "a" is used correctly to indicate the indirect object.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "pesava" (weighed) is in the singular form, but the subject "il bambino" (the child) is singular. It should be "pesava" instead of "pesava" to agree with the singular subject. Correct sentence: "Il bambino pesava nove chili a pochi mesi." In the corrected sentence, the verb "pesava" (weighed) agrees in number (singular) with the subject "il bambino" (the child).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Gli operai' is the plural subject, and 'asfaltarono' is the third person plural past tense of 'asfaltare', which agrees with the plural subject. The sentence is a simple past tense sentence stating that the workers paved the road, and it is grammatically correct in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola elencò l'invitato" means "Paola listed the guest" in English. The verb "elencò" agrees with the singular subject "Paola" and the definite article "l'" is used correctly before the singular noun "invitato".
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the conjunction 'e' is used between two different clauses, which makes the sentence structure confusing. It would be better to use a comma to separate the two clauses or rephrase the sentence for clarity. Correct sentence: 'Alice ha messo i vestiti nell'armadio e ciò è accaduto.'
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. The subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "ha tolto" in the past tense, and the sentence structure is coherent. The use of "ciò" refers back to the action of removing clothes, and "nell'armadio" correctly indicates the location where the action occurred.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice riempie il frigo con frutta" is grammatically correct. The subject "Beatrice" is singular, and the verb "riempie" agrees with the subject in number. The prepositional phrase "con frutta" correctly modifies the verb "riempie". The sentence is clear, unambiguous, and follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple Italian sentence with a clear subject, verb, and object. Maria is the subject, difende (defends) is the verb, and Andrea dai pericoli (Andrea from dangers) is the object. The sentence structure is appropriate and makes sense in the context.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it is not clear which Maria is giving the book to the other. The sentence could be improved by specifying which Maria is the giver and which one is the receiver. For example, "Il libro passa da Maria (di cui) a Maria (di lei)." This clarifies that the book passes from one Maria to another. Without context, it is difficult to determine the intended meaning of the original sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple Italian sentence with the subject "Maria", the verb "dà" (present tense of "dare" - to give), the object "un libro", and the indirect object "a Paola". The sentence structure is correct, and all the words are in their correct form according to Italian grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is 'Francesco' (singular), and he is delegating 'Gabriele suo rappresentante' (his representative). The verb 'delega' agrees with the singular subject Francesco, and the sentence is structured correctly in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Sofia' and 'Maria' are both proper nouns (names), and 'delega' is the verb in the third person singular. The sentence translates to "Sofia appoints Maria as her representative," which is a coherent and grammatically sound statement.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it combines two independent clauses without a coordinating conjunction or appropriate punctuation. A coordinating conjunction like 'e' (and) or a semicolon should be used to connect the two clauses properly. The correct sentence would be: "Lorenzo abita e ciò succede a Roma" or "Lorenzo abita; ciò succede a Roma."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject is "Riccardo" and the verb "ha mangiato" is conjugated correctly in the third person singular. The sentence also has a clear subject-verb agreement. The second part of the sentence, "ciò è successo al ristorante," is also grammatically correct, with the demonstrative pronoun "ciò" agreeing with the neuter gender and the verb "è successo" in the third person singular.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the present tense, third person singular, and the subject 'Sofia' agrees with the verb 'fuma' in terms of person and number. The object 'una bionda' is also correctly used in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Edoardo is the subject, and the verb "ha spalmato" agrees with it in number and person. The object "il paté" and the prepositional phrase "sul pane" are also correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject is Andrea, and the verb 'ha spalmato' agrees with the subject in number and person. The object 'il pane di paté' is correctly placed after the verb. There are no morphological, syntactic, or semantic errors in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Le bombe piovono su di noi" instead of "piovevano." The verb "piovono" is the correct form to use in the present tense, while "piovevano" is the imperfect tense, which doesn't fit the context of the sentence.
0	Morphology	The sentence is incorrect because 'misti' should be 'miste' to agree in gender with 'matrimoni'. The correct sentence would be 'I matrimoni miste funzionano in modo perfetto'.
1	Correct	The sentence "La tua idea equivale alla mia" is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence in Italian, translating to "Your idea is equivalent to mine" in English. The subject "tua idea" (your idea) is followed by the verb "equivale" (is equivalent), and the object "mia" (mine). All words are correctly inflected and placed in the sentence according to Italian grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "La tua idea e la mia si equivalgono" is grammatically correct. The conjunction "e" (and) connects the two noun phrases "la tua idea" (your idea) and "la mia" (my), and the reflexive pronoun "si" is used to indicate that the ideas are equivalent to each other. The sentence structure and agreement between words are correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo gira per la città" is grammatically correct. It follows the Italian sentence structure, where the subject (Edoardo) comes first, followed by the verb (gira), and then the prepositional phrase (per la città).

0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'bada' should agree with the subject 'Alice e Maria' in the plural form. The correct verb form would be 'badano'. The sentence should be 'Alice e Maria badano Maria'.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense. It says that Leonardo is making a note in his notebook that the president will write his autobiography. The sentence structure and word choice are appropriate for the context.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'partire' is in its infinitive form ('parta') instead of its conjugated form for the second person singular ('parti'). The correct sentence would be: 'Alessandro invita Paola a che si parta.' or 'Alessandro invita Paola a che si parta.'
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Alice" is singular and the verb "ha accompagnato" agrees with it in number and person. The sentence structure is also correct, with the subject, verb, and object (Tommaso and al cinema) following the correct order in Italian.

The sentence structure is coherent and follows Italian grammar rules.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject. In Italian, a sentence typically requires a subject, even if it's implied. A correct version of the sentence could be "Io mi girano le scatole" (which means "I'm annoyed") or "Mi girano le scatole" with the subject understood as "Io" (I).

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that Sofia and Riccardo speak the same language. The subject (Sofia and Riccardo) is correctly matched with the verb (parlano) in the plural form, and the sentence structure is coherent.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because "avere fegato" is an idiomatic expression in Italian that means "to have guts" or "to be brave." The English translation "to have liver" is not the intended meaning of the idiom. The sentence is semantically incorrect when translated literally to English.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing a subject. A proper subject should be included before the verb "avere" to make the sentence grammatically correct. For example, "Lei ha le paturnie" (She has the doubts) or "Loro hanno le paturnie" (They have the doubts).
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing a subject and an object. A more complete and grammatically correct sentence would be "Ho delle scatole" (I have some boxes), where "Ho" is the conjugated form of "avere" (to have) and "delle scatole" is the object. The phrase "avere sulle scatole" is not a complete sentence and does not convey a clear meaning.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it does not make logical sense in English. The phrase "in un ventre di vacca" translates to "in a cow's belly" which is an unusual and unclear metaphor in English. It might be a correct Italian sentence, but it is not appropriate for English grammar and comprehension.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "la ragazza" (the girl) agrees with the verb "mangerà" (will eat) in number and person. The sentence also has a direct object "la pizza" (the pizza).
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'ha presentato' should agree with the subject 'lei', which is a singular feminine subject, but the verb 'ha presentato' is a third person singular masculine verb. The correct form should be 'Lei ha presentato la donna a dei suoi amici.'
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Edoardo' is the subject and 'obbedisce' is the verb conjugated in the third person singular, agreeing with the subject. 'a Sofia' is the indirect object indicating to whom Edoardo is obeying. The sentence structure and agreement between subject and verb are correct.

In this sentence, "Edoardo" is the subject, "ci" is an indirect object pronoun (meaning "to us" or "for us"), and "va" is the third person singular form of the verb "andare" (to go). The sentence structure and verb conjugation are accurate, making the sentence grammatically acceptable.

The direct object is "cena" (dinner).
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a verb conjugated in the third person singular form. It should be "Beatrice le scappa di comprare" or "Beatrice scappa a comprare" to make it grammatically correct.

The prepositional phrase di Gabriele (of Gabriele) provides additional information about the object of the sentence.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Era" is the third person singular of the verb "essere" (to be) in the imperfect tense, and it agrees with the subject "lui" (he). "Contento" is an adjective that agrees with the subject in gender (masculine) and number (singular). "Di giocare a carte" is a prepositional phrase that correctly modifies the adjective "contento." Overall, the sentence structure and agreement are correct.

0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject. In Italian, the verb "vediamo" (we see) requires a subject. The corrected sentence should be: "Noi vediamo di tutti i tipi" (We see all kinds).
1	Correct	The sentence "Ha abboccato all'amo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He/She bit the hook" in English. The verb "abboccato" agrees with the subject "Ha" in gender and number, and the preposition "all'amo" is correctly used.
0	Morphology	The sentence is incorrect because 'Ho riso' is not grammatically correct. It should be 'Ho riso' if you mean "I laughed for two hours" (singular subject), but the correct form for "I laughed for two hours" should be 'Ho riso per due ore'. If you meant to say "They laughed for two hours" (plural subject), it should be 'Hanno riso per due ore'. The issue is with the verb conjugation, which needs to agree with the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Ha" (he/she has) agrees with the singular direct object "una cotta" (a crush), and the preposition "per" (for) is followed by the indirect object "Sofia." The sentence structure and grammar are accurate.

The verb "costruito" agrees with the past participle of "costruire" and matches the subject's gender and number. The phrase "castelli in aria" is a coherent idiomatic expression.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it is in Italian and should be "Questo terreno frutta molti soldi" (This land yields much money) to be grammatically correct. The incorrect use of "quel" instead of "questo" as the subject of the sentence is a syntax error.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that Gabriele made Riccardo write a letter to Lorenzo. The structure of the sentence is clear and follows the rules of Italian grammar.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the subject 'il vento' (the wind) does not agree with the verb 'ha fatto rompere' (made break). The correct form would be 'Il vento ha fatto rompere il vetro.' (The wind made the glass break.) Additionally, 'da Andrea' (by Andrea) is not necessary in this sentence, as it does not provide any clear information about who is responsible for the action. A corrected version could be 'Il vetro è stato rotto dal vento.' (The glass was broken by the wind.)
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'ha fatto' (has made) should agree with the subject 'il colonello' (the colonel) in both gender and number.

The corrected sentence would be: "Il colonello ha fatto la nave." - "Il colonnello l'ha fatta" (The colonel has made the ship).

Therefore, the sentence is correct in terms of morphology, syntax, and semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and the subject "Il sasso" (the stone) is singular and agrees with the verb "ha rotto" (has broken) in the past tense. The object "il vetro" (the glass) is also singular.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "schiacciare" (to press) does not fit the context of "acceleratore" (accelerator). A more appropriate verb would be "pigiare" (to step on), so the sentence should be "L'auto ha pigiato l'acceleratore."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject. In Italian, sentences typically require a subject, even if it's implied. A correct version of the sentence would be "Il colpo ha schiacciato l'acceleratore (di lei)." Here, the implied subject "he" or "she" is made explicit with "(di lei)".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Lorenzo is the subject, and "ha rotto" is the auxiliary verb "avere" in the third person singular form, agreeing with the subject. "Il fidanzamento" is the direct object, which is singular and agrees with the verb "ha rotto."

The verb conjugation "è lavata" (has washed) is also correct for the third person singular.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with the subject "Paola" and the verb "ha trascurato" in the past tense, followed by the reflexive pronoun "se stessa" (herself). The sentence structure and word choice are appropriate for the context.

1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea ha graffiato lo sportello dell'auto" is grammatically correct. The verb "ha graffiato" agrees with the singular subject "Andrea" in number and tense. The prepositional phrase "dell'auto" modifies "sportello" correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "lo sportello dell'auto" is singular, and the verb "si è graffiato" agrees with it in number and person. The sentence is a simple statement describing an action (graffiato) being performed by the subject (lo sportello dell'auto).

0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because the subject 'i prati' (the fields) is plural, but the verb 'si sono rivestiti' (have been covered) is in the reflexive form and should agree with the subject in number. The correct verb form would be 'si sono rivestiti' or 'si sono rivestite' if the fields were feminine. If the subject were singular, the verb would be 'si è rivestito' or 'si è rivestita' for a feminine subject. The sentence should read: 'I prati si sono rivestiti con i fiori' or 'I prati si sono rivestite con i fiori' if the fields were feminine.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It says, "The prices have increased by 10%." The verb "sono aumentati" agrees with the plural subject "i prezzi" and the percentage expression "del 10%" is correctly placed after the verb.

The subject "Il contagio" (The contagion) agrees with the singular verb "è" (is) and the prepositional phrase "in diffusione" (in spreading) is correctly placed in the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Il gatto ha impiastricciato di peli il divano" instead of "Il gatto ha impelato di peli il divano." The verb "impiastricciare" means "to smear or spread" and is used to describe the action of the cat spreading its fur on the couch. The verb "impelare" is not the correct verb to use in this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the passive voice, where "gli alberi" (the trees) are the subject and "le foglie" (the leaves) are the object.

0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it states that the "vittorie" (victories) have fueled the "calciatore" (football player) in a week. This is semantically incorrect since victories cannot physically fuel a person. A more accurate sentence could be: "Le vittorie hanno motivato il calciatore in una settimana." (The victories have motivated the football player in a week.)

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "il treno" (the train) agrees with the verb "ha ritardato" (has been delayed) in both gender and number. The time expression "per due ore" (for two hours) is also correctly placed and structured. The sentence is a clear and correct statement about the train being delayed for two hours.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Il vino è diventato aceto dopo ore" or "Il vino è diventato aceto in ore". The original sentence is incorrect because "per ore" means "for hours" and it should be replaced with "dopo ore" (after hours) or "in ore" (in hours). The time expression "per ore" does not correctly convey the duration of the transformation.

The predicate "saporita" (tasty) agrees with the subject in gender (feminine) and number (singular). The sentence structure is also correct with the subject, verb, and predicate in the correct order.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it translates to "The wine is vinegar," which is a nonsensical statement.

A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "Il vino è diventato aceto" (The wine has become vinegar).

0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "calmare" should agree with the plural subject "Andrea e quell'uomo." The correct form of the verb should be "hanno calmato" instead of "ha fatto calmare." The corrected sentence would be: "Alice ha fatto calmare Andrea e quell'uomo."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because 'fatto preoccupare' is not used correctly in this context. The correct verb form should be 'preoccupare' to indicate that Maria caused Gabriele to be worried. So the correct sentence would be: 'Maria ha preoccupato Gabriele dalla fidanzata.'
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because 'irretire' is not a correct Italian verb. The correct verb to use in this context is 'ingannare' (to deceive). The correct sentence would be 'Maria ha ingannato Leonardo.'
0	Morphology	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "sedurre" requires the reflexive pronoun "si" to be conjugated correctly in the third person singular. The correct form should be "Riccardo si seduce" instead of "Riccardo si seduce."
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "piacere" (to like) is used in the reflexive form "piacersi" when expressing the idea that someone likes something or someone likes them. In this case, the subject "Lorenzo" is singular, so the correct reflexive verb form should be "si è piaciuto" instead of "si è piaciuto per ciò." The latter seems to be an attempt to translate "Lorenzo liked it for that," which doesn't make sense in Italian without further context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct.

1	Correct	The sentence "Emma si sente nervosa" is grammatically correct. The verb "sentire" is conjugated correctly in the third person singular form "si sente" to agree with the subject "Emma". The adjective "nervosa" also agrees with the feminine singular subject.

Overall, the sentence is grammatically correct and makes sense in context.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because the Italian phrase "i nervi a fior di pelle" is translated literally as "the nerves at the tips of the skin." However, this phrase is not commonly used in English. A more accurate translation would be "Sofia's nerves are on edge" or "Sofia is on edge." The error is due to a semantic difference between the two languages.
1	Correct	The sentence "Emma è in stupore" is grammatically correct. It follows the subject-verb agreement in Italian. The subject "Emma" is singular, and the verb "è" (is) agrees with it. The prepositional phrase "in stupore" (in astonishment) is correctly placed after the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject 'Paola' is singular and agrees with the verb 'è' (is) in the third person singular form. The preposition 'in' followed by 'uno stato' (a state) is also correct to indicate the state of fear that Paola is in.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the subject is plural ("quelle parole"), so the verb should agree in number and be plural. The correct form would be "hanno offeso" instead of "ha offeso". The corrected sentence would be: "Quelle parole hanno offeso Francesco."

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria fece una seduta di elioterapia" means "Maria had an electrotherapy session" in English.

0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the subject "il treno" is singular, but the verb "è stato perso" is in the past participle form, which requires a singular auxiliary verb "è stato" instead of the plural form "sono stati" that should be used with the plural subject "i treni". The correct sentence would be "Sono stati persi troppo volte i treni, in questa redazione."

The sentence structure and verb conjugation are appropriate for the subject, making the sentence correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'ne disse' should agree in number with the subject 'Lorenzo', which is singular. The correct form should be 'ne disse uno a Maria' or 'ne disse uno a Maria e un altro a Maria'. Additionally, the use of 'due' as the object of the verb 'dire' is not correct in this context. It should be replaced with 'uno' or 'un altro' to indicate that two things are given to Maria, one at a time.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is an idiomatic expression in Italian, "prendere fischi per fiaschi," which means "to misunderstand or misinterpret something."

0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the conjugation of the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have) is not consistent with the plural subject "Andrea e Giulia" (Andrea and Giulia). The correct sentence should be "Che Andrea e Giulia abbiano telefonato ha causato il fatto che Giulia sia ritornata." This change ensures that the auxiliary verb "abbiano" agrees with the plural subject "Andrea e Giulia."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo telefona ad Emma" is a complete and accurate sentence in Italian. It translates to "Riccardo calls Emma" in English. The subject is "Riccardo," the verb is "telefona," and the indirect object is "ad Emma." There are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors in the sentence.

Alessandro is the subject, 'girò' is the past tense of 'girare' (to turn, to go), 'con l'auto' (with the car) is a prepositional phrase, and 'a raccoglierla' (to pick her up) is an infinitive phrase acting as the direct object of the verb 'girò'. All the elements fit together well to form a complete and correct sentence.

1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele segue una rigida condotta morale" is grammatically correct. It follows Italian syntax rules and the sentence is semantically coherent. It translates to "Gabriele follows a strict moral conduct."
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it implies that a mosquito (zanzara) has a strict moral conduct, which is not a logical or sensible statement. Mosquitoes are insects and do not possess a moral code or conduct.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it implies that the refrigerator has a strong burn for Francesco, which does not make sense in the context of a refrigerator. The intended meaning is likely that Francesco is the one who has a strong burn, but the sentence structure does not convey this meaning properly.

The verb "ha" agrees with the subject "Beatrice" in person and number, and the prepositional phrase "di rapire Emma" correctly modifies the noun "l'incarico."
0	Morphology	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'corre' should be in the third person singular form 'corre' to match the singular subject 'Alessandro'. However, the sentence should read 'Alessandro corre l'asino' (Alessandro runs the donkey) since the noun 'asina' (donkey) is feminine, and the article 'l'' should be 'la' to agree with the gender and number of the noun. Additionally, the correct sentence should use the verb 'corre' in its third person singular form, as mentioned earlier.

0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because it is semantically illogical. A refrigerator (il frigo) cannot seduce a cat (un gatto) as refrigerators are not living beings capable of seduction.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Alice (a singular subject) has the action of "curvato" (curved) in the past tense, and "la fronte" (the forehead) is the object of the sentence. The sentence structure and verb conjugation are accurate.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because "ha curvato" (has bent) is not a proper verb to use with "la faccia" (the face). It should be "ha piegato" (has folded) or "ha stravolto" (has changed drastically) to describe the action of bending or changing the face. The verb "curvare" (to bend) is used with objects or parts of the body that can bend, like a road or a leg, but not the face.
0	Morphology	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'mantiene' should be in the third person singular form 'mantiene' instead of the third person plural form 'mantengono' to agree with the singular subject 'Sofia'. A correct sentence would be: 'Sofia mantiene testa al nemico'.

0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because "a" should be "a" instead of "fa". In Italian, the correct conjugation of the verb "fare" in the third person singular should be "fa" for the present tense, not "fa a". The correct sentence should be "Riccardo fa un cattivo gioco."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea ha rotto il collo a Beatrice" translates to "Andrea broke Beatrice's neck."

0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing a subject. In Italian, a sentence typically requires a subject, verb, and object. The phrase "Essere all'indice" is a verb ("to be") and a prepositional phrase ("at the index"), but it lacks a clear subject. Adding a subject, such as "Il libro" (The book) would make the sentence grammatically correct. Corrected sentence: Il libro è all'indice. (The book is at the index.)
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'mettere' requires an object to indicate the action performed. In this case, the verb is used without an object, making the sentence incomplete and ungrammatical. A corrected version could be: "Mettere qualcosa all'indice" (Put something at the index).
1	Correct	The sentence "Alzare il gomito" is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alzare" means "to raise" and "il gomito" means "the elbow". The sentence structure is correct, and the verb agrees with the singular subject "il gomito". Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.

It consists of the verb "perdere" (to lose), "il lume" (the light), "della ragione" (of reason), which together form a complete expression. There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence is incorrect because "cavare la castagna dal fuoco a qualcuno" is an idiomatic expression in Italian that means "to do something dangerous or risky to help someone". However, the English translation provided, "to take someone out of the fire," does not convey the same meaning. The correct translation would be "to rescue someone from a difficult situation" or "to save someone from a predicament." The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian, but the meaning is not accurately conveyed in English.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a verb. The verb "essere" (to be) is missing, and it should be "Essere povero in canna" to be grammatically correct.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable.

The sentence expresses a clear and coherent idea, which is that every child has a guardian angel that protects them.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'è' does not agree in number with the plural subject 'quella festa'. It should be 'sono' instead of 'è'. The corrected sentence would be: 'A quelle feste è di rigore lo smoking.'
0	Morphology	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "nuota" (swims) should be in the third person singular form "nuota" instead of the infinitive form. The correct sentence would be: "La moto di Leonardo è nuova di zecca." which means "Leonardo's motorcycle is brand new."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject ("un'unità") and a verb ("ho visto") in the past tense. The prepositional phrase "in marcia" describes the state of the unit. Overall, the sentence structure and grammar are correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a verb. A proper Italian sentence requires a verb, and in this case, it's missing. The correct sentence would be "Mi piace che Leonardo ritorni" (I like that Leonardo comes back) or "A Maria piace che Leonardo ritorni" (Maria likes that Leonardo comes back).
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia corre a mangiare" is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence in Italian, where "Sofia" is the subject, "corre" is the verb in the third person singular form (indicating that Sofia is running), and "a mangiare" is an infinitive phrase that means "to eat." The sentence structure is correct, and the verb agrees with the subject.

1	Correct	The sentence "Mille stelle brillano nel cielo" is grammatically correct. The sentence is in Italian and it means "A thousand stars shine in the sky." The subject "stelle" (stars) agrees in number with the verb "brillano" (shine), and the prepositional phrase "nel cielo" (in the sky) correctly describes where the shining is happening.
0	Syntax	The sentence is incorrect because "ciò" (meaning "that" or "this") should be followed by a verb, not "guarda" (meaning "looks"). A correct version would be "Ciò guarda questa cosa" (meaning "That looks at this thing"). However, since the sentence provided is not grammatically correct, the label is 0.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Leonardo" is singular and the verb "studia" agrees with it in number and person. The adverb "intensamente" modifies the verb "studia" and the duration expression "tre ore al giorno" correctly follows the verb.
