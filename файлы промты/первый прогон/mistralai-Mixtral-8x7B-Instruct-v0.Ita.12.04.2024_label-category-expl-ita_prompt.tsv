label	category	explanation
0	Morphology	The verb "to want" should be conjugated as "I want" instead of "want." Additionally, the preposition "of" is unnecessary before the name "Giulia," so the correct formulation would be "Voglio salutare Giulia."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It expresses the speaker's desire to greet someone named Sofia. No errors were found in morphology, syntax or semantics.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the determiner "il" does not agree with the noun phrase "la Divina Commedia". In English, this would be similar to saying "I like the the Divine Comedy." Instead, use just one determiner, either "my favorite is Divina Commedia" or "Il mio preferito è la Divina Commedia", depending on whether you want to say that it is your favorite or specifically mentioning that it is one of many favorites you have.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because "Il mio treno preferito" means "my favorite train", and it does not make sense to call a book like "Divina Commedia" a train.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense for each action verb. The sequence of events is also clear with the use of "said" as an indirect speech marker.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "está" should agree with its subject "Andrea", which is singular and third person. Therefore, it should be "Andrea está" instead of "Andrea estan".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and the verb "ha incontrato" agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence "il padre" is singular and agrees with the verb "è ricomparso", which is also singular. Additionally, the definite article "il" correctly matches the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the noun it precedes.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the third person singular verb "are" agrees with its subject "prices," which is also plural. Additionally, the word order and tense are appropriate for the intended meaning of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Salvato" agrees with the singular subject "Andrea," and "ci siamo dati" is a reflexive verb that matches the plural subject pronoun "we."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and the verb "is" agrees with its singular subject "the palace of insurance".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The word "that" functions as a demonstrative adjective modifying the noun "construction", and the verb phrase "offends the good taste" correctly expresses that this construction violates accepted standards of aesthetics or propriety.
1	Correct	The sentence "Newton has explained the force of gravity" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English verb agreement and word order rules. "Newton," as a singular subject, correctly uses the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "has explained." Additionally, the objects of the sentence, "the force" and "gravity," follow appropriately after the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "have been given" agrees with the subject "I".
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso si è danneggiato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian reflexive verb tense. In this case, "si è danneggiato" is a third-person singular reflexive verb that agrees with the subject "Tommaso".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "those men" agrees with the verb "have denounced." Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "themselves" correctly refers to the subject of the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "compro" does not agree with its subject "Io". In this case, "compro" should be changed to "compro" for grammatical agreement between the subject and the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a simple subject ("I") and a compound predicate ("have met Lorenzo" and "did not meet Emma"). Both clauses are in the past tense, making the sentence coherent. Additionally, the use of a comma after "Lorenzo" correctly separates the two independent clauses.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "have" agrees with its subject "I", and "met" which is the past tense of meet shows that the action was completed in the past. Also, "many friends of Riccardo" is correctly used as the object of the preposition "of".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactic or semantic errors. It follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object and all words have been used appropriately according to their meaning and function in this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Don't" is the contraction of "do not," which agrees with the subject "I." Additionally, "find" is a verb that can be followed by an infinitive without "to" when expressing possibility or ability. In this case, it shows the speaker's ability to find many apples if they look for them.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "Riccardo" is the subject, "has promised" is the verb tense that matches with singular third person subjects, "to Maria" is the indirect object showing to whom or for whom something was done, "will put" is the future action related to the promise made by Riccardo, "in sale" is an adverbial phrase describing where the selling will take place, and "his own house" is the direct object of the sentence indicating what is being sold.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "ha salutato", and the object of the sentence "i suoi genitori" also agrees with the verb in number.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo not is very smart" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. The subject of the sentence, "Riccardo," is singular and the verb "is" agrees with it. Additionally, the adjective "very" modifies the adverb "smart", which is placed after the linking verb "is".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Although the subject "Riccardo" is followed by a comma and the adverb clause "credo," this structure is acceptable as long as it doesn't create confusion or ambiguity. In this case, there are no issues with comprehension, so the sentence is considered to be grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error. Here, "Hanno" which means "they" in English agrees with the plural subject "molte persone", and it also correctly matches with the verb "chiamato". Hence, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a question in English and has an explicit subject ("Riccardo") and a verb ("ha comprato"). Additionally, the form "che" functions as an interrogative pronoun that replaces the direct object, making the sentence complete and coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and all of the elements "Andrea," "was," and "incontrato" agree in number.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and it is in the third person singular form, agreeing with the verb "ha domandato". * "Ha domandato" is the conjugated form of the verb "domandare" for third person singular subjects in the past tense. * "Da chi" is a relative pronoun introducing the clause that modifies "Leonardo". * "Non era stato visto" is the passive voice of the verb "vedere", indicating that someone or something has not been seen by Leonardo.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in morphology, syntax or semantics. The subject of the sentence "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "has been told", and the verb tense indicates future action for the third person singular ("will speak"). Therefore, there are no issues with agreement or tense consistency.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a verb. It should be "Gabriele, when did you see him?" or if the subject of discussion is known to be male then "Gabriele, when did you see him last?" would also work.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for expressing questions about location using an auxiliary verb "has" and the preposition "in". Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is maintained as the singular noun "Leonardo" matches with the third person singular form of the verb "has".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the question form should end with a question mark instead of a period. Additionally, there seems to be a missing subject or auxiliary verb for the clause "have spoken." A possible correction could be: "Which politician(s) spoke?"
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically incorrect but it is semantically confusing and lacks clear meaning due to the multiple layers of indirect speech. It would be more clear if specific details about what the politician said on the radio and what the judge declared were provided.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Lorenzo" is the subject of the sentence and it is in its singular form. * "ha detto" is the auxiliary verb used to indicate that someone said something in the past. It agrees with the subject in number and person. * "che" introduces a subordinate clause. * "partirà" is the main verb of the subordinate clause, indicating future action. It also agrees with the subject in number and person. * "domani" indicates when the action will take place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb agreement rule and uses the past tense properly to indicate that the action of having dinner happened after Francesco arrived.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for word order and agreement between subject and verb. Additionally, all words are used appropriately according to their meanings.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper verb agreement between the subject "chi" and the verb "tocca." Additionally, the idiomatic expression "to touch wires, one dies" exists in Italian language with similar meaning as in English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject of the sentence "Alessandro" has an action expressed by the verb phrase "has told". The clause "che è venuto a trovarmi ieri" provides additional information about the subject and can be removed without changing the meaning of the main clause. Therefore, it is a subordinate clause that modifies the subject. Overall, this sentence follows standard English language conventions for word order, tense agreement, and punctuation.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la commissione" matches with the verb "ritiene", and the subordinate clause correctly uses the past participle "aver fornito". Also, the adjective "sufficienti" agrees with its noun "prove". Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il timore della guerra è ingiustificato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "il timore" which means "the fear", acts as a singular noun that takes a singular verb form "è," which means "is." Similarly, "della guerra" which means "of war" correctly modifies the noun phrase by indicating what kind of fear is being discussed. Overall, there are no semantic or syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo has lost the keys" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense for the third person singular subject "Riccardo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb form "è" and the adjective "bramoso" also agrees with the gender and number of the noun it modifies.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for an interrogative sentence with indirect speech in English. "Francesco" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "thinks". Additionally, the auxiliary verb "does" has been used correctly to form the question, followed by the base form of the main verb "ask", and the preposition "to" introduces the indirect object "Lorenzo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the given sentence. "Tommaso" is the subject of the main clause and is followed by the verb "ha affermato". This forms the first simple tense of the verb "affermare", which means to state or claim something as true. Following this is the subordinate clause with the subject "Edoardo" and the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "parlare", namely "parla". Overall, the structure of the sentence is coherent and does not contain any mistakes.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("I"), an auxiliary verb ("have been"), and a predicate ("always supported a different position, so I will have to vote against this proposal"). There are no morphological or syntactical errors that would make the sentence unacceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Tommaso"), an action verb ("ha ordinato") and an indirect object ("Andrea") followed by another action verb ("di difendere"). The use of "ad" before the infinitive form "difendere" indicates that this is a command or request given by one person to another. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it requires the use of "has been" instead of "being" to agree with the past participle "discovered". Also, there should be no article before "delitto", since we are referring to a specific crime that was previously mentioned or known from context. A corrected version would read: "The fact that a crime had been discovered disturbed us."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is an interrogative sentence asking who Alex will meet.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all of the words are used appropriately.
0	Syntax	The phrase is not grammatically correct because the relative pronoun "that" or "who" is missing after "person". It should be: "This is the person who/that Eduardo made the statement that Tommaso spoke."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the relative pronoun "who" or "that" is required after the verb "believe". Also, it should be "Sofia whom he believes has kissed", using the object form of the pronoun and adding an auxiliary verb for tense consistency with the past participle "baciado" (kissed).
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because the phrase "don't know how we could solve" does not make sense in the given context. It requires an additional subject or object to complete its meaning properly. A possible correction would be adding a specific problem as an object of this sentence, such as "What programming problems don't you know how we could resolve?"
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the past tense verb "have" should be used as "has" to agree with the third person singular pronoun "he".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is an ellipsis that needs to be completed with the verb "them". So the sentence should be "Abbiamo visti loro" or "We saw them", if we are referring to specific people.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for simple sentences in English. "Sofia" is the subject, "dice" is the verb that agrees with the singular third person subject, and the adverbial clause "that Alexander will speak tomorrow" provides additional information about when the action takes place.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the reflexive pronoun "se stessa" refers to the subject of the sentence "Beatrice", but it is placed between the auxiliary verb "ha" and the past participle "avuto". In Italian, the correct position for the reflexive pronoun is immediately before the verb it refers to. Therefore, the corrected sentence should be: "Beatrice ha dichiarato di non avermi ha nothing a che fare con Gabriele." However, this correction introduces another error since we cannot use two auxiliary verbs "ha" together. A better way to express the same idea would be: "Beatrice ha dichiarato di non avere nulla a che fare con Gabriele."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate tense for the action described. Also, the reflexive pronoun "si" is correctly used to indicate that Andrea performed an action on himself.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors. The subject of the sentence is "Il padre di Andrea" which is singular and agrees with the third person singular verb form "è". Furthermore, there is a subordinate clause "when I spoke to him", where "him" refers back to "the father of Andrea" making the sentence clear and easy to understand.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the structure of reported speech with multiple levels of embedding and uses verbs that agree in number with their subjects at each level. In this case, "Penso" agrees with the subject "I", "creda" agrees with the subject "Edoardo", "voglia" agrees with the subject "Maria", and "veda" agrees with thesubject "Gabriele". Additionally, all pronouns refer to previously mentioned entities without causing confusion or ambiguity.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject ("Edoardo") and the verbs ("crede", "voglia" and "veda") agree in number and tense. Additionally, each clause has a clear subject and verb, making the meaning understandable.
1	Correct	The sentence "The rabbit eats" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("the rabbit") and a verb ("eats"). There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a subject and the word "that" before the clause "the professor has recommended." A possible correction could be: "What book does he say that the professor has recommended reading?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Primo" can be used as an adverb meaning "before other people or things in time, importance, order, or degree," and it agrees with the verb "arrived." Also, the subject-auxiliary agreement is respected since there is only one person implied ("I"), so "sono" is correctly used instead of "siamo".
1	Correct	The sentence "Arrives an man" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for present tense third-person singular subjects, which requires adding an "-s" or "-es" to the base form of the verb. In this case, "arrives" is the correct form of the verb to use with a third-person singular subject like "an man". However, I would suggest revising the sentence to say "A man arrives," as this is more commonly used and sounds more natural in English.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo killed Andrea" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of the words are used appropriately.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "Andrea" is the subject and "has said" is the verb phrase expressing that someone (in this case, Andrea) made an utterance or statement about something. Additionally, the pronoun "lo" refers to "Tommaso," indicating that Tommaso is doing the action of looking at someone or something. Therefore, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "Gabriele" as the singular subject matches with the verb "ha". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "di andare al mare" provides more context about what kind of desire or urge Gabriele has, making the overall structure complete and coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "Questo" agrees with the singular noun "libro". - The verb "avevo" matches the past tense and the subject "I", which is implied but not explicitly stated in this sentence. - The clause "that I had never read" correctly follows "this book" to provide additional information about it.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in morphology, syntax or semantics. The subject of the sentence "Da quel professore" is in singular form and agrees with the verb "è stato". The question tag at the end of the sentence is also correctly formed using the auxiliary verb "è" that corresponds to the main verb of the sentence "è stato".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" is singular and agrees with the verb "crede", which is also in the third person singular form. Additionally, the future tense of the verb "invaderemo" correctly corresponds to the idea that this action will happen in the future.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks the auxiliary verb "will" or "do" to form a question correctly. It should be "A proposito di quei paesi, quali cred**e che** ANDREA invaderanno?" Additionally, there is a typo where "paesi" is misspelled as "quesi". Also, for capitalization rules, only proper nouns such as names of people and countries should start with an uppercase letter. So, "Andrea" should have the first letter capitalized but "quei paesi" should remain lowercased unless referring specifically to certain countries already mentioned beforehand.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It describes that last year Alexander was writing a book but he hasn't finished it yet. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "L'anno scorso" indicates the past tense and "ma a tutt'oggi" introduces a contrasting present situation. This creates a coherent temporal frame for the two actions described by the verbs "scrisse" and "non ha ancora finito".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it contains a contradiction. A person cannot be both single and married at the same time.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the current king of France" is singular and agrees with the verb "is". Additionally, the predicate adjective "calvo" correctly describes the noun it modifies.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the conditional structure "if ... then" and negates both parts of it with "not". This creates a logical equivalence between the two statements, meaning that if at least one student didn't pass the exam, then every student didn't pass it. While this may seem counterintuitive or even false depending on the context, the sentence itself is syntactically valid.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax or semantics. "Ieri" is an adverb modifying the verb "promisi", which agrees with its subject "ho". "Di partire" is an infinitive phrase that acts as the direct object of the verb "promisi". Overall, this sentence has a clear meaning and follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la corte" agrees with the verb "dichiarò" in number and tense, and the object "l'imputato" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, the adjective "innocente" modifies the noun "imputato" appropriately.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the past tense of "eat" should be "ate", not "eated". Additionally, there is a missing hyphen in the compound adjective "two-hour". It should be "two-hour delay."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for possessive nouns and verb agreement. "I" is the subject of the sentence, taking the action indicated by the past tense verb "have taken." This implies that at some point in the past, the speaker took possession of an object referred to as "the keys," which is the direct object of the sentence. There are no morphological or semantic errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The sentence follows the standard English language structure and conveys a clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the adjective "bella" agrees with the singular noun "casa," and the verb "fa" agrees with the subject "una bella casa." Additionally, the word order is correct, making the meaning clear and coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" matches with the verb "use," which is in the first-person singular form. Additionally, there are no obvious morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The word "calculator" is an agent performing the action of functioning well, and it agrees with the third-person singular present tense verb "works." This type of construction follows standard English subject-verb agreement rules for number and person.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Apologies for any confusion.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Le ragazze" agrees with the verb "sono arrivate" in number and tense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Il libro che mi ha prestato Lorenzo"), a verb ("mi piace") and an object ("non"). All words are used correctly according to their morphological form and there is no semantic inconsistency or ambiguity.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found.
0	Morphology	The adverb "velocemente" requires an adjective or another adverb to modify. In this case, there is no word being modified by "velocemente," so the sentence is not grammatically correct as it stands. It could be corrected with the addition of an appropriate word for "legge" ("reads") to modify, such as "libri" ("books"): "Legge libri velocemente."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found. "Andando" is the gerund form of the verb "andare", used here as an adverbial clause modifying how the action expressed by the main verb ("ho incontrato") was performed; "a casa" indicates where the speaker was going when they encountered someone who happens to be the listener's brother.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "I" and a verb "am going" which agrees with the subject. Then it has the infinitive phrase "to pick up the car". This structure follows English syntax rules and there are no semantic errors or morphological issues either.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. It also conveys a clear meaning that places don’t change their appearance as humans do. Additionally, there are no misspelled words or punctuation errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is an imperative sentence with the subject "you" implied and the verb "go" in its base form. The exclamation mark at the end indicates that it is a command or instruction to leave.
1	Correct	The sentence "Io sono affamato" is grammatically correct. Here, "Io" is the first-person singular subject pronoun and "sono" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere", which agrees with the subject in number and person. However, it is more common to say "Ho fame" in Italian when expressing that one is hungry.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the proper form of the verb "to be" for third person singular ("brave") to agree with the subject "this boy". Additionally, the exclamation mark at the end adds emphasis and shows excitement or admiration towards the action being described.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of an independent clause "Paola is a woman" and the adverbial subordinate clause "that we appreciate very much". Both clauses are correctly constructed and follow proper subject-verb agreement rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a question asking about the speaker's plans for tomorrow.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the basic structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) where "I" is the subject, "have seen" is the verb and "the book that you have given me" is the object.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is no subject in the sentence. It should be "Friends of Andrea are..." or "Andrea's friends are..." to complete the thought and provide a clear subject for the verb that follows.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "I believe" followed by "that" indicates reported speech or belief, which is why the verb after "you" changes to third person singular form "has."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The reflexive pronoun "si" refers to the subject of the previous clause, which is understood as "he" or "she." This type of construction is called a "compound predicate," where two actions are performed by the same subject and are connected with a conjunction like "and" or, as in this case, by using a reflexive pronoun instead.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense for each action described. "Volevano" correctly matches with multiple subjects "Masha and Jane," while "hanno distrutta" agrees with its singular feminine direct object "lei." Additionally, both verbs are consistently in the past tense to describe completed actions.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "Ogni persona prenda il suo cappotto" instead of "ognuno prenda." In English, the equivalent would be "Everyone take their coat," but this incorrectly implies that each person has multiple coats. Instead, we need to use "each person" as the subject and make sure the verb agrees with this singular subject, so "Each person takes his or her coat" would be grammatically correct. Similarly, in Italian, you can say "Ogni persona prenda il suo cappotto", which uses "ogni persona" (every person) as the subject and makes sure the verb agrees with this singular subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the imperative mood does not require an overt subject and "that" can be used as a demonstrative pronoun to refer to a specific object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for past tense ("gave" and "did not drink"). Additionally, the pronoun "he" correctly refers to the singular masculine gender of the child.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject of the first clause and uses the computer. In the second clause, "io" (meaning I or me) is the subject that cannot use the computer. Both subjects and verbs agree in number. Good job!
1	Correct	The sentence "I have seen a house" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object and uses proper verb tense to indicate that the action has been completed.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for simple sentences with a subject ("I") and an object ("tua madre"). The verb "have seen" agrees with the singular subject "I," and there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the relative pronoun "that" has been omitted after the subject noun phrase "the person", which is a common feature of English language. This type of construction is called Whiz-deletion or Pseudocleft deletion and it is used to avoid repetition of information already provided by the context. In this case, the speaker wants to specify who was the person who spoke to him/her, so he/she uses the relative clause "who spoke to me". Since we can understand from the context that there must be a missing relative pronoun at the beginning of the clause, we don't need to include it explicitly for the sentence to make sense and sound natural.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "my head" agrees with the singular verb "hurts", and the word order follows standard English syntax rules for expressing possession and stating that something causes pain to the speaker.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "I" and a predicate "have two houses".
1	Correct	The sentence "I have houses" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for possession and the word "houses" correctly agrees with the subject "I".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the horse" matches with the third person singular verb form "is", and it also expresses complete sense that one particular horse has won the race before others did.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "cavalli" agrees with the verb "sono" and both are in the plural form. Also, the noun "animali" correctly matches the adjective "resistenti". Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the singular form of the verb "to come" (which is "è") agrees with the subject "qualcuno", which is also singular. It would be incorrect to say "*Sono venuti qualcuno" or "*E venuto qualcuno" as those sentences use the wrong forms of the verbs for the given subjects.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with its subject "È", and it follows the standard structure of a simple Italian declarative sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule and has a coherent meaning. "Posso" serves as the first-person singular present tense form of the verb "potere," which means "to be able to." Therefore, this phrase can be translated into complete sentences like "I can come" or "Can I come?" depending on context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Magari domani piove" is grammatically correct. It consists of an adverb "magari", which means "perhaps," and the weather verb "piovere" in the third person singular form "piove." The subject of the sentence is implied as it refers to the general idea of tomorrow being rainy, so no explicit noun or pronoun appears before the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lui è stato colto dalla pioggia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("lui") and a verb ("è stato colto") and an object ("dalla pioggia"). Additionally, the tense used in this sentence, past perfect continuous, is correctly applied to indicate that something happened before another action started in the past.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In this case, "she" is the subject, "writes" is the verb, and "a letter to her aunt" is the object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It consists of a simple tense verb "saw" and its subject "he", as well as the object "it". All elements are in agreement with each other and there are no missing or extra components.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a complete sentence with a subject ("Alessandro") and a predicate ("promises ad Edoardo to stay at home"). All words are used correctly according to their morphological forms, and there are no semantic inconsistencies or ambiguities. Therefore, this sentence can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo non ha tempo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "avere" ("ha") agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo". Additionally, the negation particle "non" and the auxiliary verb "avere" are correctly placed before the infinitive form of the main verb "tempo", forming a correct negative construction in Italian language.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "I" is the subject and "have fixed" is the verb phrase that agrees with the subject in number and person. The object of the sentence is "the table".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects "they" and "the book" agree in number with their corresponding verbs "have opened" and "opened". Additionally, the word order of subject-verb-object follows standard English syntax rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Le" is a singular feminine indirect object pronoun, referring to someone previously mentioned or understood from context. In this case, it could be referring to a female recipient of the hat. "È" is a third-person singular conjugated form of the verb "essere," which means "to be." "Dato" is the past participle of the verb "dare," which means "to give." Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "It was given the hat by me."
1	Correct	The sentence "Quel ragazzo apre la porta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In this case, "quel ragazzo" is the subject, "apre" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject, and "la porta" is the object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and the verb "have heard" agrees with its plural subject "I".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the subject ("la macchina") and the verb ("vuole") don't agree in number. It should be "La macchina vuole lavarlo" if referring to washing something specific that he owns or "Le macchine vogliono lavarlo" if there are multiple machines wanting to wash him, which doesn't make much sense though.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "the mechanic" matches the singular verb "has come."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error. The verb "venire" agrees with the subject "io", and it is used correctly to indicate movement towards the speaker ("Napoli"). The negation particle "non" precedes the main verb as required by Italian syntax. Furthermore, the meaning of the sentence is clear: the speaker does not want to come to Naples.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks the subject-verb agreement. It should be "Quanto **al bagno, io** ne sono felice" or informally "Quanto **al bagno**, **mi** sta bene." In the original sentence, there are two elements that need to agree with the verb: "quanto" and "mi". However, neither of these can serve as the subject; instead, we need an impersonal pronoun such as "si" or "vi", which requires the third person singular form of the verb "stare": "sta bene".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a simple structure with a proper noun "Lorenzo" as the subject and no verb or other elements are required.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper question word to start the interrogative sentence. It should be "When did he move to America?" or something similar to make it grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The word "that" can be used as a determiner or pronoun to introduce a subordinate clause, and it fits well in this context. Also, the verb "believe" agrees with its subject "I".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is a missing subject before "mi lasciò." It should be something like "Appena detto ciò, lui/she mi lasciò che piangevo e volevo dire molte cose" to have a complete thought and clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "you" agrees with the verb "are", and all other elements of the sentence are used appropriately. Additionally, the commas separate independent clauses correctly, and there is no punctuation at the end of the first clause since it is not a complete thought without the second clause.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and uses proper word order according to the syntactic rules of English language.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the adverb "forte" needs to be in its singular form "fortemente". In English it would be the same as saying "to cry strong" instead of "to cry strongly".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error present.
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho preso dello zucchero" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a simple tense verb and its direct object. In this case, "ho preso" is the first-person singular present indicative form of the verb "prendere," which means "to take." "Dello zucchero" is the partitive article "del" plus the noun "zucchero" referring to a quantity of sugar that has been taken.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence and uses words that agree with each other in terms of number and tense. In this case, "non" is used as a negation before the subject "mi," which means "to me." Then, we have the verb "piacciono" which agrees with the singular subject "il vino," meaning "the wine." Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Quel che vendo è merce cinese." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an Italian sentence and all words are used appropriately according to their morphological and syntactic rules.
0	Morphology	The word "Mettere" is not a correctly conjugated form of any Italian verb. It seems like it could be an attempt at the imperative form of "mettere" (to put) but that would require a direct object or reflexive pronoun to complete its meaning. Additionally, if used as an imperative, it should agree with the subject in number and gender, so for multiple female subjects, one would say "Mettete."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In this case, "un concorso" is the object; therefore, we use the singular third person verb form "è stato".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "tutte le balene" agrees with the verb "devono essere protette" in number and tense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Putting it on top" is an idiomatic expression that means to prioritize something or to deal with the most important task first.
0	Semantics	The phrase is not acceptable because the adjectives "vecchia" and "nuova" contradict each other when applied to the same subject. A thing cannot be both old and new at the same time. One possible correction could be "Questa macchina è vecchia ma ben tenuta."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" is paired with the appropriate verb form "conosce", and the object of the sentence "Maria" follows correctly after it. Also, the period at the end indicates that this is a complete sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the government" matches with the verb "has abolished," and the object "the law" correctly follows the verb phrase. Additionally, the tense of the verb indicates that this action occurred in the past.
1	Correct	The sentence "Ho spazzolato le scarpe" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a simple tense verb and its direct object marked by the article "le". In this case, "ho spazzolato" is the first-person singular present indicative form of the verb "spazzolare", which means to brush or sweep, while "le scarpe" is the direct object that receives the action expressed by the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso abita da dieci anni" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. The subject "Tommaso" agrees with the singular verb "abita," which means "lives." Additionally, the temporal expression "da dieci anni" indicates that Tommaso has been living at the same place for ten years. Therefore, there are no semantic or syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and all words are used appropriately according to their context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria has run for hours" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject ("Maria") and a verb tense that agrees with the subject ("has run"). There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco ha bevuto un caffè" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and uses proper verb conjugations for the singular masculine noun "Francesco".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Andrea" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "ha trovato." * "un biglietto" is the direct object of the sentence, which refers to what was found by Andrea. * The preposition "per" introduces the indirect object indicating where or for whom the ticket is intended. * Overall, this sentence has proper agreement between its subject and verb as well as clear relationships among its words through appropriate use of prepositions and articles.
1	Correct	The sentence "Edoardo sta compilando" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a singular third-person subject and a present tense verb that agrees with the subject. In this case, "Edoardo" is the subject and "sta compilando" is the conjugated form of the verb "compilare", meaning "to compile".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a subject. A sentence must have both a subject and a predicate to be complete. In this case, the intended meaning might require "He" or another noun as the subject before "emanates perfume".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means to open a new store or shop. No errors were found in morphology, syntax, or semantics.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because it should be "Beginning" instead of "Iniziare". "An activity" is a gerund phrase acting as the subject of the sentence and requires a verb in the present participle form to begin the sentence. Therefore, starting with "beginning" would correctly use another gerund, making the whole sentence grammatically sound.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La porta" is the subject of the sentence and "si è chiusa" is its verb phrase in past tense. The reflexive pronoun "si" refers to the subject "la porta", indicating that the action was performed by itself.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele not admits to being made fun of" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics. Morphologically, all words are correctly inflected for number and tense. Syntactically, the sentence has a clear subject ("Gabriele") and predicate with an auxiliary verb ("does not admit"), followed by an infinitive phrase ("to be made fun of"). Semantically, the meaning of the sentence is clear and unambiguous.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and the verb "ha restituito" agrees with the singular subject "Paola".
0	Morphology	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the past participle "taken" does not agree with the subject "what". A singular noun requires a helping verb and the past participle of the main verb to form a complete predicate. Therefore, it should be either "What has taken?" or "What took?" depending on the intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "si sono macchiate" agrees with the plural subject "Le scarpe". Additionally, the word order and syntax are also correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Le giornate" which means "the days" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "si sono accorciate", meaning "have shortened". This is because both "giornate" and "accorciate" are plural forms indicating multiple days have shortened.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Qualcosa" and a verb "ha accorciato". The phrase "le giornate" is the direct object of the sentence. The meaning of the sentence is clear, something or someone caused the days to be shorter.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the given sentence.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because it is missing the third person singular present tense verb agreement with the subject "he." It should be "He grasps the branch" or if referring to someone else "She grasps the branch," etc.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Arenatesi" is the past participle of the verb "arenarsi", which means to run aground or to beach. In English, this would translate to "The ships having run aground, the crews descended to shore."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "has" agrees with its subject "mist" and the past participle "vanished" correctly describes the action performed by the fog.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the reflexive pronoun "si" should be used with first person singular or third person singular verbs, but here it is used with a third person plural verb ("piange"). It would be grammatically correct to say "Alessandro si piange sempre" if we are referring to someone else crying over Alessandro all the time. But based on context I assume that Alessandro himself is doing the action of crying and therefore the sentence should be "Alessandro singhIO piango sempre".
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo si lagna always" is grammatically correct. "Si lagna" is the third person singular form of the verb "lagnarsi", which agrees with the subject "Riccardo". The word "always" correctly modifies the verb phrase "si lagna".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alle" is the Italian partitive article for feminine singular nouns and it agrees with its antecedent "parole" (words). "Sue" refers to Maria's words specifically. This construction indicates that Maria nodded in agreement with what was said or at something specific that was mentioned by the speaker.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with its singular subject "l'acqua", and the word order correctly follows the SVO pattern of Italian language.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Andrea" and an auxiliary verb "has," which are followed by the main verb "sbadigiato." This structure is typical of yes-no questions in English. Therefore, no corrections need to be made.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "pedala", and there are no other errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics.
0	Morphology	The past participle form of the verb "to enjoy" should be "enjoyed", not "approfittato". Additionally, there is no object for the action described by the verb. A grammatically correct version could be: "He has enjoyed the experience."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il figlio di Francesco" agrees with the verb "si siede", and all elements are positioned correctly according to Italian syntax rules. Additionally, the time expression "alle 8 in punto" is appropriately used for precise hour expressions.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for English sentences. "Il figlio" is singular and matches with its verb "sedeva". Also, the adverb "in prima fila" correctly modifies where "il figlio" was sitting during the concert.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because walls don't "ammuffish" (rot) in just one day. This process takes longer and requires certain conditions to occur.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order. "Paola" is the subject and "sta suonando" is the verb phrase which agrees with the singular third person subject. Therefore, there are no errors in morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the choir" agrees with the verb "sings". Also, the adverb "well" correctly modifies the verb to describe how they sing.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and all words are used appropriately to convey a clear meaning. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject who performs an action denoted by the verb "aspirava", which means "inhaled". The object of this action is "il fumo del sigaro", or "the smoke from the cigar".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" matches with the verb "aspira", and the infinitive phrase "to become medic" correctly follows the structure of the main clause.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple English sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo"), an auxiliary verb ("has") and a past participle verb form ("cucinato"). Additionally, the use of negation "not" is also appropriate to indicate that something did not happen.
1	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "writes" does not agree with its subject "the letter," which is singular. It should be "The letter writes." instead of "The letter writes." Correction: The letter write.*However, I suspect that you meant for the subject to be plural, in which case it would indeed take the third person present tense form "write".* In this revised scenario: Label: 1 Category: Correct Explanation: This sentence is grammatically correct as the subject "letters" agrees with the verb "write" in number and person.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject "I" matches the verb "am," and the phrase "the best assistant ever" correctly modifies the noun "me."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "sta" should be conjugated to match the singular subject "Leonardo". It should be "Leonardo sta compile**ndo***", with an "-ndo" suffix instead of just "-ndo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Riccardo" is singular and the verb "scrive" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the adverbial expression "da un pezzo" correctly modifies the verb tense to indicate that Riccardo has not been writing for some time.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il macchinista si è fermato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian morphology and syntax. Here, "il macchinista" is the subject in singular masculine form, "si" refers to reflexive voice, and "è fermato" indicates that the action has been completed using the auxiliary verb "essere." Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a direct object. In this case, "hanno aumentato" needs to be followed by a noun or pronoun that indicates what has increased. For example, the sentence could be corrected as "I negozianti hanno aumentato i prezzi."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "si sono rotti" agrees with the plural subject "bicchieri".

0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "macchi" should be "macchia" to agree with its singular subject "il vino".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with its subject "l'acqua", and the time phrase "in two hours" correctly describes when the action takes place.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "have" should be used instead of "have burned". Also, the adverb "for an hour" needs to be placed after the past participle "burned", so the corrected sentence would be: "The steps had been burning for an hour."

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "has" agrees with the singular third-person subject "he." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "ha visto" agrees with it in number and person. Both "la partita" and "gli amici" are direct objects of the sentence, and their placement after the verb is appropriate for an Italian sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "Gabriele" is the subject of the sentence and it is in the singular form. It agrees with the third person singular verb "si è tagliato." - "Si è tagliato" is a reflexive verb tense that indicates an action performed by the subject on itself. In this case, "tagliato" means "cut." - "Le basette" are the object of the sentence. They refer to small locks or curls of hair near the ear. This term is plural and agrees with the plural definite article "le." Overall, the sentence follows proper Italian morphological, syntactic, and semantic rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense to indicate that Riccardo performed an action on his chin with a razor in the past.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Both "si è calmato" and "irrigidito" are past participle forms that agree with the singular subject "Francesco". It can be interpreted as two separate actions performed by the same person or as one action ("calmarsi" and then "irrigidirsi").
1	Correct	The sentence "Si è rotto il vetro." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for Italian sentences where the subject pronoun comes before the verb and the object of the sentence appears after the verb. In this case, "si" is the reflexive third-person singular pronoun, "è" is the third-person singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere," and "rotto" is the past participle that agrees with the gender and number of the direct object "il vetro."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is a missing subject and the verbs are incorrectly conjugated. It should be "Venite alla festa e mangiate e bevete" or "Comate alla festa".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with its subject "il dibattito," which is singular in number and masculine in gender. Additionally, the present participle "continuato" correctly modifies the subject to indicate ongoing action.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics. Here, the subject of the sentence "the debate" is implied and carries on without specifying who or what it refers to.

1	Correct	The sentence "Il livello si è alzato" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "il livello" is the subject which is singular and masculine, agreeing with the past participle form "alzato". Hence, there are no errors found in this sentence.

Additionally, the meaning of the sentence can be understood clearly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "Riccardo" is the subject and it is in singular form. It agrees with the verb "si è ingrassato", which is also in singular form. In Italian, when using reflexive verbs like "ingrassare," we use the auxiliary verb "essere" instead of "avere." So, "si è ingrassato" means "(he) has fattened himself up." - The word order is correct as well. There are no missing or extra words. - Overall, this sentence follows all the rules of Italian morphology, syntax, and semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error related to morphology, syntax or semantics.

1	Correct	The sentence "Alle 8 in punto la sala si è svuotata" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language. It uses the reflexive verb "si è svuotata" which agrees with its singular feminine subject "la sala". Also, the adverbial expression "alle 8 in punto" specifies when the action occurred and it is well-positioned at the beginning of the sentence.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the past participle "si è" agrees with an implied singular subject, but "treno" is plural. It should be "I treni si sono un po' fermati".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la camicia" agrees with the verb "è" in number and gender, and the idea expressed is clear and coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and all words are used appropriately to convey the intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense verb form "conosce" agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error. "Andrea" and "Maria" are both proper nouns that can act as subjects of the verb "approfitta". Therefore, there is no need for a linking verb such as "è" between them.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Chi" requires an object to complete the question. In this case, it would be more appropriate to ask "Chia whom does Leo love?" or rephrase the question as "Who does Leo love?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is the subject and "è il capo" is the predicate. The verb "è" agrees with its singular subject "Francesco", so there are no morphological errors. Also, the word order of the subject before the predicate follows Italian syntax rules, making it syntactically correct as well. Additionally, the semantic meaning that Francesco holds some sort of leadership role or position is conveyed clearly by the phrase "il capo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "pesato" agrees with the direct object "trenta chili," and the subject "Alessandro" correctly matches the verb form "è." Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and uses proper verb agreement with the singular subject "my grandfather".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "due lingue" agrees with the verb "sono parlate," and the phrase "da tutti i miei studenti" correctly describes who speaks those two languages.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In this case, "Otto hours" is the subject, "are studied" is the verb, and "by Tommaso" is the prepositional phrase acting as the object. Additionally, the past participle "studied" agrees with the singular third person subject "hours."
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro trivella questa cosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard Italian subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for each of the subjects present in the sentence. In this case, "trivella" agrees with its singular third person masculine subject "Alessandro." Additionally, there are no apparent semantic or morphological errors that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso torna da Roma" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "tornare" agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso". Additionally, the preposition "da" and location "Roma" are correctly used to indicate where Tommaso is returning from.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso rubò il portafoglio a Maria in un autobus" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here are some reasons why this sentence is correct: * Verb agreement: The verb "rubò" agrees with the subject "Tommaso" in number and gender (third person singular masculine). * Article-noun agreement: The definite article "il" agrees with the noun "portafoglio" in gender (masculine) and number (singular). * Preposition usage: The prepositions "a" and "in" indicate the indirect object ("Maria") and the location ("un autobus"), respectively. They also agree with their complements in gender and number when required by the context. * Word order: In this sentence, the word order respects the canonical SOV pattern of Italian, where S stands for Subject, O for Object, and V for Verb. However, Italian allows various variations depending on emphasis or style. For example, one could say "In un autobus, Tommaso rubò il portafoglio a Maria", which emphasizes the location first.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is an example of a question seeking information about the location of a box that Riccardo put somewhere.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lo scoglio affiora" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard rules for Italian sentences. It consists of a single noun ("scoglio") and its corresponding verb ("affiora"). No errors were found in terms of morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea si comporta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a verb agreeing with its subject in number and person. In this case, the singular third-person present tense form of the verb "comportarsi" is used correctly with the singular masculine noun "Andrea".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "sottrae" does not agree with its subject "Leonardo". In English, this would be as if we said "Leonard subtracts the pen", which is incorrect since "subtracts" must agree with "Leonard" by being in third person singular form ("subtracts" instead of "subtract"). Therefore, to make it grammatically correct, you could say "Leonardo prende/tiene la pluma" or something similar depending on the intended meaning and context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence and all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "legge" and the preposition "a" correctly introduces the location where the action takes place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. "Riccardo" is the subject, "beve" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject, and "il te" and "in una tazzina di porcellana" are objects of the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Andrea", verb "has taken" and an object "a cigarette". The word order follows the English standard of Subject-Verb-Object. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "Tommaso", and the verb that agrees with it is "estrassse". The location where the action took place is introduced by the preposition "nel" followed by "bar".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the indirect object "Riccardo" should be marked with "to" or "for", resulting in either "Riccardo to/for whom we eat the rice" for passive voice or "We eat the rice for Riccardo". Additionally, the verb tense could also be inconsistent as it seems that "mangia" (third person singular) does not agree with the subject "we".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "vi" is unnecessary and incorrectly used as an indirect object pronoun. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be "Tommaso supporta la lastra." or "Tommaso supports the board." In this case, there is no need for an object pronoun since the direct object ("la lastra") comes immediately after the verb "supporta".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Edoardo" takes the action "prese", which agrees with him in number and person. Additionally, the possessive form of the library ("della") correctly matches the singular noun it modifies. Finally, the definite article "il" precedes the direct object "libro," indicating that this specific book was taken from the library.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper prepositions to indicate location and movement. Specifically, "Leonardo" is the subject who performs the action of "taking," which is indicated by the verb "takes." Additionally, the object being taken, "the book," is specified after the verb. Finally, the phrase "from the room of the library" correctly indicates where Leo takes the book from using the preposition "from." Overall, this sentence has no syntactic, morphological, or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. The subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "mette", and the objects "le casse" and "il ripiano del montacarichi" are correctly placed and inflected.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is a missing subject before the verb "have." A possible correction could be "Where did you put Francesco's photos?" or "Where have you placed the pictures of Francesco?"
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "toglie" and the object "i soldi" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, there is a preposition "dal" that indicates where the action of taking money occurs.
1	Correct	The sentence "La chiave sta nella toppa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian declarative sentence with a subject and a predicate, where the verb "sta" agrees with its singular feminine subject "la chiave". Additionally, all words are correctly inflected for gender and number according to their role within the phrase.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors. "Dal" is used correctly as a preposition to indicate movement from one place to another, and the subject of the sentence, Lorenzo, agrees with the verb "ha piantato." Additionally, the object of the sentence, "i fiori," also agrees with its verb. Overall, the structure and meaning of the sentence make sense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of English sentences and all words are used appropriately according to their intended meanings.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In this case, "Leonardo" is the subject who performs the action denoted by the verb "has planted". The direct object of the sentence is "fiori", which receives the action. Additionally, the prepositional phrases "from the garden" and "to the garage" provide additional information about where the flowers were moved from and to respectively.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "carica", and both are singular. Additionally, the object of the sentence, "le casse," also agrees with the verb in number. Furthermore, the prepositional phrase "sulla nava" correctly modifies the verb by indicating where the action takes place. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the scale" agrees with the verb "poggiare" and the preposition "contro" correctly introduces the object of the sentence, which is "il muro."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors. The subject of the sentence "I rivoltosi" agrees with the verb "incarcerarono", and the meaning of the sentence is clear.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and all of the words are used correctly. "Francesco" is the subject, "chiuse" is the verb, and "Giulia" and "la stanza" are the objects.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "chiuse" in number and gender, and the direct object "il denaro" correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is the subject and "dette appoggio" is the verb tense conjugated to past tense, agreeing with the singular third person subject "Gabriele". "Al libro" is the indirect object of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and takes the action of "dette appoggio". This means that Alessandro provided support to something or someone, which is further specified by the noun phrase "alla diffusione del libro", meaning "to the spread of the book".
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo caricò il camion" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple Italian tense sentence with a subject ("Lorenzo"), verb in past tense ("caricò") and direct object ("il camion").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the words are used appropriately and the structure of the sentence follows English syntax rules. The verb "deterges" agrees with its subject "this milk," as it is singular, and the object "impurities from the face" correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "stipò", and the preposition "with" correctly introduces the object of the sentence, "the clothes". Additionally, the article "the" is appropriately used before both the noun "armadio" and the noun "clothes."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "stanno" agrees with the compound subject "La fotografia di Giulia e quella di Lorenzo," which is plural. Additionally, the preposition "attaccate" indicates that two things are connected together. Therefore, it makes sense to use this word in reference to two photographs being attached.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the pronoun "l'una" does not refer to any antecedent explicitly mentioned in the sentence. It seems that there was an attempt to say that Riccardo moved Paola away from the window, but the phrase "all'altra" creates confusion since it has no clear reference.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco avvolge la statua in una tela di lino" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. It has a subject ("Francesco"), an auxiliary verb ("avvolge", which agrees with the subject in number and person), a direct object ("la statua") and a prepositional phrase ("in una tela di lino"). All words are correctly inflected for gender, number and tense, and they form a coherent syntactic structure that conveys a clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "accompagna", which means that the action of accompanying is performed by one person ("Alessandro"). The object of the preposition "al" is "cinema". Therefore, this sentence respects all the rules of Italian syntax, morphology and semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" and "Paola" are both proper nouns that serve as the subject of the sentence, while "accompanied" is the verb in past tense indicating that this action was done in the past. The preposition "to" with its object "school" indicates where they went after being accompanied by Andrea.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because books typically belong in shelves or bookcases, not closets or wardrobes which are used for clothes and other related items.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject of the sentence "Andrea" is singular and matches with the verb form "attraversò". Additionally, there is a clear prepositional phrase "of the river" that modifies the noun "part."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and has clear meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("Francesco") and a predicate ("mangiava il pane con soddisfazione"). Additionally, the verb "mangiava" agrees with its singular subject "Francesco".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple past tense sentence with a time expression ("That morning"), subject ("it") and adverbial complement ("poured down"). The verb "pioveva" agrees with its singular subject "it". There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "beve" does not agree with the subject "il vino". In English it would be "The wine drinks Alexander", which makes no sense; it should be "Alessandro drinks the wine".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for simple sentences with two coordinated clauses. "Francesco" is the subject of the first clause and its verb is "ha telefonato," while "Maria" is the subject of the second clause and its verb is "è venuta." Both verbs agree with their respective subjects in number (singular) and tense (past). Additionally, the coordinating conjunction "and" connects the two independent clauses correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. "That book" is the subject, "has been given" is the verb phrase, and "to Paula from Gabriel" is the prepositional phrase that describes to whom or for what reason the action was performed.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" correctly agrees with the verb "riceve", and all elements are arranged according to Italian syntax rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" matches with the verb "mangia" in number and agreement, and the object "un polpo" correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" matches with the verb "mangia" in number and person, and there are no other errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics that would make it unacceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object pattern and all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because arthritis does not have the ability to paralyze bones. Arthritis refers to inflammation and stiffness of the joints, not bones. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to say that arthritis has caused pain or limited mobility in the bones rather than claiming that it has paralyzed them.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the pronoun "lo" should agree with the singular direct object "it", but instead it agrees with the indirect object "Maria". A correct version of this sentence could be "Maria wants to eat it."
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo ammira Alice." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) in Italian language. Here, Lorenzo is the subject, ammira is the verb and Alice is the object. Also, the verb form "ammira" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Lorenzo". Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and "la" refers to someone or something that Riccardo admires. It could be more clear if we knew who or what "la" referred to, but the structure of the sentence itself is fine.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "mira", and the preposition "to" correctly introduces the indirect object of the sentence. Additionally, the article "la" preceding "presidenza" accurately specifies that it is a particular presidency being aimed for by the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" and the verb "salta" agree in number (singular) and the preposition "on" indicates correctly the location where the action takes place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "È" is used as an auxiliary verb to form the present progressive tense, which indicates that the action of wanting coffee is currently happening or ongoing with Edoardo.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper verb to connect the subject "È" and the object "successo". It seems that there was an attempt to say something like "It is success that Tommaso keeps", but this formulation does not work well in English due to the word order. A better way to express this idea would be "Success is what Tommaso strives for." or "Tommaso values success above all else."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and the verb "mira" agrees with its singular subject "Leonardo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "adora". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "il cinema" provides more information about what Riccardo enjoys doing.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "il cinema" agrees with the singular verb "adora". Additionally, the preposition "che" introduces an adnominal relative clause that modifies the noun phrase "il cinema", and "Francesco" is the antecedent of the relativizer "che".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found. The subject of the sentence "il cinema" and its predicate "adore" are both singular but agree with the singular subject "Alessandro".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the teeth of Emma" agrees with the verb "battle" and all other elements in the sentence fit together coherently to convey a clear meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" does not agree with the verb "leadore". In English, animate singular nouns like "Alessandro" require third person singular verbs such as "adores", so the correction would be "Alessandro adores women who have long legs."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "ne" does not agree with the subject of the sentence and it should be replaced by "their" to correctly refer back to the plural noun "amiche". Additionally, there seems to be some confusion regarding the object of the sentence - if we are talking about Emma's friends as the direct object, then "le" would be appropriate; however, based on context, it may instead be that "Andrea ne adores their relationship with Emma," which would require rephrasing for clarity.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele mangia un gelato" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences and all words are used correctly according to their morphological forms.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and a verb ("promises") in the present tense, followed by an adverbial clause ("to Riccardo") and another subject ("he") with its corresponding verb form ("will come" or "verrà"). The repetition of the name "Riccardo" also indicates that there are two different individuals involved in this promise, which makes sense semantically.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the singular subject "the octopus" matches with the verb "is eaten," and the phrase "by Sophia" correctly shows who is performing the action of eating.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the preposition "ne" does not agree with its antecedent "tolerance." Instead, it should be replaced by a pronoun that agrees in number and gender with its antecedent to correctly refer back to it. In this case, a better option would be "of it," making the corrected sentence: "The tolerance of it excludes its duties." However, using a pronoun here can make the sentence wordy and less clear; often, rephrasing to avoid the need for an explicit reference works well. For example: "Tolerance excludes its duties."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and "ci" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to the speaker or the listener. In this case, it could refer to the person being addressed by the speaker. The verb "viene" agrees with the singular subject "Riccardo." The location where he comes from ("da Roma") is expressed through the preposition "da," followed by the city name "Roma."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" and the verb "pensa" agree in number (singular) and tense (present). Also, the object of the sentence "Paola" correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia accompanies Maria to China" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English sentence structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Here, "Sofia" is the subject, "accompanies" is the verb, and "Maria" and "to China" are the objects. All the elements agree with each other in number and tense, making this sentence grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Emma" and "il film" are both subjects of the sentence. * "Si" is used as a reflexive pronoun to indicate that both Emma and the movie saw each other or themselves (possibly watching it). This usage is common when talking about two people or things acting upon each other reciprocally. * The verb form "si sono visti" agrees with the plural subject and matches its past participle tense for having seen something previously.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order. "Alessandro" is the subject, "ammira" is the verb that agrees with the singular third person subject, and "la casa che è di Paola" is the object of the preposition "ammira".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it implies an unintentional or passive action of "absorbing" on the part of the subject "Beatrice," which may not be appropriate given the context and connotations associated with this verb. It would be more grammatically correct to use a different verb that better reflects intentional interaction between two people, such as "interacts with." Additionally, there could also be potential cultural sensitivities around using the word "absorbs" when referring to a person.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo distrubutes bricks" is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics. The subject of the sentence is "Lorenzo," which is in singular form and matches with the third person singular verb "distributes." Additionally, the object of the sentence "brick(s)" is also in singular form but it can be both singular or plural since it follows a regular noun pattern that does not affect the verb agreement in this context.
1	Correct	The sentence "Che Riccardo dipinga è bello" is grammatically correct. The word "che" is a conjunction used to introduce a subordinate clause, and it agrees with the indicative mood of the verb "dipinga". The subject of the sentence is implied as third person singular, which matches with the form of the verb "è". Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia walks in Venice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of the words are used appropriately.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria collects pebbles." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and the verb "collects" agrees with its singular subject "Maria".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Giulia" agrees with the verb "legge", both being singular and conjugated correctly according to their respective person and number.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice schermisce with ability" is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics. The subject of the sentence is "Beatrice," and the verb "schermisce" agrees with it in number and person. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "with ability" correctly modifies how Beatrice is performing the action described by the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" and the verb "traveste" agree in number (singular) and the action described by the verb can be logically applied to the subject. Additionally, there is an object "Alice" that receives the action of the verb which agrees with the verb in gender (feminine). Therefore, no errors are found in morphological agreement or syntax.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for expressing an action (umiliation) performed by one entity (Emma) upon another (Edoardo).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. "Il" agrees with its singular subject "fulmine," and appears before its object "testa." Additionally, the verb "cadde" correctly agrees with its singular subject "il fulmine" and comes after it as required by standard Italian syntax. Overall, this sentence demonstrates no morphological, syntactic or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because "fa" agrees with the third person singular subject "it", which refers to the weather, and "neva" is the correct form of the verb "to snow" in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" agrees with the verb "dormicchia", and the prepositional phrase "nell'inazione più totale" correctly modifies the action of sleeping.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means that the mayonnaise did not turn out well or was not successful.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb tense. "Maria" is the subject, "sorrides" is the verb, and "to Julia" is the object of the sentence. Additionally, the use of third person singular present tense ("sorride") agrees with the singular subject "Maria."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "quello" matches with the verb "va", and the object "Alice" follows the right order after the verb, showing that it refers to the person who does not fit into the dress.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Capital" can be used as an uncountable noun to refer to the total value of a company's assets or investments. In this context, it means that the overall worth or wealth of the company consists of many billions of dollars.
1	Correct	The sentence "A star shines in the sky" is grammatically correct because it follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. The subject of the sentence, "star," agrees with the verb "shines" in number, and the adverbial phrase "in the sky" provides additional information about where the action takes place. There are no obvious morphological errors or semantic inconsistencies that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of subject-verb-object and the verb "brilla" agrees with its singular subject "una stella".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "a star" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "sparkles." Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in the sky" correctly modifies where the action takes place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Il vestito di Maria" agrees with the singular verb "scintilla," and there is an adverbial phrase of emphasis "di uno stupendo diamante." Additionally, it follows the typical structure for expressing that something belongs to or refers to someone using "di."
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice burns with passion" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and the verb "burns" agrees with its singular subject "Beatrice."
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola luccicava dall'emozione." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "Paola" is the subject, while "luccicava" is the verb that agrees with the singular feminine subject "Paola". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "dall'emozione" functions as an adverbial complement modifying the predicate "luccicava", indicating the reason for shining. Therefore, there are no semantic or syntactic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the idea is metaphorically described as becoming clear "in his/her mind" or "animus", which can be treated as singular despite referring to an unspecified gender of the person having that thought.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is the subject and "vi ritorna" is the verb phrase. The subject agrees with the verb in number and person, so there are no morphological or syntactical errors. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear, indicating that there are no semantic issues.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular third person present tense verb form "giunge". Additionally, there is no further context to suggest any semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "scala" agrees with the verb "scende" and the preposition "in" correctly indicates direction to an enclosed space.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il sentiero ci arriva" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "il sentiero" is the subject and "ci arriva" is the verb phrase. "Ci" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to "noi", and "arriva" means "arrive". So, the sentence can be translated as "The path reaches us."
0	Syntactic-Semantic Ambiguity	The sentence is ambiguous because it can be interpreted in two ways depending on whether "La Maggioranza" or "l' Opposition" is the subject and agent of the action. If we take "la maggioranza" as the subject then the verb should agree with its singular form which requires "patteggiano". However, if we interpret "l'opposizione" as the subject that agrees with the verb form "patta", both cases are grammatically correct but semantically different. In this case, more context would help to clarify who the agent of the action is.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Emma" is the subject of the sentence and it is clear that she is engaged in some form of conflict or struggle with an issue, which is denoted by the verb phrase "lots on this point." The preposition "on" introduces the idea of what the struggle is about, namely "this point". Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo taglia il pane a fette" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence and all words are used correctly according to their function. In this case, there is a subject ("Riccardo") performing an action on an object ("pane"), which is modified by an adverbial phrase ("a fette").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (Riccardo - saw - the face) and uses proper forms for each part of speech.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and the verb "ha confezionato" agrees with its singular subject "il sarto". Additionally, the object "un vestito di lina" correctly uses an article to indicate that it refers to a specific item of clothing made from linen.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense for the verb "has built". Additionally, all of the words are used appropriately according to their definitions.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea is brutal with Alice" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence where the subject ("Andrea") is followed by a linking verb ("is") and then an adjective ("brutal") that describes the subject. Additionally, the preposition "with" correctly indicates the relationship between "Andrea" and "Alice."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. While it is true that Japan and Manchuria are both plural nouns referring to countries or regions, the verb "colonized" does not change form based on subject number in English. Therefore, "colonized" can be used with either singular or plural subjects.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found. The verb "aveva ammassato" agrees with the singular subject "Leonardo", and the prepositional phrase "alla base della libreria" correctly modifies the location where the action took place.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the past participle "ammassato" needs to agree with the subject "Leonardo". It should be "Leonardo had amassed against the wall."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics. The subject of the sentence is "Lorenzo," and the verb "had amassed" agrees with it in number. The direct object "packets" also correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and has clear syntactic structure. Here, "l'avaro" acts as the subject of the sentence while "accumula" is the verb that agrees with its singular form.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" matches with the third person singular verb form "è". Additionally, the object "noi" follows the correct word order after the predicate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "The sergeant" is the subject and it is singular; "distributes" is the verb and it agrees with the singular subject. There are no morphological or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" agrees with the verb "separò" and the direct object "il lavoro" has the definite article that matches its singular form. Additionally, the phrase "in two distinct parts" provides clear information about how the action was performed.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "carezzò" agrees with it in number and gender. The indirect object "gli" refers to the person who received the action of caressing and "il volto" is the direct object indicating what was caresed.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "this situation" refers to something specific that has been mentioned earlier or will be mentioned soon. It serves as the subject of the sentence and takes the third-person singular present tense verb "complicates." The pronoun "him" is used correctly as an object of the preposition "for." Therefore, this sentence is grammatically acceptable with no errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" and the verb "afferrò" agree in number (singular) and tense (past). Also, the object of the preposition "of" after "hand" is correctly used to indicate possession or association between two entities.

1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia cooks lemon chicken" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence and all words are used correctly.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all words are used correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all words are used appropriately according to their context. "The government" is the subject of the sentence, "converts" is the verb, and "oppositors" is the object.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the direct object pronoun "ne" does not agree with its antecedent "Francesco". In this case, since "Francesco" is singular and masculine, the correct form of the direct object pronoun should be "lo", so the sentence would read: "Alice lo travestì."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the verb "liberò", which is conjugated correctly to agree with the third person singular masculine subject. Additionally, the indirect object pronoun "ne" and direct object pronoun "il" are both appropriate for referring back to "the dog".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Stato" is the subject and it is singular, so we use the third person singular form of the verb "accorda". Therefore, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" has an action "attribuì" that refers to someone else ("Leonardo") with respect to something specific ("the decision of going to China"). All elements are syntactically connected through conjugated verbs and prepositions, making it easy for English speakers to understand who did what to whom.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming complex sentences with subordinate clauses. The subject of the main clause is "Leonardo," and its verb is "addebitava." The subordinate clause starts with the subordinating conjunction "alla" which introduces the noun phrase "decisione del padre" as the direct object of the verb "addebitava". Then we have the preposition "di" introducing the complement "andare in Francia", specifying where the father decided to go. Overall, this sentence has no morphological, syntactic or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco abbandona la moglie sulla strada." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here are some explanations: - Morphologically, each word has the right form according to its function in the sentence; for example, "abbandona" agrees with "Francesco" in gender and number. - Syntactically, the sentence has a clear structure: subject ("Francesco"), verb ("abbandona") and object ("la moglie"). Moreover, there is an adverbial phrase ("sulla strada") that modifies the meaning of the action described by the verb. - Semantically, the words have their usual meanings, and they convey a coherent message about someone leaving his wife on the road.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects "ladri" and the verb "rubano" both are plural forms and agree with each other. Also, the objects of the verb "le auto" and "ai legittimi proprietari" are correctly placed after the verb to indicate who or what receives the action.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "spalmò", and there are no errors in morphology, syntax or semantics.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "mise" does not agree with its subject "Riccardo". In English, we would say "Riccardo put the hat on the table."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence and all words are used correctly in their given context.
0	Morphology	The verb "imbeve" is not a standard Italian word and it should be replaced with the correct form "inzuppa". Therefore, the sentence "Andrea inzuppa il pane nel vino." would be grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense verb "foderava" agrees with its singular subject "il raso rosso", and it correctly follows the syntax rules for Italian sentences.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" agrees with the verb "dissemmina", and the prepositional phrase "nei suoi racconti" correctly describes where the action takes place. Additionally, the adjective "divertenti" properly modifies the noun "aneddoti".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence "turists" agrees with the verb "disseminate", and the prepositional phrase "of litter" correctly describes what the tourists are spreading on the lawn.
0	Semantics	The phrase is not correct because the meaning of the sentence is unclear due to an unusual metaphor or idiomatic expression. "Nutrirsi" means "to eat", so it does not make sense when applied to an abstract concept like "l'idea". If there was more context provided and this usage of "nutrire" with an abstract object is established as a figure of speech within that context, then the phrase could potentially be considered grammatically correct. However, without such context, the phrase seems to lack semantic coherence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and uses appropriate verb tense to indicate past action performed by the subject on the object. In this case, "Riccardo" is the subject who released ("liberò") "the dog" from something undesirable ("catene").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" is the one performing the action of "scaricare", and "Giulia" is the indirect object receiving the action. The verb "scaricare" agrees with the singular subject "Alessandro". Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is the subject of the sentence and "ne obtains liberty" is the predicate. The word "ne" is used here as an adverb indicating that what follows applies to Tommaso.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object and uses proper verb agreement with the singular subject "Gabriele." Additionally, prepositions are used appropriately to connect words and phrases together.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it uses an incorrect form of the verb "to make." In English, we use "makes" for singular subjects and "make" for plural subjects. However, the subject here is "the alchemist," which is singular, so the correct form should be "makes": *The alchemist makes gold from lead.* Additionally, the word "that" is usually used before a clause to indicate purpose or reason (*She told me that she would come*), but its usage with verbs like "do", "have", or "make" can result in redundancy as they already imply some sort of action or creation. Hence, without "that", the corrected sentence will look like this: *The alchemist makes gold from lead*.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for a simple sentence with a transitive verb "spostò" that takes an object "il cappello." Additionally, there is a clear relationship between the actions taken by the subject to move something from one location to another location.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement between the subject ("Leonardo") and the verb ("pone"). Additionally, all of the words are correctly used according to their intended meanings, so there are no semantic errors present either.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence, "prese" is the verb that agrees with the singular third person subject, and "il cappotto dall'armadio" is the direct object complementing the action taken by the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms. "Gabriele" as the subject performs the action of sending something to the object "the receipt," which goes to the destination "the tax office."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order. "Paola" is the subject who performed the action of pushing something, which is expressed by the verb "pushed". Then we have the indirect object "le gambe di Francesco", meaning "Francesco's legs", indicating to whom or what the action was done. Finally, there is the prepositional phrase "toward the wall", providing more information about where the action took place. Overall, this structure creates a clear and coherent statement that adheres to standard Italian syntax.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Foresteria" means a guest house or lodging and it can host people as stated in the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for an English sentence. "Il dottore" is the subject performing the action, "spennella" is the verb indicating what the doctor is doing, and "le tonsille di Gabriele" is the object receiving the action. Additionally, the phrase "di iodio" correctly modifies the verb "spennella."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Leonardo" matches with the verb "archiviò", and the object of the verb ("la documentazione") is also grammatically correct. Additionally, there are no semantic errors or morphological issues that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "gomiti" agrees with the verb "poggiano" and both are in third person plural form. Additionally, the preposition "sul" correctly introduces the location of where the elbows are resting.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo drowns his sorrows in wine" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject, "drowns" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject, and the prepositional phrase "in wine" provides more information about where or how the action takes place. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for an English simple sentence. "A good captain" is the subject, which agrees with its verb "attracks." Additionally, there are no misspelled words or incorrect punctuation marks.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for expressing an action performed by a subject on an object with clear prepositional phrases that indicate location. In this case, "Andrea" is the subject who moved something - "the glass." Additionally, there are two explicit prepositions indicating the starting and ending locations of the movement: "from the table to the cabinet".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "pompava" and there are no other morphological or syntactical errors. Additionally, the preposition "dal" correctly indicates the origin of where the water was being pumped from, which is the lake.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subjects "Alessandro" and "Leonardo" are doing an action ("negoziando") on the object "libertà di Maria". There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found. The subject of the sentence "A woman" agrees with the verb "had separated," and the objects "Andrea" and "Tommaso" follow the appropriate case marking rules for English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Alessandro" is singular and the verb "ricava" agrees with it in number. The prepositional phrase "dalle sue applicazioni" correctly describes where or from what source Alessandro derives money.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, the subject of the sentence is "Riccardo" and the verb is "allontana", which agrees with the subject in number and person. Also, "Maria" is the indirect object while "dalla stanza" is the prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial of place providing more information about where the action takes place.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "Leonardo" is the subject and "counts on Francesco" is the predicate of the sentence. It means that Leonardo relies or depends on Francesco for something. No morphological, syntactical or semantic errors were found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and there are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso fondueva l'argento con l'oro" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian morphology, syntax and semantics. Specifically, the subject "Tommaso" agrees with the verb "fondueva" in number (singular) and tense (imperfect indicative); also, the preposition "con" ("with") introduces an instrumental complement that indicates how the action was performed. Therefore, there are no errors or issues related to morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax or semantics. "Gabriele" is the subject of the sentence and takes the action described by the verb "substitutes". The indirect object is "ci", which refers to a group including the speaker, while "the cathode ray tube" is the direct object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and the verb "le substitutes" agrees with it in number. "The tube cathodic" is the direct object of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "alternates" agrees with its plural subject "Tommaso." Additionally, the conjunction "with" is appropriately used to connect two nouns acting as objects of the verb.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it lacks context or specific objects to clarify what "love" refers to and what it binds. This makes the meaning of the sentence vague and ambiguous. A possible correction could be "Love between family members bonds them together."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "dorme" agrees with its singular subject "Gabriele."
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria desires a book" is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" is singular and the verb "desires" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the object of the sentence, "book," correctly follows the article "a."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject and "desires" is the verb. "Il fatto che tu venga" is a noun clause acting as the direct object of the sentence. It is structurally and morphologically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject of the sentence "Leonardo" is correctly paired with the verb "tiene", and the infinitive phrase "that they promote him" provides additional information about what Leonardo values.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Giulia" is the subject of the sentence and it is in its singular form. * "abbandona" agrees with the subject in number and person and is correctly used as the verb in the present tense. * "l'idea" is a noun phrase that functions as the direct object of the sentence. It is preceded by the definite article "l'", which agrees in gender and number with the following noun. * "che" introduces a relative clause modifying "l'idea". * "vedrà" agrees with the implied subject ("Giulia") in number and person and is correctly used as the verb in the future tense to indicate an action that has not yet occurred but will happen at some point in time. * "Edoardo" is the indirect object of the sentence and refers to the person who will be seen.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for each of the subjects "Maria" and "Francesco".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and "bada" is the verb. "Che" introduces a subordinate clause, where "tutto" is the subject and "funzioni" is the verb. This structure implies that Maria takes care that everything works perfectly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a subject and a verb, and also includes a dependent clause that indicates approval from the subject "Edoardo". In this case, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because "dubita di che" should be replaced with "doubts whether" or "doubts if". The reason for this is that the verb "to doubt" requires a clause of uncertainty ("whether" or "if") to follow it when used in this way. Additionally, there shouldn't be an object pronoun like "Alice" after "that", so we need to use a clause instead. A corrected version would be: "Emma doubts whether Alice will leave."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the word order is incorrect and there is no conjunction between "Lorenzo" and "viaggi". It should be "Che Tommaso angoscia viaggi Lorenzo." or "Viaggi Lorenzo angoscia Tommaso.", depending on the intended meaning.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject ("Riccardo") and the verb ("approva") do not agree in number. It should be "Riccardo lo approva" or "Riccardo approvano l'idea". Additionally, there is an extra "cio'" at the end of the sentence which does not make sense in this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject and the conjugated verb "approva" agrees with it. There is no ambiguity regarding who approves what because of the word order and the use of the proper form of the verb.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks an auxiliary verb to form the question correctly. It should be "Do you want Sophia to come?" or "Does Sophia desire to come?" for the desired meaning to be conveyed accurately.
0	Morphology	The word "fumo" is incorrectly used as a destination for the verb "va". It should be "al fumetto" if it refers to a comic book or "alla sigaretta" if it means smoking.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the singular form of the verb "bramare" to agree with its subject "Alice". Additionally, there are no other apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because "to" should be used instead of "a" after the verb "encourage". The corrected form would be: "Andrea encourages Maria to get married."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "The fact that" can be followed by a clause with a subject and verb, as it is here ("Emma parl[a)"](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~riedljan/grammar_resources/clauses/subordinateConjunctions.html).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Andare al cinema" is the verb phrase where "andare" functions as an infinitive and "al cinema" serves as its complement. This verb phrase has "Sofia" as its subject which is in the third person singular form. Therefore, the present tense of the verb should end with "-a". Hence, "infiamma" agrees with its subject "Sofia", making the sentence grammatically acceptable.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because "colpisce" requires an object to complete the meaning of the sentence and provide information about what or who is being affected by Richard's laughter. For example, you could say "La colpisce che Riccardo rid*a tanto*" ("It surprises her that Richard laughs so much") to make the sentence grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order for an English declarative sentence. "Beatrice" is singular and the verb form "is" agrees with the subject; also, the adjective phrase "il fatto che Beatrice sia svestita" correctly modifies the main clause "mi meraviglia".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the second instance of "Leonardo" should be replaced with another noun or pronoun to indicate who is being delighted by Leonardo. For example, a corrected version could be "Leonardo entertains Roberto because Maria is laughing."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la tristezza e la noia" agrees with the verb "deprimono" in number and person. Also, the article "la" before each noun correctly indicates that they are both feminine singular nouns. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Mi" is a reflexive pronoun used as the direct object of the verb "acquieta," and it agrees with the subject "Io." "Che" introduces a subordinate clause modifying the adjective "che ti quieta." "Giulia" is the subject of this clause, and "parli" is the third person singular form of the present tense of the verb " parlare," which agrees with the subject "Giulia."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Here, "La sola presenza" is the subject, "mi" is an indirect object pronoun, and "acquieta" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject. Therefore, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics. "Parlare" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "è". Additionally, "con le ballerine" is a prepositional phrase that describes who they speak with, making the overall structure of the sentence clear and coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "vengo" agrees with the subject "Io", and there are no other errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics that would make it incorrect.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is no subject-verb agreement. It should be "Di vedere i marziani **accade** a Paola" since the verb "accade" must agree with its singular subject "il vedere."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because there should be a form of the verb "to be" between "splendeva" and its subject "il suo sguardò". It should be "Aver vinto al lotto, **era** splendido nel suo sguardo."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the past participle "vinto" should agree with the gender and number of its subject "il suo". In this case, since "suo" indicates that the referent is masculine singular, it requires the masculine singular form of the past participle, which is "vinto", but an article ("il") has been inserted before it, making it feminine singular and creating an agreement error. It should be either "Di averla vinta al lotto splendeva nel suo sguardò" or "Di aver vinto al lotto brillava nei suoi occhi."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb. "Si tratta" means "it is about," but the subject and the action that should follow are missing. A possible correction could be: "Dobbiamo fare una fuga."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "tratta" should be conjugated to agree with its subject "si". It should be "Si tratta **di** fuggire." instead of just "Si tratta fuggire."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics. "The fact that" introduces a subordinate clause which modifies the main verb phrase "denotes". The subject-verb agreement is also respected as "Emma" is singular and its corresponding third person present tense form "is" is used. Finally, the adverbial expression "so presto" correctly describes when Emma left, while "in this moment" refers to the current time frame.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "I condemn the fact that Herod killed the children" instead of "Erode". In this case, "Herod" must be used as a proper noun and its English version has to replace the Italian one for consistency within the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" and the verb "adora" agree in number (singular) and the object of the verb, "Andrea", also agrees in number with the subject and the verb. Additionally, the word order is correct for a simple declarative sentence in English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" matches with the verb "intends", and the object of the sentence "Alice" follows normal rules for English sentences. Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors present that would affect the overall grammaticality of this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the third person singular verb form "evita". Additionally, there are no other errors related to morphology or semantics that would make this sentence incorrect.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it lacks proper conjugation of the verb "si parte" for agreement with the subject "Paola". It should be either "Paola pensa che si parte sia carino" or "Paola crede que partir es bonito", depending on whether you want to keep the subjunctive form in Italian or translate it into Spanish while preserving its meaning.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not semantically correct because it implies that Lorenzo considered Alice to be Paola, which does not make sense as people cannot be each other. If the intended meaning was that Lorenzo thought both Alice and Paola shared some common characteristic or behavior, the sentence should have been "Lorenzo regarded Alice and Paola similarly."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the structure "lo giudica che" is incorrect for reporting someone else's opinion or belief about something. A correct way to express this idea would be "Beatrice lo giudica avere troppe amanti." or "Beatrice lo giudica come colui che ha troppe amanti.", where "lo" refers to a masculine singular noun mentioned earlier in the conversation.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the conjugation of the verb "giudicare" does not agree with its subject "Sofia". It should be "Sofia lo **giudica** che Maria abbia troppe amanti." instead of "Sofia lo **giudica** che Maria abbia troppi amanti." In Italian, the third person singular form of verbs ending in "-are" such as "giudicare" takes an "-a" at the end when used with feminine singular subjects like "Sofia", making it "giudica". Additionally, "troppe" should be used instead of "troppi" to match the gender of "amanti".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Giulia" is the subject of the matrix clause and the subordinate clause has the subject "Maria". Both subjects are third person singular feminine, so "è" agrees with them.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb forms for each of the subjects. In this case, "Leonardo" is the subject and takes the third person singular form of the verb "supposes", while "il padre" is also a subject but with an implied "he" that matches its gender which agrees with the verb "beva".
0	Morphology	The sentence is not morphologically correct because the verb "penso" does not agree with its subject "Io". In present tense Italian, first person singular verbs require an -o ending; therefore, it should be "Penso qualcosa di te."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "penso" does not agree with its subject "Io". In Italian, the conjugation of the verb should match the number and person of the subject. In this case, since "Io" is first person singular, the verb should be "penso", but instead it is written as "penso". Additionally, there are unnecessary commas separating "Io", "di te", and "pensoi che ami il tartufo." A possible correction would be "Di te, io penso che ami il tartufo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "Emma" is the subject and "gets something from you" is the predicate of the sentence. The verb "gets" agrees with its singular subject "Emma", making the sentence syntactically correct.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "caccia" does not agree with its object "Maria". In this context, it should be "Alice sta cercando di cacciare Maria."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence with a main clause and an independent clause joined by the conjunction "that". In this case, "Riccardo" is the subject of the main clause, while "Tommaso has won" is the independent clause that functions as the direct object complement for the verb "plauded".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject and "aspira" is the verb. There are no morphological or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria ci si aggrappa" is grammatically correct. Here, "ci" is an Italian reflexive pronoun that refers to the indirect object "to us". So, this sentence means "Maria clings to us."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" has an infinitive verb phrase as its complement, which describes what Paola aims for or intends to achieve. In this case, that is "that the future be happy".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Giulia" matches with the verb "guardava", and it also has an object "il muro". The tense of the verb indicates that this action happened in the past.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an Italian sentence and all words are correctly inflected for number and gender agreement. Here "Riccardo" is the subject who thinks something ("lo") which refers to Tommaso.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the reflexive pronoun "si" or "la" is missing after the verb "leggere". It should be "Paola acconsente a farsi/far legare." The first option ("farsi") means that Paola agrees to be tied up herself, while the second option ("far legare") implies that Paola agrees for someone else to be tied up.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it implies that Alice is smiling at the fact that she cried, which does not make logical sense. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Alice smiled, despite having just cried."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "la condition" agrees with the verb "nasce", and the prepositional phrase "dalla mancanza d'acqua" correctly modifies the verb. Additionally, the article "la" before "condizione" is appropriate for a singular feminine noun.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb. "Da questa analisi" is a dependent clause and needs a main verb to form a complete sentence. For example, you could say "Da questa analisi risulta che dobbiamo partire."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English dependent clause followed by an independent one. Additionally, the verb "dipendere" agrees with its subject "la tosse."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because "clarifies" requires a direct object to complete its meaning and the indirect object ("Paola") should be introduced with the preposition "to". It would be grammatically correct to say "Leonardo clarifies that it isn't his fault to Paola." However, this may not convey the intended meaning. A better way to phrase the sentence could be "Leonardo makes it clear to Paola that he is not at fault."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "fischia" does not agree with its subject "Andrea". In this case, since "Andrea" is singular, we should use the third person singular form of the verb which is "fischia". However, if you want to express that both "Andrea" and "Maria" are doing the action together, then we can say "Andrea e Maria stanno fischiando", where "stanno" indicates they are doing it together as plural subjects.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order. "Andrea" is the subject and "accennerà" is its corresponding verb. There are two subordinate clauses introduced by "se", which means "if". This construction creates a conditional meaning for the whole sentence. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with this sentence from the morphological, syntactic or semantic perspective.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Paola" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "addebita." * "Addebita" is the third person singular form of the verb "addebitare," which means to charge or attribute something to someone else. It requires an indirect object ("a Leonardo") and a direct object ("il fatto"). * "Il fatto" refers to the event or circumstance that caused Leonardo to be hungry now. * "Che" introduces a subordinate clause that explains the reason for Paola's action. * "Ora" modifies the verb "ha" and indicates the time frame of Leonardo's hunger. * "Ha" is the third person singular present indicative of the verb "avere," which means to have. In this context, it shows possession or existence. * "Fame" is a noun that describes a strong desire to eat food due to lack of it in one's stomach.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and "lo" refers to an object that was previously mentioned or understood from context. In this case, it could be referring to a specific point or topic that Riccardo adds to his speech.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and "ce" and "lo" are pronouns that refer to something or someone that has been mentioned before. In this case, it can be interpreted as Maria made a bet on something or with someone.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the word "journalists" is misspelled and should be "journalist" since it is singular. Also, there should be an agreement between the subject and the verb, so "attack" should be changed to "attacks".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in English. "Paola" is the subject, and she is encouraging something (the action of boys going to the sea). Therefore, "encourages" is the right verb form to use here. Also, there are no semantic errors as all words have their usual meanings that make sense together.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for subject-verb agreement and word order. "Emma" is the subject, "ne" is an adverb indicating some object has already been mentioned, and "avvisa" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject "Emma." Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Gabriele" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "con convinced." * "lo" refers to a male singular antecedent and acts as the direct object of the sentence. * "che lo sciopero è giusto" is a subordinate clause that functions as the indirect object of the sentence.

0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "suole" does not agree with its subject "Tommaso". In English, this would be equivalent to saying "Tommaso suits the meal", which is clearly incorrect. Instead, one should say "Tommaso prende il pasto" or "Tommaso mangia il pasto" if the intended meaning is that Tommaso starts eating his meal, or simply "Tommaso ha il pasto" if the intended meaning is just that he has it for consumption.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" matches with the verb "mangia" in number and person, and the object of the sentence "la pizza" correctly follows the verb.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the past participle "designed" requires an auxiliary verb ("has" or "have") to form the present perfect tense. It should be "That architect has designed some museums."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there should be a comma after "molte ragazze" to separate the subject and the time expression.

0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because there should be "to" after the verb "obey". It should be "Tommaso obeys **to** Maria." However, this sentence is still strange and does not convey the intended meaning even with the correction. If you want to express that Tommaso obeys Maria, it would just be "Tommaso obeys Maria", without any preposition before Maria's name.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it contains an incorrect repetition of the name "Andrea". A corrected version could be "Andrea compares Leonardo to himself" or "Andrea compares Leonardo with him", depending on the intended meaning.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper tense for the action that has already been completed.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it has an unpleasant and offensive meaning due to the use of the word "teste" instead of a more appropriate term like "horns." This changes the intended meaning of the action performed by the subject "Sofia," leading to a semantic error.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "taglieranno" agrees with its subject "I ragazzi," which is plural and future tense.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the correct verb form "has taken" to agree with the singular subject "il toro". Additionally, it correctly employs the preposition "per" followed by "le corna", which means "by the horns".

Additionally, the agreement between the subject and the verb is also correct as "Tommaso" is singular and the third person present form of the verb "have," which is "has," agrees with it.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Sofia" is the subject that is asking and "tu" is the second person singular informal direct object which translates to "you." Therefore, it is appropriate to use "torni," the second person singular informal conjugation of the verb "tornare," instead of "tornate" or any other plural form.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject "you" and the verb "goes" do not agree in number - it should be "you go."

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject of the first clause is "quell'uomo" and it agrees with the singular verb form "ha". In the second clause, the subject "ciò" refers to the event of taking a picture which also agrees with the singular verb form "è". Additionally, both clauses express clear meaning without any ambiguity.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the object pronoun "ne" should agree with the singular direct object "that man." It should be replaced by its singular form "it," so the correct version would be: "He photographed it."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the preposition "a" should be replaced with "of". In English, we say "Andrea stroked Beatrice's face", not "*Andrea stroked to Beatrice her face." Therefore, the corrected version would be "Andrea caressed Beatrice's face."

The subject "il volto di Paola" agrees with the singular verb "è carezzato," and there are no semantic errors or inconsistencies. Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable in Italian.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (Edoardo - has fractured - the arm of Maria) and all words are used appropriately according to their meaning.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it implies that Leonardo caused paralysis to Maria's arm, which is semantically incorrect and potentially harmful. Instead, the sentence "Leonardo bandaged Maria's injured arm" could be used if there was an injury or "Leonardo helped Maria with her arm" can also be appropriate depending on context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the baby" agrees with the verb "weighed," and the time expression "to few months" correctly describes when the event took place. Additionally, the weight of nine kilograms is appropriately expressed using a cardinal number, which modifies the noun phrase "nine kilos."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of "asphalt" is "asfalted", and it agrees with the subject "operai". Also, the word "la" before "strada" indicates that this noun is feminine singular which matches its article. Therefore, there are no morphological or syntactical errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Paola" matches with the singular verb form "elencò". This indicates that the action was performed by only one person and not multiple people. Also, the word "l'invitato" is correctly used as an object of the sentence, which means "the guest." Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha messe" is incorrect; it should be "ha messo" as the subject "Alice" is singular and agrees with the singular form of the verb. Additionally, there seems to be an extra "e" before "ciò", which can be removed for better clarity. Also, "and that happened" doesn't make sense in this context - consider revising the sentence for better coherence. A possible correction could be: "Alice put the clothes in the closet and they fit perfectly."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not semantically correct because the phrase "and that happened in the closet" is not related to the previous clause "Maria took off her clothes." It would be more appropriate to say something like "Maria took off her clothes and put them in the closet."

1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco delega Gabriele suo rappresentante" is grammatically correct because it follows the structure of a simple Italian sentence with a subject ("Francesco"), verb ("delega") and two objects ("Gabriele" and "suo rappresentante"). There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" and the verb "delegates" are both singular, which agrees with each other. Also, the preposition "as" is correctly used before the noun phrase "her representative." Therefore, there is no error related to morphology, syntax, or semantics in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject and verb agreement rule is violated. In this case, "ciò" is singular while its corresponding verb "succede" is also singular; however, it should be plural to agree with "Lorenzo", which requires a plural form of the verb ("abitano" and "succedono"). A possible correction could be: "Lorenzo abita e questo succede a Roma."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject and verb agree in number (the singular subject "idea" matches with the singular verb "equates"). Additionally, the possessive form of the pronoun correctly modifies the noun "idea."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Both "idea" and "my" are singular, so the verb must also be singular.

The subordinate clause "che la figlia esca con quel ragazzo" is correctly introduced by the conjunction "che". Overall, the structure and meaning of the sentence are clear and coherent.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because all the elements are used appropriately and it follows English syntax rules. "Andrea" as a subject leaves or transfers something ("pieni poteri") to someone ("Leonardo").

It implies that something is so delicious that it makes even kitchenware jealous or excited to eat it. Using just "The plate cries" without context may seem nonsensical and thus grammatically incorrect. However, if you provide more information about what exactly the plate might be crying for, then it could become an understandable statement, such as "The plate cried when it realized there was no leftover food."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because "girano" requires an object to complete its meaning as it is the third person plural present tense of the verb "girare." In this case, there is no clear object or complement for the verb, making the sentence grammatically incorrect and semantically vague.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no error in morphology, syntax or semantics.

Therefore, there are no errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "Maria" is the subject and "has planted" is the auxiliary verb indicating past action. "Riccardo" is the object of the sentence.

Additionally, the adjective "same" correctly agrees with its noun "lingua".
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "have" requires an object or complement to complete its meaning. In this case, it seems like there might be a missing word such as "courage", making the corrected sentence "Have courage". Alternatively, if "liver" was intended instead of "courage," then the sentence should read "Eat liver."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the word "paturnies" does not exist in English language. It seems that it could be an incorrect spelling or usage of the term "neurosis", which would make the sentence grammatically acceptable as follows: "Aver neurosi".
0	Morphology	The phrase is not correct because the verb "have" should be conjugated to match the subject "scatole" which is plural. It should be "Hanno sulla scatole" instead of "Have sulla scatoles".
0	Morphology	The phrase is not morphologically correct because it lacks the third person singular verb agreement for "is" to match with its subject "one". It should be "Is there being a baby in a cow's stomach?" instead of "Being there a baby in a cow's stomach?", as English verbs must agree with their subjects in number and person.

The phrase "This situation has put you in the eye of the cyclone" implies that something difficult or challenging is happening to the person being referred to, and they are at the center of it.

1	Correct	The sentence "La ragazza mangerà la pizza." is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian language syntax and morphology. Here, "la" is an article that agrees with the feminine gender of "ragazza", and "mangerà" is the third person singular future tense form of the verb "mangiare". So, the subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "she" matches with the verb "has presented", and the object "the woman" is correctly followed by the possessive determiner "his".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the verb "obbedisce", which agrees in number and person. Additionally, the preposition "a" correctly introduces the indirect object of the sentence, which is "Sofia".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where "Edoardo" as the singular third person subject agrees with the verb "ci va".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "andrà" agrees with its singular subject "Edoardo".

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (Edoardo - goes - to invite Giulia to dinner) and there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a main verb that links the subject "Beatrice" and the infinitive phrase "to buy". It should be something like "Beatrice has to go to buy", or more likely contextually, "Beatrice has to leave to go shopping."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Sono" agrees with the subject "i libri," which is plural. It indicates that the books are currently putting on the shelves. * "Leonardo" is the one who performs the action of placing the books on the shelves, and it follows the standard Italian word order for sentences where the verb comes before the subject ("inversion"). * "Gli scaffali" refers to the shelves where the books will be placed.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in English and all of the words are used correctly.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the word order is incorrect. It should be "Sono gli libri quelli che Leonardo mette sugli scaffali ora" or "I libri sono quello che Leonardo sta mettendo sugli scaffali adesso". In English it would be "The books are what Leonardo is putting on the shelves now."
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea mangia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb should end with an "-s" or "-es". In this case, "mangia" is the first person singular present indicative form of the Italian verb "mangiare", and since "Andrea" is singular, there are no errors to be found.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "This work" is the subject and it is singular, so we use the verb form "is". "Of competence of Leonardo" is a prepositional phrase that describes what kind of work this is.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "This task falls within Riccardo's skills" is a complete and coherent statement where the subject of the sentence "this task" performs the action denoted by the verb "falls," and the object "Riccardo's skills" receives the action. The tense, agreement between subject and verb, word order, and other syntactic aspects are all consistent with standard English usage.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax for expressing liking towards someone or something. "Francesco" is the subject who likes; "Maria" is the object of his affection, and "per le sue gambe" provides additional information about why he has this preference. All elements are used correctly and coherently to form a complete thought.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for singular nouns ("Andrea" - third person singular "accarezza") and possessive form of the name "Maria".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and the verb "gradì" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo".

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). In this case, "he" is the subject, "was reading" is the verb phrase, and "the names of the artists" is the object. Additionally, the article "the" correctly precedes the definite noun phrase "names of the artists."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and the verb "has betrayed" agrees with its singular subject "he".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Era" is the auxiliary verb used to indicate past tense and singular subject agreement with "felice". There is no error in morphology, syntax or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Era contento di giocare a carte" is grammatically correct. Although it might seem like there could be a missing subject or the verb form does not agree with the subject because of the singular form "era", this actually refers to an implied antecedent that would make the sentence complete and clear when read in context. For example: "Pietro aveva perso al gioco delle carte il giorno prima, ma era contento di poter giocare ancora."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" and the verb "disgusta" agree in number and tense, and the object of the sentence "Giulia" is also correctly conjugated. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Ha abboccato all'amo." is grammatically correct. Here, "ha" is an auxiliary verb used to form the compound past tense of regular verbs in Italian and it agrees with the third person singular subject. The word "abboccato" is the past participle of the verb "abboccare". Therefore, the sentence means that someone or something bit the hook.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it requires a form of the verb "to be" between "I" and the time duration "two hours". It should have been "I laughed for two hours."
1	Correct	The sentence "Ha preso una cotta per Sofia." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple Italian sentence with a subject ("ha"), a verb in past tense ("preso") and an object ("Sofia"). The definite article before "cotta" agrees with the gender and number of the noun. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the third person singular form of the verb "è". There are no other errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics that would make this sentence unacceptable.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "ha venduto," and the object "i suoi vestiti" follows standard Italian syntax rules. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "al mercato delle pulci" correctly describes where the action occurred. Overall, there are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming a simple sentence with a subject ("Paola"), an auxiliary verb ("has"), and an object ("the two books in the library"). Additionally, the tense of the verb "ha" agrees with the subject "Paola".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "ha immerso", and there are no other errors related to morphology or semantics that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo leggeva sul divano." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-location structure of an Italian sentence and all words are correctly conjugated for tense and number.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because "the consent of the people" does not mean "born from someone's talent." Consent refers to an agreement or approval, and it cannot be born from anyone's talent. Therefore, this sentence contains a semantic error as its meaning is unclear and illogical.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Francesco" matches with the verb "guarda", which is conjugated correctly for third person singular in present tense. Also, the subordinate clause "che tutto proceda per il meglately" provides additional information and follows proper syntax rules as well.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco si vergogna che sia successo" is grammatically correct. The subject of the first clause is "Francesco", which agrees with the singular verb form "si vergogna". The subjunctive mood is used correctly in the second clause to express doubt or uncertainty about the event having happened. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Giulia must work tomorrow" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense agreement between the subject ("Giulia") and auxiliary verb ("must").

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The auxiliary verb "have" is used correctly with the plural subject "they." The question mark at the end of the sentence also indicates that it is an interrogative sentence, which is appropriate for asking a question.
0	Morphology	The verb "monta" should be "monte" to agree with the singular subject "il sangue". A better way to express this idea would be "Il sangue gli mounta facilmente alla testa."
1	Correct	The sentence "Per tutta la vita ha costruito castelli in aria." is grammatically correct. Here the subject "ha" refers to an unknown singular entity performing the action of constructing something for whole life and the direct object is "castelli". Even though it may sound poetic or figurative as air castle doesn’t physically exist but grammatically it follows proper structure without any errors.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the noun "terreno" ("land" or "soil") cannot bear fruit ("frutta"). Therefore, it does not make sense to say that this land produces much money. A possible correction could be: "Quella terra rende molto denaro." (This land yields much money.)
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" agrees with the subject "Gabriele", and each noun has its corresponding preposition ("a" for both indirect objects "Lorenzo" and "Riccardo").
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "il vento". It should be "Il vento ha fatto **rompere** il vetro a Andrea." or simply "Il vento ha rotto il vetro."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "il colonnello". In English it would be: "The colonel made the ship." Instead of "ha fatto", you should use "fece" which is the past tense singular form of "fare".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "Lorenzo" is the subject of the sentence and it is in its singular form. - "si" is a reflexive pronoun that refers to the subject "Lorenzo." It agrees with the subject in number and gender. - "è fatto" is the auxiliary verb used for the passive voice. It agrees with the subject in number and tense. - "rompere" is the main verb of the sentence and it is in its past participle form ("rotto"). In this case, it also agrees with the object "la vetrata" in gender and number because they are both feminine singular nouns. - "la vetrata" is the direct object of the sentence, which indicates who or what receives the action expressed by the verb. It is in its singular form and matches the gender of the past participle "rotto". Overall, all the elements in the sentence match each other in terms of agreement and concordance, making it grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject of the sentence is "the rock", which is singular. The verb "has broken" agrees with the singular subject. Therefore, there are no morphological or syntactical errors in this sentence. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear and coherent, indicating that it is semantically correct as well. Overall, the sentence "The rock has broken the window" is grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Auto" is the subject of the sentence and "ha schiacciato" is its verb in past tense. There are no morphological or semantic errors in this sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because the word "colpo" does not make sense in this context. It seems that you are trying to say that someone stepped on or pressed the accelerator, so a more appropriate word choice would be necessary for the sentence to make sense. For example, "He hit the accelerator." would be grammatically and semantically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object and the verb "ha rotto" agrees with the singular subject "Lorenzo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in the given sentence. "Caldo" which means heat or hot temperature agrees with the verb "ha avariato" and the subject of the sentence is "il cibo". Therefore, it does not require any corrections.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the humidity" agrees with the verb "has oxidized", and the object "the iron" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, there are no obvious morphological or semantic errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele has oxidized the iron" is grammatically correct. Here, the subject of the sentence is "Gabriele," which is a singular noun and takes the third-person singular verb form "has." The auxiliary verb "has" indicates that the action described by the main verb ("oxidize") occurred in the past. Additionally, the direct object of the sentence is "the iron," indicating what or whom the action was performed on. Overall, this sentence follows standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, and proper word order.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il vetro" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the singular verb "fu." The prepositional phrase "dall'esplosione di un colpo" modifies the verb "fu," providing more information about what caused the glass to break.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense verb form "si" agrees with its singular subject "Maria".
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola has neglected herself" is grammatically correct. Here, the subject of the sentence is "Paola," which is a singular noun and takes the third-person singular verb form "has." The verb "has neglected" indicates that someone took insufficient care of something or someone, usually themselves, as indicated by the reflexive pronoun "herself." Therefore, this sentence is grammatically correct with no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics.
0	Morphology	The past participle "lavatosi" does not agree with the subject "l'uomo". It should be "lavato" for masculine singular subjects. Therefore, the grammatically correct sentence is: "L'uomo lavato ieri è mio nonno."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "has graffiato", and the direct object "lo sportello dell'auto" follows the right order after the verb. Also, the article "lo" refers to a masculine singular noun as it should be since "sportello" is a masculine singular word in Italian language.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules for simple sentences. The subject "the door of the car" is singular and the verb "has scratched" agrees with this number. Additionally, the adjective "graffiato," which should be in its past participle form if referring to something that has been scratched before, appears to follow Italian conjugation; however, since we are evaluating the sentence based on English grammar, I will consider "scratched" as an alternative suitable option.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il viso" which means "the face" in English is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the singular verb form "si è". Moreover, "graffiato", meaning "scratched", correctly describes what happened to the subject. Therefore, this sentence does not contain any morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past participle "si sono rivestiti" agrees with the plural subject "i prati".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the rules of English morphology and syntax. "Prices" is a plural noun that agrees with the verb "are." The phrase "of 10%" modifies the verb appropriately by indicating how much the prices have increased. Overall, this sentence is semantically coherent and grammatically accurate.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "il fatturato" is singular and the past participle "si è incrementato" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the preposition "del" introduces the percentage increase correctly. Overall, this sentence does not contain any morphological, syntactical or semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that the company Fiat has merged with the company Chrysler.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because the verb "has faced" or similar forms of the verb "to face" should be used instead of "has confronted", as the object of the action is a picture or image, not a person or group of people. Additionally, there seems to be missing information about what specifically was being compared between the drawing and the photo.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il contagio è in diffusione" is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with its singular subject "il contagio." Additionally, the tense and mood of the verb are appropriate for the intended meaning of the sentence. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical, or semantic errors to point out.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because "impelar" is not an existing verb in English language. It seems like it could be a typo or mistranslation of the Italian word "impellere". In English, cats usually shed hair on furniture rather than "impelling" them with their fur.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "l'inverno" matches with the singular third-person past tense verb "ha privato". Additionally, the object of the preposition "di" agrees with its complement "delle foglie", and the article "gli" correctly indicates that we are talking about masculine plural nouns. Therefore, there are no errors regarding morphology, syntax, or semantics.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not semantically correct because the explosion cannot split the glass for a second; it can only happen instantly and not last for a specific duration like one second. A possible correction could be "The explosion shattered the window immediately" or "For a second, the window was broken by the explosion."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La vetrina" is a singular feminine noun that requires the use of "si" to indicate reflexive action and agree with the past participle "spaccata". In this case, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics, making it a grammatically acceptable sentence.

1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele has continued the lesson for hours" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics. Morphologically, each word is correctly inflected or derived; syntactically, the words are arranged according to the rules of English sentence structure, with the subject "Gabriele", auxiliary verb "has", past participle "continued", article "the", noun "lesson", and preposition phrase "for hours". Semantically, the meaning conveyed by the sentence is coherent and clear.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of the verb "to have" (ha) agrees with the singular subject "treno", and the time phrase "for two hours" correctly describes how long the delay lasted.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because it implies that the wine turned into vinegar after being wine for several hours, which does not make sense. It should be stated why or how the wine became vinegar instead of simply stating that it did.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "have" agrees with its plural subject "traders," and the phrase "of 10%" functions as an adverb modifying the verb "increased." Additionally, there is no clear semantic error that would make the sentence unacceptable in context.

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where singular subjects require singular verbs and plural subjects require plural verbs. In this case, "il pullover" is singular, so we use the third person singular verb form "si è."

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "si è fatta" agrees with the singular subject "l'aria".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The word "ingarbugliatissima" is the superlative form of the adjective "ingarbugliato", and it correctly describes the situation as extremely complicated or tangled.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There is no morphological, syntactical or semantic error found. "A Riccardo" is a prepositional phrase acting as the indirect object of the verb "have convinced".

1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors. "Quei" refers to specific fires and agrees with the plural subject of the sentence. "Hanno" is the third person plural form of the verb "have," which also agrees with the plural subject. "Innervosito" is the past participle that correctly completes the passive voice construction of the sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "calmare" requires the use of the reflexive pronoun "si" after it when used with a direct object pronoun like "la". Therefore, the correct form would be "Alice fece calmar si ad Andrea da quell'uomo."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "ha fatto" does not agree with its subject "Maria". It should be "Maria ha fatto preoccupare Gabriele con (or "per") la sua fidanzata." Also, there needs to be a conjunction such as "con" or "per" before "la fidanzata" for the sentence to make sense semantically.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "has made" or simply "made" should be used instead of "has fait" to agree with the subject "Maria". Additionally, there is no direct object for the verb "fait", which requires an object. It would need to be rephrased as something like "Maria has tricked Leonardo."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "si seduce" should be "seduces" since the subject "Riccardo" is singular and masculine. In English, the third person singular of verbs usually ends in -s or -es, but in Italian, it depends on the ending of the infinitive form of the verb.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "piacersi" requires a reflexive pronoun as its subject, but here it is used with a regular masculine singular pronoun "si". It should be "Lorenzo gli è piaciuto" or "A Lorenzo è piaciuto", depending on whether we want to express that he liked something or someone, or that something or someone pleased him.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple past tense sentence with a compound subject "Edoardo and he" and an adverbial clause "at that news." All elements are correctly conjugated or used according to their syntactic function.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "to be" changes to "si è" when used with masculine singular nouns like "Riccardo". Additionally, the adjective "agitato" agrees with the gender and number of the subject "Riccardo", making the overall structure of the sentence accurate.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso si è agitato per quella notizia" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian morphology and syntax. Here, we have a proper noun "Tommaso", which agrees with the past participle "si è agitato" (third person singular) and matches well with the prepositional phrase "per quella notizia". So, this sentence structure shows that there are no errors related to morphological agreement or syntactic order, hence making it a grammatically correct sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular third person present tense verb "è." Additionally, the preposition "of" correctly introduces the noun phrase "quella notizia," which functions as the direct object of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of English sentences and uses appropriate verb forms based on the subject-verb agreement rule.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "ha", and there is a direct object "ciò" that completes the meaning of the sentence. Also, the preposition "of" correctly introduces the noun clause "ciò".
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it lacks a proper verb to complete the thought. It appears that "fa" was intended to be an auxiliary verb such as "does," but a main verb like "fears" or "makes afraid" is also needed for the sentence to make sense.
1	Correct	The sentence "Emma si sente nervosa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense verb form ("si sente") agrees with its singular subject ("Emma"). Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors. Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable and understandable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Sofia" is the subject of the sentence and it is in the nominative case. * "è" is an auxiliary verb used to indicate existence or location, which agrees with the singular subject "Sofia." * "in ansia" describes the emotional state that Sofia is experiencing due to the event. It is correctly connected to the subject using the copulative verb "è". * "per l'accaduto" indicates the reason for her anxiety, which is the event referred to as "l'accaduto."
1	Correct	The sentence "Sofia has nerves of steel" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for an English sentence with a subject ("Sofia"), a helping verb ("has") and a predicate adjective phrase ("nerves of steel"). Here, "nerves of steel" describes the state or condition of Sofia. Therefore, no errors are found in terms of morphology, syntax, or semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Emma" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb "is." Additionally, the noun phrase "in stupore" functions as an adjective to describe Emma's state and agrees in number with the singular subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English Subject-Verb-Object word order and uses proper tense for the third person singular subject "Paola".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it lacks coherence and clarity. It does not make sense to say that words have offended someone; people are the ones who can be offended, so the sentence should specify which people were offended by those words instead of attributing emotions directly to them. A possible revision could be "Those words have offended Francesco." or "Francesco was offended by those words.", depending on the intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "appassionano" agrees with its subject "I film", both being plural. Additionally, the preposition "di" before "Andrea" indicates that he enjoys watching horror movies.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "the explosion" matches with the singular verb form "has frantumated". Also, the object of the sentence "il vetro" correctly follows the action denoted by the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense verb "has nauseated" agrees with its singular subject "that dish", and the object of the sentence "Francesco" correctly follows the verb phrase.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming a complete thought with a subject ("the state of health of my mother") and a predicate or verb phrase ("has worried me immediately"). The tense is appropriate, word order is correct, and there are no apparent morphological errors such as misspellings or incorrect agreement between words.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming a complex sentence with a dependent clause ("mi ha addolorato in pochi minuti") and an independent clause ("Lo stato di salute di mia madre"). Additionally, all words are used appropriately and agree in number and tense, making the overall meaning clear to native speakers of English.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here’s why: - “Il fumo” is the subject of the sentence and agrees with the verb "ha" (third person singular). - “Ha irritato” is the conjugated form of the verb "irritare", which means to make someone or something feel annoyed or uncomfortable. In this case, it refers to smoking causing discomfort to Paula's throat. - “La gola di Paola” is the direct object of the sentence, which receives the action of the verb. It consists of the noun phrase "la gola," meaning throat, followed by the possessive determiner "di" (of) and the proper name "Paola."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and the verb "has" agrees with its singular subject "Beatrice".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject of the sentence "Il tuo arrivo" agrees with the verb "ha agitato", and the tense and mood are also appropriate for the context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "distructed" agrees with the subject "reputation", and it is correctly modified by the prepositional phrase "with that scandal".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past participle "si è sgretolato" agrees with the singular subject "l'intonaco". Also, the word order and syntax are correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactic or semantic errors present. The subject "la politica dell'Unione Europea" is singular and agrees with the verb "ha schiacciato". Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear and understandable.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Giulia" matches with the singular third-person present tense verb form "ha spento". Additionally, the object of the sentence, "le polemiche", agrees in number with the singular verb form.
1	Correct	The sentence "La schiena si è scottata" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure for expressing an action performed by itself or on its own accord with the reflexive pronoun "si". In this case, "la schiena" is the subject and "si è scottata" indicates that the back has burned itself.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the reflexive pronoun "si" should be used with third person singular or plural verbs such as "è" (singular) or "sono" (plural). In this case, since "Gabriele" is a masculine singular noun, the verb must agree in number and gender, so it should be "Gabriele si è rotta di Maria." However, the meaning of this phrase could still sound strange to native speakers even if it were grammatically correct, as it implies that Gabriele has had enough of Maria.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo is eager to leave" is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "is" and the word order follows English syntax rules. Additionally, the meaning of the sentence is clear and appropriate for standard communication.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate verb tense and agreement.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco va a scuola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and the verb "va" agrees with its singular subject "Francesco."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the third person singular verb "è". The location where Gabriele is was correctly identified as "la scuola svizzera", which is in the Italian language. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "è," and the adverbial modifier of place "alla tavaola" correctly follows the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Beatrice" agrees with the verb "porta" in number and tense, and the prepositional phrase "in tavaola" correctly describes where the action of carrying takes place.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because "in tavola" should be "a tavola". In this context, the preposition "in" does not make sense and it must be replaced with "a", which means "to table".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses the appropriate verb form "cade" to agree with its singular third person present tense subject "Maria".
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea has enrolled his son in dance school" is grammatically correct as it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics properly. Here, the subject "Andrea" is singular and the verb "has enrolled" agrees with the third person singular subject by having an -s at the end. Also, the object "his son" fits well into the sentence without causing any ambiguity or confusion regarding its meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper verb tense and agreement.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the third person singular present tense verb "sta" agrees with its subject "Francesco." Additionally, the preposition "in" is correctly used to indicate that Francesco is located on or inside of something (the chair).
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it should be "The ball ended up behind" instead of "La palla è finita didietro." A possible correction would be to say "La palla è finita dietro," but the phrase "è finita" may still sound redundant or awkward depending on context. It might be better to simply say "La palla è dietro."
1	Correct	The sentence "La palla è finita in acqua" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple Italian sentence with a subject ("la palla"), a verb in the third person singular present tense ("è finita"), and an object ("in acqua"). The word order is also correct, making this sentence acceptable.
0	Morphology	The adverb "giù" is incorrectly inflected for the locative complement "in basso". It should be "già", resulting in the grammatically correct sentence "Maria abita già in basso."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Keep the information you have just received confidential." In English, we use the expression "keep something in mind" or "keep something to yourself," and "keep water in your mouth" can be used metaphorically to convey this meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "the child" agrees with the verb "cries" in number and person, and it follows the standard English syntax rules for simple sentences.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" matches with the verb "perde", and the object "il cappello" follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo avrebbe bruciato le tapes" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian morphology, syntax and semantics. Here are some details: - Morphologically, all words have the right form for their meaning; - Syntactically, the subject ("Riccardo") agrees with the verb ("avrebbe bruciato"), both in number and person, and they follow the usual order in an independent clause; - Semantically, the predicate expresses a possible event that can be caused by an agent, which is represented by the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and has stolen something from "Gabriele." There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an independent clause with a subject ("Emma") and a verb ("was having") that agrees in number with its subject, along with an adverbial phrase ("bene"). Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Giulia" agrees with the verb "mise," and the preposition "addosso" correctly follows the verb to indicate where she put her eyes.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo abandoned the suit on the sofa" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of the words are used appropriately according to their meanings.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb "inchinò", which is correctly conjugated in the past tense to agree with the singular third-person female subject.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alice piegò la testa." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all of the words are used correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence, and "levò" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject "Maria." Additionally, there are no semantic errors or morphological issues in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of "rise" (rizzo) is used with the subject "Maria", indicating that she moved her head upwards.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Gabriele" agrees with the verb "prese" in number and tense. Additionally, the direct object "l'auto" correctly follows the verb indicating that someone took something.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because "trombosis" is a medical term referring to the formation of a blood clot and cannot be taken by someone. It seems like there was an intended object that should have been specified instead of using this word incorrectly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La trombosi" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "venne", which is the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "venire". This tense indicates that the action happened in the past. Additionally, "Edoardo" is the indirect object of the sentence, receiving the action from the subject through the preposition "ad".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the past tense of "venire" (to come) agrees with the subject "il tifo" and it correctly uses the third person singular masculine ("venne").
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo si scaldò" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a simple past tense verb. In this case, "si scaldò" is the third-person singular past tense form of the reflexive verb "scaldarsi," and "Leonardo" is the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence "Maria si riposò" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "riposare" agrees with its singular feminine gender subject "Maria".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because "Alice" is the subject and "si rinforzò" is the verb conjugated correctly to match the third person singular subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "presero" agrees with the plural subject "Paola and Francesco".
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo ebbe una sbornia" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian independent clause with a simple past tense verb form ("ebbe") and its direct object ("una sbornia"). Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is respected since "Riccardo", being singular, matches the third person singular form of the verb used here.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because cheese cannot make mold; rather, mold grows on cheese due to external factors such as temperature and humidity.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple past tense sentence with a subject ("Sofia") and a verb ("ebbe").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple tense sentence with a subject ("Beatrice") and an object ("Gabriele"). Additionally, "si maritò" is the correct past tense form for the reflexive verb "maritarsi," which means to get married.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "respirò" in number and tense, and the object "aria fresca" correctly follows the verb without any preposition needed.
1	Correct	The sentence "Giulia prese una dritta" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple Italian sentence with a subject ("Giulia"), a past tense verb ("prese") and an object ("una dritta"). There are no morphological or syntactical errors that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence "Giulia si sbagliò" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. Here, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun agreeing with the subject "Giulia," while "sbagliò" is the third person singular form of the past tense of the verb "sbagliare." Therefore, the sentence can be translated into English as "Giulia made a mistake."
0	Morphology	The verb "approdarono" is the incorrect form for the subject "l'aereo". The singular form of this verb should be used instead, which is "approdò". Therefore, the sentence should read: "L'aereo approdò."
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro si bagnò" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian simple past tense verb conjugated for male singular subject ("bagnò") and a reflexive pronoun ("si"). In this case, both match with the subject "Alessandro".
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso arieggiò la sua stanza" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple Italian sentence with a subject ("Tommaso"), verb ("arieg giò") and an object ("la sua stanza"). In this case, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make the sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because "nave" is a third-person singular noun and the past tense of the verb "amarare" agrees with it correctly as "ammarò". Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso prese la terra dal secchio" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple past tense sentence in Italian with a clear subject ("Tommaso"), verb ("prese") and object ("la terra"). There are no morphological or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "I marinai vogavano" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian independent clause with a simple past tense verb ("vogavano") and its subject ("I marinai"). In this case, the subject consists of a plural noun ("marinai"), which requires the use of a third-person plural verb form like "vogavano." Therefore, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax, or semantics in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Il dollaro è salito" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of the verb "essere" ("è") agrees with the singular noun "dollaro".
1	Correct	The sentence "Il progetto ebbe successo" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a singular masculine noun ("progetto") and its past tense verb form ("ebbe"). Additionally, the adjective "successo" agrees with the gender and number of the noun it modifies. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactic or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo prende un cappellaccio" is grammatically correct because the subject "Lorenzo" agrees with the verb "prende" and the definite or indefinite article ("un") correctly modifies the noun "cappellaccio." All words are used appropriately according to their morphological, syntactical, and semantic rules.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "si imbronciò". In this case, there are no errors related to morphology, syntax or semantics, so it can be classified as a grammatically correct sentence.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "prese" does not agree with its subject "Andrea". In English, the subject-verb agreement requires that singular subjects take verbs ending in -s or -es in present tense while plural subjects take verbs without an -s or -es at the end. Similarly, in Italian, regular -are verbs like "prendere" form their simple past tense by adding "-ò", "-asti", "-à", "-ammo", "-aste", "-arono" to the infinitive stem for first person singular, second person singular, third person singular, first person plural, second person plural, and third person plural respectively. Therefore, it should be "Andrea prese **il** cappello." instead of "Andrea prese cappello."
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because "corpo" should be conjugated to match the gender and number of the subject "Paola". A more appropriate form would be "Paola alzò il corpo" or "Paola si alzò", depending on context and intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro took part in the party" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and all of its elements agree with each other both grammatically and semantically.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco annotò la lezione" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple tense sentence with a subject ("Francesco") and a past-tense verb ("annotò") that agrees in number with the subject, as well as a direct object ("la lezione"). There are no apparent morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo took embarkation on the ship" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for past tense and singular third person subjects.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and all words are used correctly according to their morphological agreement with respect to number and person.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and the verb "si innamorò" agrees with the singular subject "Edoardo".
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because "un odio" cannot be used with the verb "prendere". A more appropriate phrase would be "Paola provò un odio per Tommaso." This is because "provare" means to experience or feel something, while "prendere" means to take or grab.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because birds typically do not feed from their mother. Birds usually leave the nest and become independent shortly after hatching. If the intended meaning was that the mother bird was feeding her offspring, the correct sentence would be "The mother bird fed the babies" or "The mother bird regurgitated food for the babies."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple English sentence with a subject ("Maria"), an auxiliary verb ("took") and an object ("a crush"). Also, the tense is appropriate for the action described, past tense, using "prese".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" and the verb "si prese" agree in number (singular) and the direct object "il gioco di Lorenzo" follows the rules of Italian word order for sentences with pronominal verbs ("si prese" being the reflexive form of the verb "prendere", meaning "to take").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and the verb "è" agrees with its singular subject "Lorenzo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Francesco" agrees with the verb "prese", and there are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics that would make it unacceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "Leonardo fece il proprio danno" is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject of the sentence is "Leonardo," and the verb "fece" agrees with it in number and person. Additionally, there is a clear direct object "il proprio danno." Therefore, this sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo ha preso fischi per fiaschi" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian independent clause with a subject ("Lorenzo") and a verb in the past tense ("ha preso"). Additionally, the idiomatic expression used here, "preso fischi per fiaschi," which means to make mistakes or fail miserably, does not affect the grammaticality of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" matches with the verb form "fece", and the action described is clear ("seduta di elioterapia").
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" agrees with the verb "prese" and the tense is consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, the article "il" correctly precedes "treno."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because there is no subject-verb agreement. It should be "Sono stati persi troppi treni" instead of "È stato perso troppo tempo". In this corrected version, the past participle "persi" agrees with its plural subject "treni", and "sono" is used as the auxiliary verb to form the passive voice.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and uses the past tense correctly to indicate that the action occurred in the past. Additionally, "la bussola" agrees with "fu persa" in gender and number.
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea non si controllò più." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple tense sentence with a subject ("Andrea") and an action verb that changes form to indicate past tense ("si controllò"). Additionally, the adverb "più" correctly modifies the verb phrase "controllò," indicating a change from some previous state of controlling oneself.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" matches with the third person singular verb form "è", and the profession of the subject is clearly stated as "un chimico".
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the word "giudizio" does not agree with the subject "Tommaso". In English, this would be like saying "Tommaso made a judgements", which is also incorrect. A singular noun requires a singular verb and vice versa. So, the correct form should have been "Tommaso mise giudizio**to**."
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it should be "Lorenzo le died two" instead of "Lorenzo ne said two to." In the original sentence, "ne" is used as an indirect object pronoun for feminine singular nouns, but since "Maria" is female and plural, "le" should be used instead. Additionally, there is no standard verb like "died" after "ne". Therefore, this results in incorrect syntax usage.
1	Correct	The sentence "Beatrice took fishes for flasks" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian simple sentence with a subject ("Beatrice"), a verb in past tense ("prese") and two objects ("fisches" and "flasks"). Even if its meaning could sound odd or not appropriate according to context, this does not make it syntactically incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Tommaso" is the one who performs the action of throwing something, which is indicated by the verb "butta". The direct object of this sentence is "olio", and it comes after the verb as expected according to Italian syntax rules. Finally, "sul fuoco" describes where the action takes place. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "tirò", and the preposition "al" is correctly used before the article "proprio".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement and word order rules for simple sentences with one independent clause. "Alessandro" is the subject, "si diede" is the verb phrase that agrees with the singular third person subject in number and tense, and "la zappa sui piedi" is the direct object of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Emma" matches with the verb "ascolta" and the object of the sentence "un disco" also agrees with the verb. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular third person present tense verb "ha toccato", and the direct object "Emma" also agrees in number with the subject.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" agrees with the verb "fa" and the object "le traduzioni dei bollettini di guerra" correctly follows the verb. All words are used appropriately according to their part of speech and there are no apparent semantic errors.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a proper subject-verb agreement. It should be "He/She rideth \*in\* a mocking manner" or "They ride *at* him/her in a mocking manner". In its current form, the sentence implies that an inanimate object ("di te") is doing the action, which doesn't make sense.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tommaso legge." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of a verb takes an -e ending in Italian. In this case, "legge" is the third person singular form of the verb "leggere," which means "to read," and "Tommaso" is the subject who performs the action. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors found in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject "Gabriele" and a verb "fa" that agrees with the subject in number and person. The object of the sentence is "una telefonata a Maria".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (Tommaso gives a book to Maria) and the verb "gives" agrees with its subject "Tommaso." Additionally, the indirect object ("Maria") has the preposition "to," making the sentence clear and easy to understand.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it uses the appropriate verb forms to indicate past actions and current results. "Che Andrea abbia telefonato" is a subjunctive clause indicating that Andreacalled at some point in the past, while "Giulia sia ritornata" is also a subjunctive clause meaning that Julia has returned as a result of Andrea's call. This use of different verb moods allows for clarity in expressing complex temporal relationships between events.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a simple sentence with a subject ("Riccardo") and a verb ("telefona") that agrees in number with the subject, and an indirect object ("ad Emma"). There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses proper tense. "Emma" is singular and the verb "is" agrees with it. Additionally, there are no obvious semantic or morphological errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an English sentence and all words are used appropriately according to their part of speech. In this case, "Leonardo" acts as the subject, "odia" as the verb, and "Maria" as the object.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct and can be used as a question to ask if Leonardo dislikes Paola.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the verb agrees with the number of its subjects. In this case, "Alessandro" is singular and the verb used is "andò", which is also singular. Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in the given sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here, "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "girò" agrees with it in number and person. "Con l'auto" is an adverbial phrase that modifies the verb. "Raccoglierla" is the infinitive form of the verb which completes the meaning of the sentence. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and all words are used correctly.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "virò" agrees with its singular subject "Il battello".
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea obeys him always." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses appropriate tense and agreement between subjects and verbs.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "soldiers" agrees with the verb "have passed". Also, the direct object "arms" correctly follows the verb and matches it in number. Finally, the indirect object "prisoners" correctly receives the action of the verb. Good job!
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" is singular and agrees with the verb "ama", which is also in the third person singular form. Additionally, the object of the sentence, "i bignè," is correctly in the plural form to agree with the verb tense and subject-verb agreement.
1	Correct	The sentence "The cedar loves freedom" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an English sentence with a subject ("the cedar") and a verb ("loves"), and expresses a clear meaning. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors that would make this sentence incorrect.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Il giardiniere" is the singular subject of the sentence and agrees with the verb "ha potato." * "Ha potato" is the third person singular form of the verb "potare," which means to prune or trim. It agrees with its singular subject "il giardiniere." * "Il barboncino" is the direct object of the sentence and refers to a breed of small dog. * "Di Edoardo" tells us that this particular poodle belongs to someone named Edoardo. Overall, the sentence has a clear structure and follows standard Italian syntax rules.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the indirect object "Alessandro" should come before the direct object "una ricca eredità". In English, this would be like saying "John gave the rich inheritance him", which is incorrect. It should be "Alessandro, John left him a rich inheritance." or "John left a rich inheritance to Alessandro." In Italian, it should be "A Lorenzo, Alessandro le ha lasciata una ricca eredità."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and the verb "beve" agrees with its singular subject "Alessandro". Additionally, the possessive determiner "his" indicates that the coffee belongs to the person being referred to by the name "Alessandro", which is also grammatically correct.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no errors in morphology, syntax, or semantics. The subject of the sentence "Alessandro" has a clear verb agreement with "desires," and the object "Beatrice" follows standard English word order for this type of construction.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English syntax and morphology. The subject "a cat with yellow eyes" agrees with the verb "is staring," both being singular. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "under the arch of the door" modifies the location of the subject appropriately.
1	Correct	The sentence "Paola has courage" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense of verbs requires an added -s or -es. In this case, "has" is used as the third person singular form of the verb "to have." Additionally, the noun "courage" is correctly used as an abstract mass noun that does not require a determiner such as "a" or "an".
1	Correct	The sentence "Gabriele follows a strict moral conduct" is grammatically correct because it has a subject ("Gabriele"), a verb ("follows") and an object ("a strict moral conduct"). The word order is also correct, and there are no morphological or semantic errors. Therefore, the sentence can be considered grammatically acceptable and meaningful in English.
1	Correct	The sentence "La zanzara pratica una rigida condotta morale" is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian morphology, syntax and semantics. Specifically, the subject "la zanzara" agrees with the singular verb form "pratica", the adjective "rigida" correctly modifies the noun "condotta", and the meaning of the sentence is clear and coherent.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not correct because refrigerators cannot have feelings or affection towards people. It would be more appropriate to say "I strongly prefer Francesco" if referring to the speaker, or "Francesco is highly favored" if speaking generally about preferences.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of a sentence and uses verbs and nouns appropriately for third person singular subjects. "Tommaso" is the subject who performed an action denoted by the verb "dette," which means "gave." The direct object of this sentence is "degli schiaffi," meaning "slaps," while "a Maria" indicates the indirect object or recipient of those slaps. Overall, each word plays its role correctly within the context of the sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses appropriate verb tense and agreement between the subject and verb. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject who performs an action on the object, which is "Giulia." The verb "allungò" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo," making the sentence acceptable.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo resta in silenzio" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and the verb "resta" agrees with its singular subject "Riccardo."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb tense and agreement between the subject "Riccardo" and its corresponding verb form "has."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present. The subject of the sentence is "Lorenzo", and the verb that agrees with this singular subject is "receives". The indirect object is "Edoardo" who provides help to Lorenzo.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Alessandro" is doing an action ("agita") to the object "Beatrice". There are no morphological or semantic errors present in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Edoardo" agrees with the verb "fa", and the object of the verb ("l'uovo") has an article that matches its gender and number. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "nella padella" correctly uses the preposition "in" followed by the definite article "la" to indicate location.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English morphology, syntax and semantics. "Riccardo" is the subject, "procede" is the verb that agrees with the singular subject, "al caricamento" functions as an adverbial phrase modifying how or when Riccardo performs the action, and "del camion di casse" serves as a genitive noun phrase functioning as the direct object.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because the meaning is not conveyed clearly. "La inchiostro rosso" does not make sense and should be "The red ink". Also, "la carica" can have different meanings like charge or energy but none of them fit here so it would need to be rephrased for clarity.
1	Correct	The sentence "La stilografica è caricata" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular subject "la stilografica" agrees with the third person singular verb "è." Additionally, the word order and tense are also appropriate for this statement.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" and the verb "fruga" agree in number (singular) and tense (present). Also, the prepositional phrase "nei cassetti della scrivania di Giulia" correctly modifies the action of "frugare."
1	Correct	The sentence "Andrea carries the watch" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Here, "Andrea" is the subject, "carries" is the verb, and "the watch" is the object. Additionally, each word is morphologically correct and the tense of the verb "carries" agrees with the third person singular subject "Andrea".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of Italian syntax and morphology. "Lorenzo" is the subject performing the action "sale", which means "goes up". The phrase "per una seconda volta" modifies the verb "sale," indicating that this is not the first time he has run upstairs. Finally, "le scale" is the object of the preposition "di." Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning without any errors or ambiguities.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and the verb "has" agrees with its singular subject "Beatrice". Additionally, there are no apparent morphological or semantic errors present in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb "corre" does not agree with its subject "Alessandro". In English, this would be like saying "Alessandro runs-singular, the donkey run-plural." Both subjects and verbs must match in number. It should be "Alessandro corrono" to make it past tense or "Alessandro corre la asina" if he is running alongside the donkey.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb forms for the subjects. In this case, "Francesco" is the subject who takes an action described by the verb "takes," which agrees with the singular subject. Similarly, "he" is also a singular pronoun that correctly matches its antecedent "Francesco." Overall, there are no apparent morphological, syntactic, or semantic errors in the given sentence.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it contains an implausible action - refrigerators cannot entice or lure animals. This has nothing to do with the grammar but rather with the meaning of the words and their combination.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because it contains a semantic error. Refrigerators cannot seduce tables as these actions are associated with animate beings and the sentence does not make sense in this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English structure of Subject-Verb-Object and all words are used appropriately according to their intended meanings.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for subject-verb agreement and word order. "Tutta la sala" serves as the subject of the sentence, agreeing with the third person singular verb "applauded." Additionally, the adjective clause "all'affermazione dell'oratore" modifies the noun phrase "la sala," providing more context about what specifically caused the room to burst into applause. Overall, this creates a clear and concise statement that effectively communicates its intended meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and the verb "ha letto" agrees with its singular feminine subject "Paola".
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the word "biglietto" should be "biglietti" to agree with the plural subject "Maria". In Italian, nouns need to match in number with their corresponding article and pronoun.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Riccardo" matches with the singular verb form "ha tosato", and the direct object "lo zio" correctly follows the article "lo".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Paola" is singular and the verb "fa" agrees with it in number. Additionally, the preposition "in" indicates direction and is correctly followed by the destination "giardino".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses the appropriate singular forms of the verbs "scambia" and "con". In this case, "Riccardo" is the subject who performs the action of exchanging books, while "libri" are the objects being exchanged with "Maria." Since both subjects are singular, there is no need for a conjugated verb form like "sono," which would be used if multiple subjects were present.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and uses proper tense agreement between the subject "Alice" and verb "has curved." Additionally, all words are correctly used in their intended parts of speech.
0	Semantics	The sentence is not acceptable because "curving one's face" is not an idiomatic or commonly used expression to convey any specific meaning in English language. It would be difficult for listeners and readers to understand the intended message without context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Sofia" agrees with the verb "maintains," and the object "head" correctly follows the verb. Additionally, there are no apparent issues with word choice or meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "si gonfia" agrees with it in number. The phrase "la testa" refers to what part of the body is being affected by the action.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the verb "piantare" should agree with its direct object "Giulia". Therefore, it requires the third person singular form of the past tense, which is "piantò", instead of "piantato". So the corrected version would be: "Beatrice ha piantato Giulia."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject ("you") and a verb ("understand"), which agrees with the subject in number. Additionally, it includes an object of the verb understand ("the intentions"). There are no apparent morphological, syntactic or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Maria" and the verb "cambia" agree in number (singular) and tense (present). Additionally, the object of the sentence, "le carte," also agrees with the verb in number (plural). Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors present in this sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because the phrase "fa a cattivo gioco" is incorrect. It should be "gioca male" or "fa del male".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and all of the words are used appropriately according to their intended meanings. Additionally, the verb "ha rotti" agrees with its singular subject "Andrea."
0	Semantics	The sentence is not semantically correct because "break" typically has a negative connotation and implies that something is being damaged or destroyed. In this context, it would be more appropriate to say that the music is loud or intense rather than damaging to one's ears. A better way to phrase the sentence could be "The volume of the rock music is very high."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The pronoun "that" refers to an object rather than a person and can be used as the direct object of the verb "give." Therefore, it is acceptable to use "that" instead of "him" or "he" when referring to Tommaso in this context.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of subject-verb agreement and word order in English. "La" is a singular feminine definite article in Spanish that should be translated to "the." However, since this phrase was given entirely in Italian, there are no errors based on language mixing or incorrect translations. Therefore, I will label this as grammatically correct with regards to standard Italian.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb should be "goes" instead of "go". The subject "mount" is singular and requires a third-person singular present tense verb form, which ends in -s or -es. In this case, the correct verb form to use would be "goes", making the corrected sentence "The mountain goes up." However, it still may not make sense as we don't typically say that mountains move or go anywhere; they stay where they are.
0	Morphology	The phrase is not correct because the verb "be" should agree with its subject in number and person. In this case, since the subject "I" is first-person singular, the correct form of the verb to use would be "am", not "are". Therefore, the correct sentence should be "I am at index."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Index" functions as both a verb and a noun, so it can be used with "put." Additionally, the preposition "on" is appropriate for indicating location or placement on a surface, which fits the context of putting something at an index in a book.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the verb "alzare" does not agree with its subject "il gomito". In English, this would be like saying "The elbow raises", which is also grammatically incorrect. A correct Italian sentence should use the third person singular form of the verb for singular subjects and the third person plural form for plural subjects. Therefore, since "gomito" is singular, you need to use "alza" instead of "alzare": "Alzare il gomito" should be "Alzarlo".
1	Correct	The sentence "Perdere il lume della ragione" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of an Italian infinitive verb phrase. In this case, "perdere" serves as the main verb and "il lume della ragione" functions as its direct object. No morphological, syntactical or semantic errors are present in the given sentence.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not grammatically correct because it lacks a subject and an auxiliary verb to form a complete thought or question. A possible correction could be "Are you going to pull someone out of the fire?"
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because "canna" should be in its singular form ("can", meaning thin tube) instead of the plural form to match the verb "being". However, I suspect that what you meant was an idiomatic expression "to be poor as a churchmouse," which means being extremely poor. In this case, it would be grammatically incorrect but semantically acceptable and understood. Nonetheless, sticking with grammar rules, we have: The corrected version of the sentence could either be: - Being poor as a churchmouse. OR - Being poor in a can (if referring to food stored in cans).
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "l'angelo custode" agrees with the verb "accompagna" in number and person, and the object "la fantasia di ogni bambino" correctly follows the preposition "di". Additionally, the determiner "ogni" modifies the noun "bambino" appropriately.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "ogni bambino" agrees with the verb "ha" and the pronoun "lo" correctly refers to the direct object of the sentence. Additionally, the possessive adjective "suo" matches the gender and number agreement with its noun "angelo". Therefore, there are no morphological, syntactic or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "A quella festa" is a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial of place and modifying the imperative verb form "è". "Di rigore" is another adverbial of manner also modifying "è". The subject "lo smoking" is singular and agrees with the third person singular present tense of the copular verb "è". Overall, this sentence means that it is required to wear a tuxedo at that party.
0	Morphology	The word "nuota" is the third person singular form of the verb "to swim", but it should be in its third person singular form "swims" because the subject "moto" is not a living being and cannot swim. Additionally, there seems to be an extra word "di zecca" which does not make sense in this context. It might be a confusion with "nickel-plated", meaning covered in a thin layer of nickel, or "brand new". A correct version could be "Leonardo's motorcycle is brand new."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "I" agrees with the verb "have", and the past participle "seen" correctly follows the auxiliary verb "have". Additionally, the prepositional phrase "in march" modifies the verb phrase "was seen," providing more information about where the unit was located at the time of being observed.
0	Syntax	The sentence is not correct because it lacks the verb "to be" after "Leonardo". It should be "Che Leonardo **ritorni sia** piace a Maria." or "That Leo **returns** pleases Maria."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order and uses the appropriate form of the verb "correre" to agree with the singular subject "Sofia".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Andrea" is the one performing the action of smiling and "Sofia" is the recipient of that action, which is indicated by the verb "smiles." Additionally, the direct object marker "to" before "Sofia" shows that she is being smiled at.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. There are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors. "Beatrice" is the subject of the sentence and "bada" is the verb that agrees with it. The infinitive phrase "to be clear" acts as the direct object, which follows the normal word order for an English sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate tense for the action described. Here, "Alessandro" is the subject who is performing the action of "divorcing", hence "divorza". Similarly, "Paola" is the object of this action. Overall, there are no morphological, syntactical or semantic errors in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence "Riccardo abita in una casa piccola" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an Italian sentence and all words are used correctly according to their morphological agreement with respect to gender and number.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. It indicates that Maria is not currently located in Rome.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all words are used appropriately. "Stars" as the subject matches with its verb form "brillano", indicating that multiple stars are shining in the sky which is true when we look at the night sky.
0	Morphology	The phrase is not correct because it uses the wrong form of the verb "to look." It should be "This looks like..." instead of "This look like...", since the subject "this" is singular and requires the third person present tense singular form of the verb.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard English syntax rules for forming a simple sentence with a subject ("Leonardo"), an adverb ("intensely"), and a verb phrase ("studies three hours al day"). The phrasing "three hours al day" means "every day," which adds clarity to the sentence without changing its basic structure or meaning.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the verb "è" agrees with its subject "la parete", and the prepositional phrase "dalle spalle di Riccardo" correctly modifies the verb "toccata".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard structure of Subject-Verb-Object and each pronoun agrees with its corresponding verb in number. In this case, "Lorenzo" as the subject is singular and uses the third person singular form of the verb "tocca". Additionally, both proper nouns are clear in their function within the sentence making the meaning understandable without any ambiguity.
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because "derrive" is not a regular or irregular verb form in English. The correct form should be either "derive" or "derives", depending on the subject-verb agreement. In this case, since the subject of the sentence ("una") is singular, the correct form would be "derives".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "Gabriele" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "mangia." - "Poca" is an adjective that describes the noun "frutta," indicating a small amount. It agrees with its noun in gender (feminine) and number (singular). - "Frutta" is the direct object of the sentence and agrees with the verb in number (singular). So, overall, the sentence follows Italian morphological and syntactical rules and has no semantic errors.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the singular third person present tense verb "bebe" corresponds to the singular subject "Andrea".
0	Morphology	The sentence is not correct because the adverb "sadistically" should be used instead of "sadism." Sadism refers to deriving pleasure from inflicting pain on others, while sadly means feeling sorrow or regret. In this context, it seems that the intended meaning is for Francesco to pizzicato with an unpleasant or harsh attitude, so "sadistically" would be more appropriate than "sadism".
1	Correct	The sentence "Alessandro disegna sul muro" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of a simple Italian sentence and all words are used appropriately according to their morphological forms. In this case, "Alessandro" is the subject performing an action denoted by the verb "disegna", which agrees with its singular masculine form. Finally, "sul muro" indicates where such action takes place.
1	Correct	The sentence "Lorenzo balla la rumba." is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences and uses proper verb conjugations for each pronoun. In this case, "Lorenzo" is the subject, "balla" is the verb, and "la rumba" is the object. Additionally, "balla" is correctly conjugated to match the third person singular masculine form of the verb "dance".
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La siesta" means "the nap" or "siesta" in English and "è" is used as the third person singular form of the verb "to be," which agrees with the subject "la siesta." Additionally, "una" is an article that matches well with its noun. Therefore, this sentence structure follows standard Spanish language rules for morphology, syntax, and semantics.
1	Correct	The sentence "Francesco nuota a rana" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure and all of the words are used correctly in context. In this case, "Francesco" is the subject performing an action denoted by the verb "nuota," which means "swims." The prepositional phrase "a rana" tells us how Francesco swims - specifically, that he uses breaststroke swimming style. Therefore, there are no errors in morphology, syntax or semantics in this sentence.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "spunge" agrees with the verb "pulisce", and the meaning of the sentence is clear and coherent.
1	Correct	The sentence "Tutti bevono il the amaro" is grammatically correct. Although "the" should generally be capitalized as "The", it is not uncommon to see it written in lowercase in informal contexts. Additionally, "tea" is sometimes referred to as "the tea" in certain dialects or cultural contexts. However, if we assume that "the" is being used as an article rather than part of a proper noun or idiomatic expression, then it would need to be capitalized. Therefore, a more formal and strictly correct version of this sentence would be "Tutti bevono il tè amaro."
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct. The past participle "fatto" agrees with the subject "I works", and it correctly modifies the verb "have". Additionally, the adverb "more" is used appropriately to indicate an increase in width for the square.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because the subject "Tommaso" matches with the verb "afferra", which is conjugated correctly to agree with the singular third person subject. Additionally, the object of the preposition "il gatto" follows the preposition and agrees with the gender and number of the noun it refers to.
1	Correct	The sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb agreement and has a clear meaning. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence, while "riflette" is the verb that describes what he is doing, which is reflecting. Additionally, there is a prepositional phrase "sul gatto" providing more context about what or whom Alessandro is reflecting upon.
