label	explanation
0	The verb "voglio" (want) does not agree with its subject "I." Also, "di" should not be used before an infinitive; it should just be "salutare". A correct version could be "Voglio salutare Giulia" or "Io voglio salutare Giulia", both meaning "I want to greet Julia".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" is used with singular nouns while "Abbiamo" is used with plural nouns. In this case, "voglia" is a singular noun meaning desire or wish, so it takes "ho". Therefore, no correction needs to be made for grammatical accuracy.
0	In Italian, adjectives usually agree in gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural) with the noun they modify. In this case, "preferito" must match the gender and number of its associated noun "Divina Commedia," which requires it to be "la Divina Commedia" (feminine singular). However, since the subject "il mio" indicates that the preference belongs to the speaker, we need an additional word before "preferito." A better way to phrase the sentence would be "La mia preferita è la Divina Commedia" ("My favorite one is the Divine Comedy").
0	The sentence is incorrect because "treno" (train) is being confused with "opera" or "work of art". "La Divina Commedia" is Dante Alighieri's famous epic poem. If you want to say that it's your favorite train, use another word for expressing such as "Il mio treno preferito si chiama La Divina Commedia."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for expressing an action (in this case "ha parlato" = spoke) performed by one person ("Andrea") on another ("Riccardo"), as mediated through another party ("Lorenzo"). There are no apparent errors in verb tense or subject-verb agreement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" is the subject in third person singular form, so it pairs with the present continuous tense verb "sta elaborando".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" (masculine singular subject) matches with "ha incontrato" (third person singular verb form), and "Giulia" (feminine singular object) matches with "incontrato" (simple past tense for meeting one feminine singular object).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used here as a third-person singular verb form that agrees with the subject "il padre", which means "the father". The rest of the sentence, "ricomparso del ragazzo" translates to "reappeared of the boy" which could be improved for clarity but it does not make the whole sentence ungrammatical or unacceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I prezzi" means "the prices," which is plural, so it agrees with the verb "sono aumentati," meaning "have increased." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "The prices have increased" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Salvato" functions as an adjective agreeing with the subject "Andrea," describing him as having been saved or rescued. "Ci siamo dati alla pazza gioia" means "we gave ourselves over to reckless behavior." It may seem unusual for an English speaker, but it is perfectly fine in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il palazzo delle assicurazioni" means "the insurance company building," which is singular and masculine, so it correctly uses "è" (third person singular form) as an auxiliary verb before the past participle "crollato." Therefore, no correction is needed for this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quella" refers to a singular feminine noun which fits with "costruzione". Additionally, "offendere il buon gusto" is an idiomatic expression that means something is in bad taste or offensive. Therefore, I would say this sentence is acceptable as it is.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Newton" is the subject, which agrees with the third person singular verb form "ha spiegato". Additionally, "la forza di gravitá" (the force of gravity) is correctly gendered as feminine singular since "forza" is a feminine noun.
1	The sentence "She have been studying for hours." is grammatically correct in English, but it requires a singular subject or a correctly conjugated verb-subject agreement. A possible correction could be "She has been studying for hours" (if referring to one person) or "They have been studying for hours" (if referring to more than one person).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso si è danneggiato" can be translated as "Tommaso has damaged himself". The reflexive pronoun "si" is correctly used here with the verb "danneggiare" in its third person singular form ("è").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quegli uomini" (those men) is the subject, which agrees with the verb "hanno denunciato" (have denounced). The phrase "se stessi" refers back to "quegli uomini", indicating that they reported themselves. No grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
0	In this sentence, "compro" (I buy) does not agree with the subject "io e tu" (me and you), which is plural. It should be changed to "compriamo" for it to be grammatically correct. Additionally, in informal speech or writing, it is common to omit pronouns when they can easily be understood from context, so "Compro e leggi quel libro." would likely be more appropriate than including both "io" and "tu".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Ho incontrato Lorenzo, non Emma." can be translated as "I met Lorenzo, not Emma." which follows the structure of a simple Italian sentence with two coordinated clauses.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject and an auxiliary verb in the imperative form. A more complete version could be "Non **la** guardarlo" (Don't watch him), where "la" refers to a feminine direct object pronoun that agrees with the masculine singular direct object "him".
1	The sentence "Ich habe viele von Ricardos Freunden getroffen" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure for a German sentence with the subject first (in this case "ich"), followed by the verb (in this case "habe getroffen") and then the object ("viele von Ricardos Freunden"). Additionally, all words are spelled correctly and match their respective grammatical gender in German.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Non ho trovato il tuo libro in quella biblioteca" can be translated as "I did not find your book in that library". The subject of the sentence (the speaker) is using a singular verb form ("ho trovato") which agrees with their singular identity. Additionally, the definite article "il" correctly precedes "tuo libro", indicating it is singular. All other elements within the sentence follow standard Italian grammar rules for word order, tense agreement, and so forth.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Non ce ne ho trovati molti" can be translated as "I haven't found many of them." Here, "ce" refers to something previously mentioned or understood from context; "ne" indicates some quantity of that thing; "ho trovati" means "have I found"; and "molti" stands for "many". So, overall it forms a proper Italian sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject that promises something to "Maria". He will sell his own house as stated by "la propria casa".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is a singular feminine subject, and "ha salutato" (third person singular form of "salutare") agrees with it. "I suoi genitori" (her parents) is the object of the verb "salutare."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is a third-person singular masculine noun in Italian, so it requires the use of "è," which is the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "essere" (to be). Therefore, "Riccardo non è molto intelligente" means "Riccardo is not very smart."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo non è molto, credo, intelligente" can be translated as "Riccardo isn't very, I think, intelligent." There is no grammatical error in this sentence; however, it contains some colloquial elements such as the use of "credo," which expresses uncertainty or personal opinion.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Many people called that number." Here's why it's right: - "Hanno" (third person plural) agrees with the subject "molte persone" (many people). - "Chiamato" (past participle) agrees in gender and number with the direct object "quel numero" (that number), as required by past participle agreement rules in Italian.
1	The sentence "Che cosa ha comprato Riccardo?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "What did Riccardo buy?" in English. Here, "che cosa" is an interrogative expression used for asking questions about things or objects. "Ha comprato" is the third person singular form (he/she/it) of the present perfect tense of the verb "comprare", which means "to buy". And finally, "Riccardo" is the subject of the question.
0	In the given sentence "Andrea è stato incontrato da Leonardo," the grammatical error lies with the passive voice usage which implies that "Andrea" was acted upon by "Leonardo". However, since both names are proper nouns referring to individuals (not groups), using the passive voice can lead to confusion regarding who actually performed the action. It would have been more appropriate to use active voice ("Leonardo ha incontrato Andrea") or include multiple people as recipients of the action in order for passive voice to make sense ("Andrea ed altri sono stati incontrati da Leonardo").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Riccardo" (subject) is correctly conjugated as third person singular present tense of "ha domandato". * "da chi" is a correct way to ask "by whom." * "non era stato visto" follows the rules for past participle agreement with "Leonardo," which agrees in gender and number. Since "Leonardo" is masculine singular, "era stato" must also agree, so it is "stato" rather than "state" or some other form. * Therefore, overall, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo, mi han detto che parlerà domani" can be translated as "Leonardo, they told me he will speak tomorrow." It follows the standard structure for future tense in Italian with "parlare" being the verb that indicates speaking, "-à" indicating he (third person singular) will do an action, and "domani" meaning tomorrow.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Gabriele, when did you see him?" in English. In Italian, questions can be formed by simply changing intonation at the end of the sentence or adding a question mark at the end (if written). No other changes need to be made to convert it into a question form.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "In which drawer did Leonardo put the papers?" The word order and grammatical structure follow the rules of standard Italian.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Quali politici hanno parlato?" in order to agree with the plural subject "politici."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect due to multiple issues with subject-verb agreement and pronoun reference. Specifically, "il giudice" (the judge) does not agree in gender or number with its corresponding verb "ha parlato" (has spoken). Additionally, the relative pronoun "che" is repeated unnecessarily, causing confusion. A corrected version could be "Quale politico ha detto la radio che il giudice ha dichiarato aver parlato?" which means "Which politician did the radio say that the judge declared had spoken?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject, "ha detto" (third person singular of "avere", meaning "has said") indicates that he took an action in the past, "che" introduces a subordinate clause, "partirà" (third person singular of "partire", meaning "will leave") is the verb in the subjunctive mood in the future tense indicating uncertainty about when or even if it will happen, and "domani" means "tomorrow". So, the whole sentence can be translated as "Lorenzo said that he would leave tomorrow."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Quando è arrivato Francesco, abbiamo potuto cenare" translates to "When Francesco arrived, we were able to have dinner." In Italian, when using the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have) in compound tenses such as the passato prossimo (past perfect), the past participle agrees with the subject in gender and number. However, since the subject here is "noi" (we), which is already plural, the masculine singular form of the past participle ("arrivato") can be used after the auxiliary verb "è". Therefore, the use of "è arrivato" followed by "abbiamo potuto cenare" forms a grammatically correct sequence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La tempesta" (the storm) is the subject and it agrees with the verb "ha abbattuto" (has knocked down). Also, all other words in the sentence correctly agree in number and gender.
0	The sentence "Chi tocca i fili muore" is incorrect in standard Italian. A more accurate translation of the English idiomatic expression "he who touches something dies" into Italian would be "chi tocca (quel qualcosa) muore". However, even with this correction, the sentence could still sound awkward or not make sense without additional context as to what specifically "that thing" refers to that touching it results in death.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Che" is used as a relative pronoun connecting the clause "che è venuto a trovarmi ieri" (who came to visit me yesterday) with its antecedent "Alessandro". The verb form "è" agrees with the singular subject "Alessandro", and the present tense "ha detto" matches the past time reference in the first part of the sentence ("venuto").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La commissione" is a feminine singular noun that requires the use of "ritiene", which agrees with it in gender and number. Additionally, "il candidato" is a masculine singular noun requiring the agreement in gender and number from the adjective phrase "aver fornito sufficienti prove". All other elements in the sentence show grammatical consistency as well.
1	The sentence "Il timore della guerra è ingiustificato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The fear of war is unjustified." In this sentence, "il timore" (fear) is the subject, which agrees with the singular conjugated verb "è" (is). Additionally, "della guerra" (of war) is a prepositional phrase that modifies the subject.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject and it agrees with the verb form "ha perso", which means "has lost". The object of the sentence is "le chiavi", meaning "the keys".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Bramare" means to strongly desire or covet something, so "Alessandro è bramoso di potere" can be translated as "Alessandro eagerly desires (to have) power". There is no grammatical mistake in it.
0	In the given sentence "Penso che Francesco domandi l'ora a Lorenzo," the verb form used for "Francesco" does not match with the subject. Since "penso" (I think) implies that the speaker is singular, the corresponding verb conjugation for "Francesco" should also be in third person singular form. However, "domandi" is second person singular, which suggests addressing someone directly as "you." Therefore, it results in an inconsistency between the subject and its verb. A corrected version would be "Penso che Francesco domanda l'ora a Lorenzo."
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha affermato che Edoardo parla." is grammatically correct. It means "Tommaso has stated that Edoardo speaks." In this sentence, the verb "ha affermato" agrees with the subject "Tommaso," while the verb "parla" agrees with its own singular subject "Edoardo." Both verbs are in their proper conjugated forms according to the grammatical rules of Italian language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Avendo" is used as a gerund here, introducing a subordinate clause that indicates anteriority with respect to the main verb "dovrò". Both tenses are in past simple, which is appropriate given the meaning of the sentence (Maria and Jane have always maintained a different position, so they will have to vote against the proposal).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) is using the third person singular form of the verb "ha ordinato" (has ordered), which agrees with the subject in number and gender. Similarly, "Andrea" (indirect object) and "difenderlo" (to defend him) also agree in number and gender. Overall, the syntax and agreement between words make this sentence acceptable.
1	The sentence "Il fatto di essere stato scoperto un delitto ci ha sconvolti." is grammatically correct. Although it might seem that "un" (a/an) does not agree with "delitto" (crime), in Italian sometimes an article can refer to something previously mentioned or understood from context. In this case, "un delitto" refers to "the fact of having discovered a crime", which was already stated beforehand. So, even though the wording may appear unusual at first glance, the use of the indefinite article here is indeed acceptable in Italian grammar when used appropriately within a given context.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks agreement between its subject "Alessandro" (third person singular masculine) and verb "pensi" (second person singular). It should be "Chi **pensa** che Alessandro incontrerà?" for grammatical correctness.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La sedia" means "the chair", "su cui" means "on which", "ti sei seduto" is the past tense form of "you have sat", and "è rotta" means "is broken". So the entire sentence translates to "The chair on which you have sat is broken."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Questa" refers to "the person", "con cui" means "with whom", "Edoardo" is the subject who made the statement, "che" introduces a relative clause, "Tommaso" is the subject who spoke. Therefore, the entire sentence can be interpreted as "This is the person with whom Edoardo made the statement that Tommaso spoke."
0	In Italian, when using "chi" (who or whom) as a relative pronoun, it must introduce a finite subordinate clause where the verb agrees in number with the subject of that clause. Here, the subject of the subordinate clause is "Sofia," which is singular feminine; therefore, the verb "ha baciato" should agree in person, number, and gender with its subject "Sofia." Instead, we have "abbià", which does not match either the person or number of "Sofia". Therefore, the correction would be: Edoardo crede che Sofia abbia baciato.
0	The sentence contains an error in word order after the verb "sapere". In questions, the subject follows the conjugated form of the verb. Therefore, it should be "Che problema non sappiamo noi come potremo risolvere?" or more simply "Come potremo risolvere questo problema?"
1	The sentence "Abbia visto lui." is grammatically correct in Italian. Even though "lui" (he) is masculine singular, it can still follow a verb that agrees with its subject in number and gender. In this case, "abbia visto" (has seen) is third person singular, so it matches "lui".
0	The sentence is incorrect because "lo" (which means "him" or "it") does not agree in gender or number with its antecedent, which appears to be "we" ("Abbiamo"). A correction could be made by replacing "lo" with "ci", resulting in "Abbiamo visto ci." This would mean "We have seen us," but it at least agrees in gender and number with its antecedent.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sofia says that Alessandro will speak tomorrow." Each word is spelled correctly, it follows subject-verb agreement rules (dice is third person singular), and the verb tense for the future action ("parlerà") matches with the time frame specified by the speaker.
0	In this sentence, "mi" is incorrectly used as an indirect object pronoun. It should be replaced with "le," which is the appropriate indirect object pronoun for "se stessa." Also, "ha mi avuto" should be changed to "mi sono avuta" to agree in gender and number with "se stessa." So the corrected form would be: "Beatrice ha dichiarato che se stessa non si è mai avuta niente a che fare con Gabriele."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (masculine singular) said that "Andrea" (masculine singular) looked at himself ("si è guardato").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Andrea's father seemed very happy when I spoke with him." All the verb conjugations match their respective subjects in number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine). Additionally, all endings on nouns, pronouns, and articles agree with the gender and number of those words.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the structure of a complex sentence with multiple embedded clauses (also called subordinate clauses). Each clause has its own subject-verb agreement, which in Italian depends on the number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine) of the subject. In this case, each verb agrees with its respective subject within each clause. Let me break it down for you: 1. "Penso" - I think 2. "che Edoardo" - that Eduardo 3. "creda" - believes (third person singular masculine) 4. "che Maria" - that Maria 5. "voglia" - wants (third person singular feminine) 6. "che Gabriele" - that Gabriele 7. "veda" - sees (third person singular masculine) 8. "Riccardo." - Riccardo. The whole sentence can be translated as: "I think that Eduardo believes that Maria wants that Gabriele sees Riccardo," where each part corresponds correctly to its grammatical form. So, overall, the given sentence is grammatically correct!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: "Edoardo" (subject) believes that "Emma" (direct object) wants that "Tommaso" (subject) sees "Gabriele" (indirect object). Each verb agrees with its subject in number and person, making it grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Il coniglio mangia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The rabbit eats" or "The rabbit is eating". Even though it might seem odd that the sentence does not have an object (the thing being eaten), it could still be a complete sentence with proper context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Which book does he say the professor recommended reading?" In Italian, sometimes object pronouns (in this case, "che" referring to "libro") come before the verb they refer to ("dice"), which might seem unusual for English speakers but it is perfectly acceptable in Italian.
0	The sentence "Per primo sono arrivato me, non tu." is incorrect because the verb "essere" (to be) must agree in number with its subject. In this case, the subject "me" is singular, but the form of the verb used ("sono") is for first person plural. It should be "Sono arrivato io, non tu." which means "I arrived first, not you".
1	The sentence "Arriva un uomo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A man arrives.", where "un uomo" (a man) is the subject of the sentence and "arriva" (arrives) is its verb in third person singular present tense form.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo killed Andrea" in English. The subject (Leonardo) agrees with the verb (uccise) in number and gender. In this case, both the subject and the verb are masculine singular.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, the verb "ha" (third person singular form of "avere", meaning "has") agrees with its subject "Andrea". Also, the pronoun "lo" correctly refers back to a masculine direct object earlier mentioned in the conversation ("Tommaso"). Therefore, I would say that this sentence is acceptable as it stands.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject, "ha" is the auxiliary verb indicating present tense, first person singular, and "voglia" indicates desire or wish. Therefore, the sentence translates to "Gabriele wants to go to the sea."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used here as a support verb for the past participle "letto". It agrees with the subject-verb agreement rules in Italian, where "è" is used with singular masculine nouns, while "questo" refers to a singular neuter noun (libro). Therefore, it is appropriate in this context.
1	The sentence "Da quel professore, Tommaso non è stato ancora interrogato?" is grammatically correct. This question translates to "Hasn't Thomas been questioned by that teacher yet?" in English. The sentence structure follows standard Italian syntax rules with proper verb conjugations.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" (subject) believes that "invaderemo" (future tense of "we will invade") that country. All words agree in number and tense, making it a proper Italian sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "A proposito di questi paesi, quale crede Andrea che invaderanno?" can be translated as "Speaking of these countries, which does Andrea believe will invade?" in English. It follows the standard structure for forming questions in Italian by using the verb before the subject when asking a question.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Last year, Alessandro was writing a book, but he still hasn't finished it today." The use of "scrisseva" (past imperfect) in the first clause indicates that Alessandro's action of writing the book took place repeatedly or continuously in the past, while "non l'ha ancora finito" (has not yet finished it) in the second clause shows that the action is still ongoing until now.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Last year, Edoardo wrote a book, but so far he hasn't finished it yet." The verb conjugations match their respective subjects in number and tense, making the sentence grammatically sound.
0	The sentence "Gabriele è scapolo ed è sposato" is grammatically incorrect because it states that one person (Gabriele) is both single ("scapolo") and married ("sposato"), which is contradictory. Each subject must have consistent attributes; therefore, the correct way to express this idea would be "Gabriele è scapolo e Marco è sposato," assuming another individual named Marco exists who is married.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "L'attuale re di Francia" means "the current king of France," which is singular and masculine. Since "è" agrees in number and gender with "re", it is also correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Qualche" means "some", "studente" means "student", "ha" is the third person singular form of the verb "avere" (to have), which agrees with the singular subject "qualche studente". Finally, "l'esame" means "the exam". So, overall, it translates to "Some student passed the exam."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It can be translated as "If any student hasn't passed the exam, then no student has passed the exam." Both parts of the conditional sentence use the negative form correctly (non ha superato).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ieri" means "yesterday", "ho promesso" is the first person singular present tense of "promettere" (to promise), "a" is used as "to" here, "Lorenzo" is the indirect object, and "di partire" is an infinitive phrase acting as the direct object of the sentence, which means "to leave". So, the whole sentence can be translated into English as "Yesterday, I promised Lorenzo to leave."
1	The sentence "Nel processo di primo grado, la corte dichiarò l'imputato innocente." is grammatically correct. It means "In the first degree trial, the court declared the defendant innocent." There is no grammatical error in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Continua" which means "continue", agrees with its subject (implied as "you"). "Così" which means "like this" or "this way" is correctly placed after the verb. "E" which means "and" connects two words together, indicating that by continuing this way, something bad will happen - hence, "combinerai guai" which translates to "you will cause trouble".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular form of the present tense verb "avere" (to have), which agrees with the subject pronoun "I." "Preso" is the past participle that agrees with the direct object "le chiavi," meaning "the keys." Therefore, the sentence translates as "I took the keys" in English.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Andrea, trasmettendoci le commissioni della marchesa" - This clause is introducing the action being performed by Andrea, which is transmitting something (presumably messages or tasks) from the marchioness. * "Ha detto" indicates that Andrea is conveying a message or quote from someone else, in this case, the marchioness. * "Darete loro il buongiorno" is a subjunctive form used here appropriately since it refers to an uncertain event in the future ("you will give them good morning"). It is also consistent with the formal register required when addressing multiple people as "lei."
0	The sentence "Una bella casa fa comodo" is grammatically incorrect in Italian. The error lies in the subject-verb agreement. The subject "una bella casa" (a beautiful house) is feminine singular, while "fa" (does) is third person singular present indicative, which does not match with the intended meaning. Instead, it seems that you want to say something along the lines of "It is comfortable to have a nice home." In such cases, one would use "è comodo," where "è" agrees with both the gender and number of "comodo". Therefore, a more appropriate way to express this idea could be "È comodo avere una bella casa" or simply "Avere una bella casa è comodo."
1	The sentence "Prendiamo questo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "We take this". "Prendiamo" is the first person plural present indicative form of the verb "prendere", which means "to take", and "questo" is an adjective that means "this".
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "il" (masculine singular) before "gladio" which is also masculine singular. However, since "uso" is first person singular, the subject of the sentence needs to be in agreement with that form. Therefore, either the subject or the article need to change for the sentence to be grammatically correct. For instance, one could say "Io uso la spada," where "spada" is feminine singular, so "la" is used as its corresponding definite article. Or one could keep "gladio" but use the third-person singular verb form, such as "Lui usa il gladio."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il calcolatore" means "the calculator," and "funziona bene" means "works well." So, when combined, "Il calcolatore funziona bene" translates to "The calculator works well."
0	In standard English grammar, we use "doesn't" instead of "don't" with singular third-person pronouns such as "she," so the correct form would be "She doesn't want to come."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect due to the use of "don't" instead of "doesn't" with the singular third-person subject "she," as well as the lack of an apostrophe in "likes." A correct version could be "She doesn't like to eat vegetables."
1	The sentence "Il libro che mi ha prestato Lorenzo non mi piace." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "The book that Lorenzo lent me, I don't like it" which follows proper subject-verb agreement rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, direct object pronouns (such as "che" in this case) can come before or after an infinitive verb that follows another verb. Therefore, both "dicono che hai raccontato che non ci vediamo mai" and "dicono che non ci vediamo mai che hai raccontato" would be acceptable ways to phrase this sentence, although the former is more commonly used.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Legge" means "reads" in English, so it agrees with its subject "Maria." Even though multiple people are mentioned, only one person (Maria) is doing the action described by the verb. Therefore, no changes need to be made for grammatical agreement between subject and verb.
1	The sentence "Andando a casa, ho incontrato tuo fratello." is grammatically correct. It means "On my way home, I met your brother." However, it would be more natural to include the subject pronoun "io" (I) for clarity, especially since there are two people mentioned later in the sentence ("tuo fratello," or "your brother"). A more complete version might read: "Io, andando a casa, ho incontrato tuo fratello."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sto" is used here as an auxiliary verb that means "I am", while "andando" is its gerund form which means "going". Together they indicate progressive tense. Then we have "a prendere" which means "to pick up", where "a" is a preposition meaning "to" or "at" and "prendere" is the infinitive form of the verb "take". Finally, "la macchina" simply translates to "the car". Therefore, when combined, the entire sentence means "I am going to pick up the car."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Non è vero che" is used correctly as a negation phrase followed by the subjunctive form "cambiasse", which agrees with the subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. Additionally, the comparison between places ("luoghi") and men's faces ("volto degli uomini") is also appropriate.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and an appropriate verb conjugation for that subject. Additionally, "va'" does not seem to correspond to any standard Italian verb form I am familiar with. A more complete and grammatical version could be something like "Vai a casa!" (which means "Go home" in English), assuming we want to address a singular subject in informal language.
0	The sentence "Io sono affamato" is incorrect because "io" (I) as a subject requires the verb conjugated in first person singular form, but "sono affamato" is third person singular (he/she/it is hungry). A correct version would be "Sono affamato".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Bravo" can function as an exclamation on its own in Italian, equivalent to saying "Good job!" or "Well done!" in English. The subject of the sentence is implied to be masculine singular ("this boy"), which matches with "bravo".
1	The sentence "Paola è una donna che apprezziamo molto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola is a woman we appreciate very much". The subject-verb agreement is correct since "è" (is) agrees with the singular feminine noun "donna", while the verb form "appreazziamo" correctly matches the first person plural subject "noi". Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "What are you doing tomorrow?" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho letto il giornale che hai comprato" translates to "I read the newspaper that you bought." In this sentence, the subject "io" (I) is implied and does not need to be explicitly stated, as it is understood from the verb conjugation "ho letto" (have read). Additionally, all other words and grammar rules follow standard Italian language conventions.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gli" is used as a plural masculine definite article (meaning "the") for nouns that start with a vowel or stresses on the penultimate syllable. Here it agrees in number and gender with "amici". Then we have two relative pronouns "il cui", which means "whose", referring back to "gli amici". Finally, we have "maestro" meaning "teacher" followed by "è" (third person singular form of "to be") and "Andrea". So overall, the sentence translates to "The friends whose teacher is Andrea."
1	The sentence "Credo che tu abbia ragione" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I believe you are right." In this sentence, "tu" (you) is the subject, and "abbi" is the second person singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere," which agrees with the subject "tu." Therefore, the sentence is acceptable as it stands.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Siccome" means "because", "è caduto" is the third person singular masculine past tense form of the verb "cadere" (to fall), and "si è fatto male" is the reflexive phrase meaning "he hurt himself". So the whole sentence translates as "Because he fell, he hurt himself."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "They wanted to destroy her and they destroyed her." The auxiliary verb "hanno" agrees with the plural subject "they", and the past participle "distrutta" also agrees with its feminine gender.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ognuno" means "each one", so it requires the singular form "suo". It translates to "Each one takes his own coat." If you wanted to refer to multiple people using gender-neutral language, you could say "Ogni persona prenda la sua giacca.", which would mean "Every person takes their own jacket."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Prendimi" means "take me", "quell'aggeggio" means "that gadget". It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "prendere" changes form based on who is taking (in this case, I am).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in order. "Il cane ha morso la ragazza" translates to "The dog bit the girl". Both "il cane" (the dog) and "la ragazza" (the girl) are correctly gendered and agree with their respective articles.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria uses the computer, I don't know how to do it." Here, "Maria" (singular subject) takes "usa", while "io" (another singular subject) takes "so". Both verbs agree with their respective subjects in number and tense.
1	The sentence "Ho visto una casa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I saw a house" in English. The subject-verb agreement is correct as "ho" (first person singular of present perfect tense) matches with the singular noun "casa". Also, article "una" agrees with the singular noun. Therefore, it's a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular form of the verb "avere" (to have), which agrees with the subject "I". "Visto" is the past participle of the verb "vedere" (to see) and it agrees with the direct object "tua madre" through the use of auxiliary verb "ho". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The person who spoke to me" in English. Here's why it's correct: - "La persona" is singular feminine noun meaning "the person." - "che" is a relative pronoun introducing a subordinate clause that refers back to the antecedent "la persona". - "mi" is an indirect object pronoun referring to the speaker. - "ha parlato" is the third-person singular verb form for the past tense of "parlare", which means "to speak". Since the gender of the speaker is not specified, we can assume that the sentence is from a female speaker or it is just generic.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Se uno va in treno, vuole stare comodo" can be translated as "If one goes by train, they want to be comfortable." In Italian, it is common to use the singular form for impersonal or general statements even when referring to multiple people or things, which seems to be the case here.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a proper verb conjugation that agrees with the subject "la mia testa" (my head). In Italian, when referring to body parts in first person singular, we use the reflexive pronoun mi + verb in third person singular form. Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be "Mi fa male la testa."
0	The sentence "Ho due case" is incorrect in Italian because it uses the wrong form of the verb "avere" (to have) for the subject. In this case, since the subject ("io", or I) is understood but not explicitly stated, we still need to use the first person singular form of the verb, which is "ho". However, "due case" means "two houses," so the correct sentence would require the plural form of the verb "avere", which is "abbiamo". Therefore, the corrected sentence should read as follows: "Abbiamo due case."
0	The verb "ho" (I have) does not agree with the subject "le ragazze" (the girls). It should be "hanno" (they have), since it is a third person plural form. Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be "Le ragazze hanno delle case."
1	The sentence "Il cavallo è arrivato prima." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The horse arrived first". Here, "il cavallo" (the horse) is the subject of the sentence and "è arrivato" (has arrived) is its verb tense in third person singular form. Since we have only one horse as the subject here, using "é" instead of "sono" or other plural forms is appropriate. Also, "prima" can function both as an adverb meaning "first", which fits well with our context and it could also mean "before" but that would require additional words for clarification. Overall, the given sentence follows all grammatical rules correctly.
1	The sentence "I cavalli sono animali resistenti" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The horses are strong animals." In this sentence, the subject "cavalli" (horses) agrees with the verb "sono" (are). Therefore, it's grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "È venuto" means "has come" in English and it agrees with the gender (masculine) and singular number of an unspecified subject. Since we don't know who came, the subject remains generic and does not need to match any specific person or thing.
0	The sentence "È arrivato." is incorrect because it uses the singular masculine form of the verb "arrivare" (to arrive), but no subject is specified in the sentence or implied from context that would agree with this form. A grammatically correct version could use the third-person singular masculine pronoun "egli" as its subject ("Egli è arrivato.") or simply state who arrived using another noun or pronoun beforehand.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Posso" means "I can" and "venire" means "to come". Therefore, the sentence "Posso venire" translates to "I can come", which makes sense and follows all necessary grammar rules for the language.
0	The sentence "Magari domani piove" is not grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to something like "Maybe tomorrow rains," which doesn't make sense in English or Italian. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "Magari piovesse domani" (If only it were going to rain tomorrow).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Lui" means "he", "è stato" is the auxiliary verb for the passive voice in past tense, and "colto" is the past participle form of the verb "cogliere". So, the sentence can be translated as "He was caught by the rain."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Write a letter to his aunt." In Italian, possessive adjectives (such as "sua" meaning "his") must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify, but in this case, the gender and number are not specified for the noun "zia", so it is acceptable to use "sua".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Egli" (he) is the subject and "lo" (it/him) is the direct object. So the sentence means "He saw him."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (subject) promises ("promette") to "Edoardo" that he will stay ("di restare") at home ("a casa").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo non ha tempo" can be translated as "Riccardo doesn't have time." In Italian, "non" is used with the present tense form of the verb (in this case, "ha") to indicate negation. So the sentence structure follows standard Italian grammar rules for forming negative sentences in the present tense.
1	The sentence "Ho riparato il tavolo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I fixed the table" in English. In this sentence, "ho" is the first person singular form of the present tense of the verb "avere" (to have), which is used as an auxiliary verb for compound past tenses; "riparato" is the past participle of the verb "riparare" (to fix); "il" is the definite article for masculine singular nouns, and "tavolo" is the word for "table". Therefore, overall, the structure of the sentence follows standard subject-verb-object order, making it grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Hanno" is the third person plural form of the verb "aprire," which means "to open." It agrees with the subject "le ragazze," indicating that more than one girl opened the book.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le" refers to "gli/a sono state date," which means "they were given." It agrees with the plural female subject (Masha and Jane). The rest of the sentence follows normal grammar rules for word order and verb conjugations.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "That boy opens the door." In Italian, when referring to a generic or unspecified male person, you can use "quello" (for singular) or "quegli" (for plural). However, for masculine singular nouns, including pronouns such as "ragazzo," it's more common to use "quel" rather than "quello". So, "Quel ragazzo" is perfectly acceptable and idiomatic.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular present tense of the verb "avere," meaning "to have." "Sentito" is the past participle form of the verb "sentire," meaning "to hear." "Cantare" means "to sing," and "i ragazzi" means "the boys." So the entire sentence translates to "I heard the boys singing" in English.
0	In Italian, reflexive verbs require that the subject and object pronouns agree in number (singular or plural). In this case, "la" (third person singular feminine) does not match with "loro" (plural third person masculine or mixed gender), so the sentence is ungrammatical. A correct version would be "La macchina vuole lavarle loro."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" (third person singular form of the verb "essere", meaning "to be") agrees with its subject "il meccanico" (the mechanic). Therefore, no correction is needed for this sentence.
0	The verb "venire" agrees with the subject in number and person. In this case, since the subject ("io") is singular, the verb form should also be singular. Therefore, it should be "vengo" (I am coming) instead of "venire". Also, "fino a Napoli" is an adverbial phrase that should not interrupt the infinitive verb phrase "venire a Napoli", so the correct sentence would be: "Non voglio venire a Napoli."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks proper context regarding the subject or action. "Quanto al bagno" translates to "As for the bathroom," but there needs to be an accompanying statement about the bathroom that follows. For example, a complete sentence could be "Quanto al bagno, è pulito?" which means "As for the bathroom, is it clean?"
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct in standard Italian. "Hai presente" means "Do you remember?" and "Lorenzo" is being used as the object here. This construction is similar to asking "Do you remember John?" in English, where "John" follows the verb "remember." So no grammatical error is detected in this sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a proper subject and auxiliary verb. A possible correction could be "Lei da quand'è che vive negli Stati Uniti?" which translates to "Has she been living in the United States since when?" (with an implied question mark).
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. "Credi" (you believe) agrees with its subject, which is implied but not explicitly stated in the question. The rest of the sentence also follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Appena detto ciò" means "as soon as I said that". "Mi lasciò" means "he left me", with "mi" being a reflexive pronoun in the accusative case indicating the action was performed on or for the speaker. "Che" introduces a relative clause. "Piangevo" is the imperfect indicative form of "piangere," meaning "to cry." Therefore, the translation would be something like "As soon as I said that, he left me while I cried and wanted to say many things."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sei" is the second person singular informal form of the verb "essere", which means "to be". It agrees with the subject "tu" (you). So, it's appropriate here as it refers to one person. "sempre lo stesso" means always the same, while "un amico fidato, paziente e onesto" describes the qualities of that friend - loyal, patient, and honest.
1	The sentence "Il vento forte sul mare può provocare mareggiate." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A strong wind over the sea can cause storms at sea". All words are used correctly, and their form matches with its intended grammatical function.
0	The sentence "Piangere forte." is incomplete and lacks a clear subject, which makes it ungrammatical in Italian. In addition, the verb form used here ("piangere") doesn't match any specific tense or person agreement. Therefore, additional context or information would be needed to make this sentence complete and grammatical.
1	The sentence "Ho preso in casa una specie di gatto." is grammatically correct. It means "I took home a kind of cat" or more naturally "I brought home a type of cat". There doesn't seem to be any grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Ho preso" (I took) agrees with the subject "io" which is understood in the sentence but not explicitly stated. Therefore, it does not contradict any grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Non" means "not", "mi" shows that the subject likes something but not mentioned yet (indirect object), "piace" stands for "likes" or "pleases," and "il vino" means "the wine." Therefore, the whole sentence translates as "I don't like the wine" which makes sense and follows all grammatical rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quel che" means "what", "vendo" is the first person singular present tense form of the verb " vendere" which means "to sell". So, "Quel che vendo" translates as "What I sell", and "è merce cinese" means "is Chinese goods". Therefore, the entire sentence can be translated as "What I sell is Chinese merchandise."
0	The sentence is incomplete and contains a dangling participle "mettere" which means "to put" in English. A complete sentence requires both a subject and a predicate. In addition, there seems to miss a direct object for the verb "mettere".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "È" is used here as a third person singular verb form in present tense which agrees with its subject "concorso". It means "A competition was banned."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tutte" means "all," "le balene" refers to "the whales," and "devono essere protette" translates to "must be protected." So, the entire sentence can be translated as "All whales must be protected," which makes sense both semantically and grammatically.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Mettitelo" means "put it on" or "put it inside" in English, while "bene" means "well," so together they mean something along the lines of "put it on well." "In capo" translates to "on (one's) head," but since we don't have an object being placed directly on someone's head here, I assume that "in capo" functions more as an adverbial phrase meaning "carefully" in this context. So, overall, the translation would be something like "Put it on carefully."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect in Italian. It seems that there was an attempt to say "This machine is old but new," but the adjectives do not agree with the subject or each other. In Italian, when using "this" (questa) as the subject, the adjective must also be feminine singular; however, both "vecchio" (old) and "nuovo" (new) have masculine forms here. To fix it, one could say "Questa macchina è vecchia ma nuova" for "This machine is old but new."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" is the subject and "non conosce Maria" means "does not know Mary". So the whole sentence translates as "Leonardo does not know Mary", which is perfectly fine in English too.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il" refers to a singular masculine noun and agrees with "governo", which means government. "Ha" is an auxiliary verb used for third person singular (masculine or feminine) simple past tense and it also agrees with "governo". "Abolito" is the past participle form of the verb "abolire", meaning to abolish, that matches gender and number agreement with its subject "governo". Finally, "la legge" translates as "the law", where "la" again corresponds to a singular feminine noun. Therefore, all grammatical components match appropriately making this sentence grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lo" is the correct form for masculine singular direct object pronoun, which refers back to "il libro" (the book).
1	The sentence "Tommaso abita da dieci anni" is grammatically correct. This means that Tommaso has been living somewhere for ten years. There is no grammatical error in the sentence as it follows all the rules of Italian language syntax and verb conjugations.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) is using the third-person singular form of the verb "ha dato" (has given), which agrees with the direct object "un libro" (a book). He gave "a book" to "Sofia", so no changes needed for grammatical agreement or tense.
1	The sentence "Maria ha corso per ore" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria ran for hours." In Italian, the present perfect tense (passato prossimo) consists of two parts: an auxiliary verb (avere or essere) followed by the past participle of the main verb. Here, the auxiliary verb "ha" agrees with its singular subject "Maria," making it grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (masculine singular) matches with "ha bevuto" (third person singular), which means "has drunk." "Un caffè" (a coffee) refers to one cup of coffee that was consumed by the subject. So the overall structure of the sentence indicates past tense action performed by a single male individual on a specific object, hence it makes sense and can be considered as acceptable or grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is a third-person singular subject which requires the use of "ha" (present tense of verb "avere") for past tense action indicating that one person performed an action of finding something. In this case, it refers to Andrea who found a theater ticket ("un biglietto per l'opera").
1	The sentence "Edoardo sta compilando" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo is filling out (something)". Here, "sta" is an auxiliary verb used with the gerund form "-ndo", which together express continuous or progressive aspect; while "compilando" is the present participle of the verb "compilare" meaning "to fill out". Hence, no correction needed here.
0	The sentence is incomplete and lacks proper verb conjugation. A possible correction could be "Emana profumo" (which means "(She) emits fragrance"), but it would still only refer to one person, while "Emanano profumo" ("They emit fragrance") would be appropriate for multiple people or entities.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "To open a new store." In Italian, subject pronouns are often omitted when they can be inferred from context or verb ending, which is why there is no explicit subject here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "To start an activity."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La porta" means "the door", while "si è chiusa" is the third person singular indicative form of the verb "chiudere", meaning "to close". Therefore, "la porta si è chiusa" can be translated as "the door has closed".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is the subject and "non ammette" means "does not admit". "Di essere preso in giro" can be translated as "of being made fun of", which serves as an infinitive complement of the verb "ammettere" (to admit). Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is a singular third-person feminine subject which matches with the verb form "ha", which is also third-person singular (present tense). The direct object is "il libro," which agrees with the masculine gender and singular number of "libro."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Che cosa" means "what thing," which functions as an interrogative pronoun here, asking about what was taken. The verb "ha preso" (third person singular form) agrees with the subject "uno studente" (one student), making it grammatically consistent throughout the question.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le" is used as an article before feminine singular nouns starting with a stressed vowel (scarpe = shoe/shoes - feminine singular). Also, "si sono macchiate" follows the rule for reflexive verbs where "si" changes to agree with the subject "le scarpe."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le" is used as an article before feminine singular nouns starting with a stressed vowel (like "giornata"). Also, "si" here refers to the reflexive subject which means "they". Therefore, "le giornate si sono accorciate" translates to "the days have shortened", which is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Qualcosa" (something) is the subject of the sentence, and it agrees with the verb "ha accorciato" (has shortened). The object of the sentence is "le giornate" (the days), which is correctly plural and feminine to agree with "giornate". Therefore, I would say that overall, the syntax and agreement between words make this an acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Qualcuno" means "someone", "ha" is the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "to have", "accorciato" is the past participle of the verb "to shorten", "le" is the feminine plural definite article, and "giornate" means "days". So overall, the sentence means "Someone has shortened the days."
0	This sentence is incomplete and lacks proper context for evaluation of its grammaticality. It appears to be an Italian phrase "Aggrapparsi a un ramo" which translates to "Clinging to a branch." However, without more information or context about who is clinging to the branch, it cannot be definitively classified as grammatically correct or not.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Arenatesi" means "ran aground", while "le navi" refers to "the ships". "Gli equipaggi" translates to "the crews" and "sono scesi a terra" means "have disembarked on land". So, overall, the translation would be something like: "The ships ran aground, the crews have disembarked on land."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La nebbia" means "the fog" in English, which is feminine singular in Italian. "È" is the third person singular form of the verb "to be," which agrees with "la nebbia." Therefore, the sentence "La nebbia è svanita" translates to "The fog has vanished" or "The fog disappeared" in English.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "si" should not be used with "sempre." Instead, use "loro" as the reflexive pronoun for third-person plural subjects like "Alessandro." A correct version would be "Alessandro si pianto sempre." However, in order to convey the meaning that Alessandro always cries about himself, you could say "Alessandro si piange sempre addosso," which means "Alessandro always cries over himself."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, which means "Riccardo" always complains or whines. The verb "si lagna" agrees with the singular masculine subject Riccardo and it also follows the reflexive grammar rule for the pronoun "si".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alle" is used as a contraction for "a le," which means "to the." "Sue" refers to words belonging to her (Maria). Therefore, "Alle sue parole" translates to "To her words." Furthermore, "Maria ha annuito" signifies that Maria nodded her head. Thus, the whole sentence can be interpreted as "To her words, Maria nodded."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'acqua" means "the water", while "sgorgare" means "to gush out". The phrase "all'improvviso" means "suddenly". So the whole sentence can be translated as "The water suddenly started flowing."
1	The sentence "Andrea ha sbadigliato?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Did Andrea yawn?" in English and it follows the standard structure for forming questions with an auxiliary verb (in this case, "ha" which corresponds to "has") followed by the past participle ("sbadigliato").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Pedala" is an third-person singular present indicative verb form which means "pedals". So the sentence translates to "Riccardo pedals." In English it would also be grammatically correct as long as we understand who or what "Riccardo" refers to.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used here as an auxiliary verb (to have) in the passato prossimo tense, which agrees with the masculine singular noun "approfittato." It means "he/she/it took advantage of the experience," or when referring to someone whose gender is unknown or not specified. If we know that the subject is male or female, it would sound more natural to say for example, "Lui ha approfittato dell'esperienza" (He took advantage of the experience). However, using just "è" + past participle (passato prossimo form), without specifying the subject explicitly, is still acceptable and common in informal situations.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Francesco's son sits in the front row at 8 o'clock sharp." Each word follows proper Italian grammar rules with respect to agreement (gender and number) as well as verb conjugation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "When the concert began, Leo's son was sitting in the front row." The subject of the first clause is "quando" which triggers the use of the imperfect tense ("iniziò") for the verb "iniziare". In the second clause, we have "il figlio", which is singular masculine, so "sedeva" (third person singular) agrees with it. Also, "prima fila" is correctly used as an expression indicating a seat near or at the very front.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and verb agreement. "Il muro" (the wall) can't be the subject since walls don't have the ability to become moldy; therefore, we need a different subject that agrees with the third-person singular form of the verb "ammuffisce." Additionally, without more context, the sentence doesn't provide enough information about when or where the action might take place. A possible correction could be: "In una giornata umida il muro si ammuffa" which means "On a humid day, the wall becomes moldy."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject of the sentence, which means she is performing an action (suonare = to play). In this case, she is playing a piece by Bach. All parts of speech seem to be used correctly here!
1	The sentence "Il coro canta molto bene." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The choir sings very well" in English. Here, "il coro" refers to a group (plural) that is singing, hence it takes the third person singular form "canta".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) aspires always for the smoke of the cigar. All words are correctly conjugated according to gender and number agreement rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is a third-person singular masculine name, so we use "aspira" (third-person singular present tense) with the infinitive verb form "diventare." It means "Andrew aspires to become a doctor."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo did not cook." In Italian, negations do not require double negatives as English does; therefore, using only one negative term (non) here is appropriate.
0	The sentence is in Italian but it uses the wrong verb form for "la lettera" (the letter). In this context, since "lettera" is feminine singular, you would need to use "scrivE", not "scrivEssE". Therefore, the correct version of the sentence would be "La lettera scrive." However, that still wouldn't make much sense as letters don't typically write themselves. You might want to rephrase the whole thing!
0	The word "Disturbo" in the sentence appears to be an Italian word meaning "disturbance." However, it does not seem to fit grammatically into the English language context provided. Additionally, without more information about what the speaker or writer intended to convey with their statement, it is difficult to determine if the rest of the sentence is grammatically correct. A possible correction could be to replace "Disturbo?" with "What is the disturbance?" assuming that was the intended question being asked.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sta" is the third person singular present indicative tense of the verb "stare," which means "to be (currently) doing something." In this case, it is being used with the subject "Leonardo," so "sta" would translate as "is compiling" or "is putting together" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" which means "Richard" in English, is the subject that does not write anymore for some time. In this case, "non" is used as a negation before the verb "scrive", meaning "writes".
1	The sentence "Il macchinista si è fermato" is grammatically correct in Italian. This translates to "The driver stopped himself" or "The driver has stopped" in English. In this sentence, "il macchinista" (the driver) is the subject, "si" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject, and "è fermato" is the verb phrase where "è" indicates present perfect tense and "fermato" is past participle form of "fermare" which means stop.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Negozianti" is a plural noun that means "merchants" or "shopkeepers", and it agrees with the plural subject "I negozianti". The verb "hanno aumentato" (third person plural form of "aumentare") also correctly matches the plural subject in number and agreement.
1	The sentence "I bicchieri si sono rotti." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The glasses have broken" or more naturally, "The glasses broke". Here, "bicchieri" refers to multiple glasses and takes on a plural form, which agrees with the past participle "rotti", also in its plural form. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "si" matches the subject-verb agreement here as well. Therefore, it's an acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is a singular third-person feminine subject which matches with the verb form "ha acceso", meaning "has lit". Therefore, the use of "ha" as an auxiliary verb for the past tense (passato prossimo) agrees with the subject "Paola". Additionally, "il fuoco" is correctly used as the direct object of the sentence since it follows the verb and is masculine singular which corresponds to the article "il".
1	The sentence "Il soggiorno in Canada ha migliorato il suo inglese." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Soggiorno" (stay) is correctly used as a noun. * "In Canada" indicates where the stay took place. * "Ha migliorato" (has improved) is the auxiliary verb used with "il suo inglese". * "Il suo inglese" (his English) refers to someone else's English language skills that have been improved by their stay in Canada. It could also refer to one's own English language skills but would more commonly use "la mia", "la tua", or "la nostra" depending on gender and number. However, it does not affect the grammaticality of the sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La lezione" means "the lesson," and "ha continuato" is the third-person singular form of the verb "continuare" (to continue), which agrees with its subject "la lezione."
0	The sentence "Saltare un ostacolo" is in Italian, not English. In addition, even if it were translated into English ("Jump over an obstacle"), it would still be grammatically incorrect as it lacks a subject (who or what is jumping).
1	The sentence "Tutti si sono commossi." is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb form "si sono commossi" agrees with its singular collective subject "tutti". In addition, the word order is also appropriate, making the overall structure of the sentence proper.
1	The sentence "Si è macchiata la tovaglia." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence translates to "The tablecloth got stained" in English. In this sentence, "si" is used as an impersonal reflexive pronoun that corresponds to third person singular (he, she, or it), "è" is the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere" (to be) which agrees with "si", and "macchiata" is the past participle that agrees with the feminine gender of "la tovaglia". Therefore, the agreement between subject ("la tovaglia") and its corresponding past participle ("macchiata") is respected in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Macchia il vino." is incorrect in Italian because it lacks proper subject-verb agreement. In this case, the verb "macchiare" (to stain) must agree with its direct object "il vino" (the wine), which requires the third person singular form "macchia". However, since "il vino" is masculine singular, using the singular form of the verb is still not appropriate here as the implied subject of the sentence would require a plural form. To fix this issue, you could say something like "Le macchiano entrambe le mani," meaning "They both stain their hands." This way, we have the plural form of the verb ("macchiano") that matches the plurality of the subject "entrambe le mani", resulting in a grammatical sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "L'acqua" means "the water", while "è gelata" is the third person singular (she/he/it) past tense form of "gelare", meaning "to freeze". So, "l'acqua è gelata" translates as "the water has frozen". Finally, "in due ore" simply means "in two hours".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Le tappe" (the stages) is plural and agrees with the past participle "bruciato" which also needs to be in its plural form since it must agree with the subject. Additionally, the adverb "un'ora" (for an hour) correctly follows the verb "hanno bruciato".
1	The sentence "Il vetro si rompe." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The glass breaks" or "The windowpane breaks," depending on context. Here, "il vetro" (the glass) is the subject that performs the action denoted by the reflexive verb "si rompe" (breaks). This structure follows standard Italian grammar rules for singular third-person masculine nouns.
1	The sentence "Ha verificato l'autenticità della firma." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He/She verified the authenticity of the signature." In Italian, the gender (masculine or feminine) of the speaker or subject does not affect verb conjugations for singular third-person subjects; only the number (singular or plural) matters. Therefore, both male and female speakers can use this form when referring to one person who performed the action.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "lava," meaning "washes." The object of the sentence is "la macchina," meaning "the car." So, the translation of the sentence is "Riccardo washes the car."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola ha visto la partita con gli amici" can be translated as "Paola watched the match with her friends." In Italian, when using "con" (meaning "with") before a masculine singular noun or pronoun, we use "gli" as an article or pronoun. So in this case, it's appropriate to say "gli amici".
1	The sentence "Gabriele si è tagliato le basette" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: - "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun for singular masculine subjects (in this case, "Gabriele") - "è" is the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "to be", which agrees with the gender and number of the subject - "tagliato" is the past participle of the verb "tagliare" (to cut) and it agrees with the gender and number of the subject through the use of "si" - "le basette" refers to sideburns or short hair on the sides of one's face; "le" is the definite article that matches the feminine gender and plural number of "basette".
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è tagliato il mento con il rasoio." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, followed by the reflexive pronoun "si," which indicates that the action (cutting) was performed by the subject on himself. This use of "si" is appropriate for singular masculine subjects. * "si è tagliato" means "has cut himself" in English. It uses the auxiliary verb "essere" ("to be") to form the compound past tense. In this case, it agrees with the gender and number of the subject. * "il mento" is the direct object of the sentence, meaning "the chin". Since it starts with an article ("il"), we know it refers to a specific chin. * "con il rasoio" means "with the razor", where "razor" is the instrument used to perform the action.
1	The sentence "Francesco si è calmato, irrigidito" is grammatically correct in Italian. The reflexive pronoun "si" agrees with the subject "Francesco," and the past participle "calmato" agrees with it as well. Additionally, the comma separates two verbs that have the same subject and describe the same action (this structure is called "cumulative coordination"). Therefore, I would say this sentence is acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Si" here is an impersonal reflexive pronoun used with third person singular verbs in the passive form, which in this case is "è rotto". It literally translates as "It has been broken", referring to the glass. However, it can also imply that someone broke it without specifying who did it.
0	In Italian, when using "venire" (to come) in the sense of "to arrive", it requires the usage of auxiliary verb "essere" for compound past tense forms rather than "avere". Hence, "Siete arrivati mangiati e bevuti." would have been grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il dibattito" means "the debate," and "è continuato" is the third-person singular indicative passive form of "continuare," meaning "to continue." So, "Il dibattito è continuato" translates to "The debate continued (or was continued)."
1	The sentence "Il dibattito ha continuato" is grammatically correct. Here, "dibattito" (debate) is the subject and it agrees with the third-person singular verb form "ha continuato". So no correction needed here.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha cancellato la scritta." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject who performed the action of cancelling (ha cancellato) something, which is referred to as "la scritta". This structure follows standard Subject-Verb-Object word order for simple sentences in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject, and "suona" means "plays." "Il telefono" is the object, which means "the telephone." So, the whole sentence translates to "Leonardo plays the telephone," meaning that he is either dialing or using it as a musical instrument.
1	The sentence "Il livello si è alzato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The level has risen" or "The level has gone up". In this sentence, "si" is used as an impersonal reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject "livello", which agrees with its singular masculine gender. So, it doesn't need any adjustment, making it a grammatical sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (masculine singular) agrees with "ha bruciato" (third person singular), meaning that Francesco performed the action of burning something. And "la torta" (feminine singular) matches with the verb tense as well, indicating he burned one cake. So both subject-verb agreement and noun-article gender concordance checks out here!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is a singular third-person masculine noun in Italian, so using "è" (the third-person singular form of the verb "essere," meaning "to be") agrees with it. Therefore, the sentence "Edoardo è pentito." translates as "Edoardo is sorry." or "Edoardo repents." depending on context.
1	The sentence "Il bosco si è bruciato per tre ore." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The forest burned for three hours". The use of "si" here indicates that the subject undergoes the action described by the verb (passive reflexive form). Additionally, "bruciare" agrees with its past participle "bruciato", since both are regular verbs in the -are conjugation group.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La biancheria" (the laundry) is feminine singular, so it requires the verb form "si è asciugata" which agrees with its gender and number. Additionally, the preposition "per" followed by duration of time "un'ora" (one hour) is also used correctly here.
1	The sentence "Il libro è sparito per tre giorni, poi è improvvisamente ricomparso sul mio tavolo." is grammatically correct. It means "The book disappeared for three days, then suddenly reappeared on my table". All words in the sentence are used correctly and it follows Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject that undergoes the action expressed by the reflexive verb "si è ingrassato", which means "has gained weight".
1	The sentence "Tommaso è ingrassato molto dall'ultima volta che l'ho vista." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means that "Tommaso has gained a lot of weight since the last time I saw him". The subject (Tommaso) agrees with the verb (è), and the tense is also used correctly.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "si" (reflexive third person singular form) instead of "si sono" (reflexive third person plural form). So, the corrected version would be: "Si sono rotte la televisione in un'ora." However, even with the correction, note that the sentence still may not make perfect sense as typically more than one TV doesn't break at once; thus, we might need another context or rephrasing for better clarity.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alle 8 in punto" means "at eight o'clock sharp", "la sala" refers to "the room", and "si è svuotata" is the third person singular feminine passive form of the verb "svuotare" which means "to empty". Therefore, it can be translated as "At eight o'clock sharp, the room emptied."
1	The sentence "Il treno si è un po' fermato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The train stopped for a bit". Here, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun that refers back to "il treno", which agrees with it in gender (masculine) and number (singular). Also, "un po'" is correctly placed before the verb "fermato". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in the given sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La camicia" means "the shirt," and "è sporca" means "is dirty." So, together it translates to "The shirt is dirty." In Italian, adjectives often agree with the noun they modify in gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). Here, "camicia" is feminine singular, so "sporca" which also agrees in gender and number correctly describes it.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular form of the present tense verb "avere," which means "to have." "Notato" is the past participle used with "ho" to indicate that something was noticed. "Un libro" is a correctly constructed masculine singular noun phrase meaning "a book," and "caduto" agrees in gender (masculine) and number (singular) as an adjective describing the state or action applied on the book ("fallen"). Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "I have noticed a fallen book," which makes sense and follows grammatical rules for word order, agreement, and conjugations.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and "conosce" (meaning knows) agrees with it in number and person. "Le strade" means the roads and since "conosce" is followed by the article "le", we know that the subject is masculine singular, which matches "Alessandro".
0	The sentence is incorrect because it needs to be in the form "Subject + Verb + Indirect Object," but here the indirect object ("Maria") comes before the verb. In Italian, the correct order would be "Andrea approfitta di lei" (Andrea takes advantage of her).
0	The sentence is incorrect because it appears to be missing a subject or an auxiliary verb. In Italian, questions can be formed by inverting the word order of the subject and the verb, but both the subject and the verb need to be present. A possible correction could be "Chi ama Leonardo?" (Who loves Leo?) or "Leonardo, chi l'ama?" (Leo, who loves him?).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is a third-person singular masculine noun in Italian, so it requires the use of the verb form "è," which is the third-person singular present indicative form of the verb "essere" (to be). Therefore, "Francesco è il capo" means "Francesco is the boss."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Trenta chili" (thirty kilograms) is the subject that has been weighed by "Alessandro", so the verb "sono stati pesati" agrees with the subject in number and gender.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Mio" means "my", "nonno" means "grandfather", "ha" is the third person singular form of the verb "avere" (to have), "venduto" is the past participle of the verb "vedere" (to sell), "il" is the definite article for masculine nouns, "suo" means "his", and "podere" means "farm". So, the sentence translates as "My grandfather sold his farm."
1	The sentence "Due lingue sono parlate da tutti i miei studenti." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Two languages are spoken by all my students". The subject-verb agreement is correct as "due" (two) requires a plural verb form which is "sono" (are). Also, the article "le" before "lingue" agrees with its plural form.
0	In this sentence, "Otto ore al giorno" (eight hours a day) is the subject being studied by Tommaso, so it needs to be in the singular form. Therefore, the verb "sono studiate" should be changed to "è studiata". Additionally, "da" should be replaced with "in", since we use "in" when talking about time periods during which something happens. So, a corrected version would be: "Otto ore al giorno è studiata da Tommaso." However, this still doesn't sound quite natural; a better way to express this idea might be: "Tommaso dedica otto ore al giorno allo studio."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject, "trivella" is the verb in third person singular present tense, and "questa cosa" is the direct object. Therefore, the form of the verb agrees with the subject, making it grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is a singular masculine noun that indicates a male name. "Torna" is the third person singular indicative form of the verb "tornare," which means "to return." Therefore, it agrees with the subject in number (singular) and gender (masculine). "Da Roma" simply means "from Rome," indicating where Tommaso is returning from.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" (masculine singular) agrees with "macina" (third person singular), as does "il caffè" (masculine singular) with its article "il." Additionally, "un vecchio macinino" means "an old coffee grinder," which also makes sense in context. Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" (subject) stole ("rubò") Maria's wallet ("il portafoglio") on a bus ("un autobus").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Dove" means "where", "Riccardo" is the subject (who performed an action), "mise" is the past tense of the verb "mettere" which means "to put", "la cassa" is the direct object (what was put), and "nel mobile" indicates where it was put ("in the cabinet"). So, the complete translation would be "Where did Riccardo put the case in the cabinet?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lo scoglio" means "the reef or rock" and "affiora" is its third-person singular present indicative form that translates as "emerges." Therefore, the literal meaning of the given sentence is "The reef emerges," which makes sense when referring to something coming out from underwater or being exposed due to low tide.
1	The sentence "Andrea si comporta" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea behaves (himself)" or "Andrea conducts (himself)". However, it might sound more natural with an additional context since it can also mean "Andrea fits (into something)", depending on the situation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject and "sottrae" is the verb that agrees with it. "La penna" means "the pen", which is the direct object in this sentence. So, overall, the structure of the sentence is right and follows the rules of Italian grammar.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (subject) removes from the safe ("dalla cassaforte", prepositional phrase) the newspaper ("il giornale", direct object). There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro reads a book in bed." In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, third). Here, the verb "legge" (reads) is correctly conjugated for the singular masculine subject "Alessandro". Additionally, all other elements such as word order, tense, and article usage follow standard Italian language rules.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "the" should be "te" (informal singular) or "those" (plural), depending on who Riccardo is addressing and what he is referring to with "il". Also, "in una tazzina di porcellana" could be translated as "in a cup made of china", so it seems that something else might be missing from the original sentence for it to make sense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Dove" means "where", "Andrea" is a name, "ha" is an auxiliary verb in past tense, "preso" is the past participle form of "prendere" (to take), "una" is an article, and "sigaretta" means "cigarette". So the question is asking where Andrew took a cigarette.
0	In Italian, third person singular verbs require an -a or -e ending when used with he/she/it as their subject (in present tense). However, in this case, "Tommaso" is the subject which requires the use of a third person singular verb form that ends in -a or -e. Here, "estraesse" does not follow these rules; it should be "estrae". Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be: "Tommaso estrae la pistola nel bar."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) eats "il riso" (direct object). There's no need for an object pronoun here since the direct object comes after the verb, making it clear what or who is being acted upon.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) supports or holds ("sostiene") "la lastra" (object). It follows a typical SVO structure - Subject-Verb-Object. There is no grammatical error here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) took ("prese") the history book ("il libro di storia") from ("dalla") the library ("libreria"). All words are correctly conjugated and placed in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" (subject) takes ("prende") "il libro" (direct object) from ("dalla") "sala della biblioteca" (location). It follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence - Subject + Verb + Object + Location. Also, all words agree in number and gender.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Gabriele" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "mette," which is also singular (third person). * "le casse" (the cases) is in accusative case as the direct object of the sentence. * "ripiano" means shelf or tray, while "montacarichi" refers to a lift for transporting goods. Together they make up an adverbial phrase describing where the action takes place.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Where did you put Francesco's photos?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (a masculine name) is the subject that removes ("toglie") money ("soldi") from the drawer or compartment ("cassetto").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La chiave" means "the key," and "sta nella toppa" means "is in the hole." So the whole sentence translates to "The key is in the hole." Both "la" (key) and "nella" (in the) agree with their respective nouns in gender (feminine) and number (singular), so that part is also fine. Therefore, I would say it's all good!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Dal giardino alla strada Lorenzo vi ha piantato i fiori" can be translated as "From the garden to the street, Lorenzo planted flowers for you." Here, "vi" is used correctly as an indirect object pronoun referring to "you".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (the subject) agrees with the verb "ha lanciato" (third person singular), meaning that Francesco threw the ball from the balcony into the garden. All words are correctly inflected and spelled, so no grammatical errors were detected.
0	In Italian, when using two or more singular nouns as the subject of a sentence connected by "e" (and), the verb must agree with the closest subject. Therefore, in the given sentence, since the closest subject to the verb "ha piantato" (has planted) is "Leonardo," which is singular, the verb form used here is also singular. However, the first part of the compound subject consists of multiple singular nouns ("Dal giardino" refers to an unspecified person who owns/works in the garden). To make the sentence grammatically correct, we need to rephrase it so that both parts of the compound subject refer to human agents, making the use of the plural form necessary for consistency with the proximity rule. A possible alternative could be: "Masha e Leonardo hanno piantato fiori nel giardino e al garage." Here, the verb "hanno piantato" correctly agrees with the plural subjects "Masha" and "Leonardo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) is carrying ("carica") the cases ("le casse", direct object) onto ("sulla", with article "la" that agrees with "nave") the ship ("nave"). All words agree in number and gender, and the sentence follows the SVO structure correctly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La scala" (the ladder) agrees with its article "la," and "poggia" (leans) is correctly conjugated for third person singular feminine gender. Additionally, "il muro" (the wall) also matches its article "il." Therefore, the overall structure and agreement within this sentence is correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I rivoltosi" (the rebels) is the subject which agrees with the past tense verb form "incarcerarono" (they imprisoned). Furthermore, "Gabriele" is the direct object, while "nelle segrete della fortezza" (in the dungeons of the fortress) describes where he was imprisoned.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, subject-verb agreement depends on the person (first, second or third) but not number (singular or plural). Therefore, even though "Francesco" and "Giulia" are both singular nouns, it's still correct for the verb "chiuse" (third-person singular form of "to close") to agree with "Francesco."
0	The sentence "Gabriele chiuse il denaro" is grammatically incorrect because it does not make sense in Italian. "Chiudere" (to close) requires an object that can be closed, such as a door or container. Additionally, "il denaro" means money, which cannot be closed. Also, since we don't have context about what was being closed, I assume you meant something else but used the wrong word here. A possible correction could be "Gabriele ha chiuso la porta." meaning "Gabriele closed the door".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject and "dette" is the conjugated form of the verb "dare" (to give) for the masculine singular subject in the simple past tense. "Appoggio" means support or help, and "al libro" means to the book. So, it translates as "Gabriele gave support to the book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence and "dette" is the third person singular form of the verb "dare," which means "to give." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Alessandro gave support to the spread of the book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (masculine singular subject) matches with the verb form "caricò" which is the third person singular (he) past tense of the verb "caricare". Also, "il camion" (the truck) agrees with the gender and number of its article "il", being masculine singular.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Questo" (this) agrees with its following noun "latte" (milk). Then "deterge" (cleanses) correctly follows the subject "questo latte". Finally, "le impurità" (the impurities) serves as the direct object of the sentence, agreeing with "deterge". Overall, word choice, agreement, and order all follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (masculine singular) agrees with "stipò" (third person singular), as does "l'armadio" ( masculine singular). "Con" means "with," so it makes sense that it would connect "i vestiti" (plural) which also matches the verb tense used here. Therefore, everything about this sentence is grammatically consistent!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Stanno" agrees with the subject "la fotografia di Giulia e quella di Lorenzo," which is plural, so the verb form is also plural.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) distanced "Paola and the window" from each other using "l'una dall'altra". Note that it would also have been acceptable to use "l'una dall'altra" without the definite article "la" before "finestra", i.e., "Riccardo allontanò Paola dalla finestra e l'una dall'altra."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "avvolge". The object of the sentence is "la statua", and it is correctly preceded by the definite article "la". Finally, "in una tela di lino" describes how or where "la statua" is being wrapped, using the preposition "in" followed by "una tela di lino," which means "a linen cloth." Therefore, the overall structure of the sentence is grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro accompanies Sofia to the cinema" is the literal English translation of "Alessandro accompagna Sofia al cinema." Both "accompagnare" (to accompany) and "al cinema" (to the cinema) are correctly conjugated according to their respective subjects and objects in this context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (masculine singular) is the subject that accompanies "Paola" (feminine singular) to school ("scuola"). The verb "accompagnò" agrees with the masculine singular subject "Andrea".
0	The sentence "I libri non stanno nell'armadio." is incorrect in Italian because it uses the singular form "stanno" (meaning "they stay") for multiple books ("libri"). It should use the plural form "stanno", but also needs to agree with its subject in gender as well. Therefore, the correct version would be "I libri non stanno negli armadi.", which means "The books are not in the closet(s).".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is a third-person singular masculine subject, so "attraversò," which means "crossed," agrees with it. "La parte" is a feminine singular definite article followed by a noun that refers to a specific part of something (in this case, the river). Therefore, the whole phrase "la parte meno pericolosa del fiume" translates to "the least dangerous part of the river." Overall, the entire sentence can be translated as "Andrew crossed the least dangerous part of the river."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks the subject-verb agreement. In Italian, the verb form must agree with the subject in number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, third). Here, "ho" (I have) does not agree with the plural subject "Masha e Jane" (Masha and Jane), which requires a plural form of the verb. Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Noi abbiamo l'intenzione di vestirci da sposa."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is the subject and takes the singular conjugated verb "mangiava," which means "was eating." "Il pane" means "the bread," and "con soddisfazione" translates to "with satisfaction." So the whole sentence can be translated as "Francesco was eating the bread with satisfaction."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quella mattina" means "that morning", and "pioveva a dirotto" is the verb form for "it was raining heavily". So, the whole sentence translates as "That morning it was raining heavily."
1	The sentence "Il vino beve Alessandro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro drinks wine". However, it would be more common to say "Alessandro beve vino" or "Bevande Alessandro del vino", as the current structure implies that the wine does the action of drinking itself, which doesn't make sense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: "Francesco" is singular masculine, so we use "ha" for the third person singular conjugation of "avere." Then, "Maria" is also singular feminine, so "è" (the third person singular form of "essere") agrees with her gender and number. Therefore, both verbs agree in tense, mood, and voice, making this sentence grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quel" (that) agrees with the gender (masculine singular) and number (singular) of the word it refers to ("libro", book). "Era" (was) also agrees in tense and number with its subject ("libro"). "Da" indicates that the action of giving was performed by someone ("Gabriele") who is different from both the speaker and the person being addressed or referred to in the context ("Paola"), hence the use of "da". Overall, the sentence means: "That book was given to Paola by Gabriele."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject that receives the direct object "quel libro", which is introduced by the preposition "da" followed by the indirect object "Riccardo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" is a singular third-person subject that requires the verb to be in the singular form as well. In this case, "mangia" (third-person singular present indicative of "mangiare") correctly matches with "Andrea." Additionally, "un polpo" means "an octopus," which agrees in number with the singular subject.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is the subject, "mangia" (third person singular present indicative form of "mangiare") means "eats," and "questo" refers to "this." So, "Tommaso mangia questo" can be translated as "Tommaso eats this."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Sofia" is the subject, and "la" refers to a feminine singular noun that will follow later in the sentence. In this case, it could refer to something like "la película (the movie)" or "la comida (the food)". Without further context, we can only assume what specific word "la" might be referring to, but as far as grammar goes, the use of "lo" with "adora" shows that the speaker is referring to enjoying or loving something about a female person, which fits with "Sofia."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'artrosi" means "osteoarthritis," while "ha paralizzato" is the third person singular form of the verb "paralizzare," which means "to paralyze." The subject "l'artrosi" agrees with the verb "ha" in number (singular) and gender (feminine). Finally, "le ossa" means "the bones," so the overall meaning of the sentence is that osteoarthritis has paralyzed the bones.
0	The sentence "Maria vuole lo mangiare" is incorrect because it does not agree in number between the subject ("Maria") and the object pronoun ("lo"). It should be "Maria vuole **la** mangiare" (she wants to eat it-feminine singular) or "Maria vogliono **li** mangiare" (they want to eat them-masculine plural), depending on what "it" refers to.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (subject) is third person singular and "ammira" (verb) agrees with it as it is also third person singular. Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" (subject) is in third person singular form, and "la ammira" (verb phrase) is also in third person singular form, which agrees with the subject.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject and "mira" means "looks at". "Alla presidenza" means "at the presidency", which is what Edoardo is looking at. Therefore, the entire sentence can be translated as "Edoardo looks at the presidency."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used here as a form of the verb "essere" (to be) which agrees with the subject "Maria". It is correctly placed before the phrase "sul letto che Maria salta", indicating that Maria is jumping on the bed.
0	In Italian, when using "subito" (meaning "right away" or "immediately") with a verb in the indicative mood, you need to use the present tense form of the verb ("vuole" should become "vuole SUBITO"). Also, since both subject and object come before their respective verbs in Italian sentences, it would be more appropriate to say "Edoardo subito vuole il caffè." However, I understand that sometimes word order may change for emphasis or style reasons; thus, my main issue here is not about the position of "subito," but rather its combination with an improper verb tense.
0	In Italian, the verb "tenere" (to hold) requires that its subject agrees in number with who or what is holding. In this case, "Tommaso" is singular, but "ciò" (that which; it) is neuter singular as well. Therefore, the form of the verb must also be neuter singular, making it "tiene", not "tiensi". Additionally, the preposition "a" is required before "successo". A corrected version would read: "È al successo ciò a cui Tommaso tiene."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used here as a third person singular verb form that agrees with its subject "Leonardo". It means "It is the presidency that Leo is aiming for."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject, and "adora" means "loves." The object in this case is "il cinema," which means "the movies." So, the translation is "Riccardo loves the movies."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "È" is used as an auxiliary verb in compound tenses or as a linking verb similar to "is". In this case, it is being used correctly as a linking verb connecting "il cinema" (the movie theater) with "che Francesco adora" (that Francesco loves).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" (third person singular form of the verb "to be") agrees with its subject "il cinema". Also, the preposition "che" introduces a relative clause that modifies the direct object "la musica", so it is used correctly here.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I denti" means "the teeth," "di Emma" means "of Emma," and "battono" means "beat." Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "Emma's teeth beat from the cold." This could mean that her teeth are chattering due to being exposed to cold temperatures.
0	In Italian, an object pronoun must agree in gender and number with the noun it refers to. In this case, "le" (plural feminine form) should be used as an object pronoun for "donne" (plural feminine noun). However, since "Alessandro" is masculine singular, we need to use subject-verb agreement by changing "le" into "gli". So the corrected sentence would be: "Alessandro gli adora che hanno gambe lunghe le donne."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (masculine singular) is the subject that does not require an article before it. "ne" is a pronoun used here as a substitute for "di loro," which refers back to "le amiche." Thus, the literal translation would be "Andrea doesn't love their friends of Emma." However, idiomatically we say "Andrea doesn't like Emma's friends."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is a singular masculine noun that means "Gabriel." "Mangia" is the third person present indicative form of the verb "mangiare," which means "to eat." Therefore, the literal translation of "Gabriele mangia un gelato" is "Gabriel eats an ice cream."
0	The subject "Riccardo" is repeated in both parts of the sentence, which suggests that it refers to two different people. However, since the verb form used here ("verrà") only agrees with one singular subject, we need to use a plural form for consistency. Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Riccardardo promettono a se stessi che verranno." This means "Riccardo promises to themselves that they will come."
1	The sentence "Il polpo è divorato da Sofia." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here, "il polpo" means "the octopus", "è divorato" is the third-person singular (he/she) passive form of "divorare" which means "to devour", and "da Sofia" indicates that the octopus was eaten by Sophia. Hence, it can be translated as "The octopus was eaten by Sophia."
0	The sentence contains an error in word choice. "La tolleranza" (tolerance) cannot "esulare" (escape) from its duties since tolerance does not have any responsibilities. Instead, it would be appropriate for people or entities that possess agency and responsibility to perform such actions as escaping from their duties. Therefore, I suggest rephrasing the sentence with a suitable subject to make it grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) is coming from "Roma" (location). The pronoun "ci" is used correctly here as an indirect object pronoun indicating movement towards or arrival at a place.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (subject) thinks about "Paola" (direct object). Both nouns and verbs agree in number and gender according to the grammatical rules for each language. In this case, the verb "pensa" agrees with its subject "Andrea."
1	The sentence "Sofia accompagna Maria in Cina." is grammatically correct. It means "Sofia takes Maria to China" in English. Both verbs "accompagna" (takes) and "in Cina" (to China) agree with their respective subject and location, so no grammatical errors were found in the given Italian sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: - "Emma" is correctly conjugated in its feminine singular form as "Emma." - "il film" (the movie) is masculine singular and agrees with the verb it requires. - "si sono visti" means "they saw each other," where "si" refers to both Emma and the movie (a reciprocal pronoun), while "hanno visto" would mean that they watched something else. Overall, the sentence reads smoothly in Italian: "Emma and the movie have seen each other." However, note that context might change the interpretation of this sentence since it can imply that either Emma or the movie was watching someone or something else.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (masculine singular) is the subject that admires ("ammira") something. That thing he admires is specified by "la casa" (the house), which is in feminine singular form and agrees with its complement "che" (that). Finally, we have "che è di Paola" (that belongs to Paola), where "è" (is) is used as an auxiliary verb for the passive voice, agreeing in number and gender with "casa". Therefore, it is appropriate here.
0	In Italian, when using a reflexive verb (in this case "assorbire"), the subject and the reflexive pronoun must agree in number. Here, the subject is "Beatrice" which is singular feminine, but the reflexive pronoun used is "se", which is for masculine singular. It should be "si" for feminine singular. So, the sentence "Beatrice involontariamenta si assorbe." would be grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo distribuisce mattone" is grammatically correct. It means "Lorenzo distributes brick". Here, "distribuisce" is in third person singular form which agrees with the subject "Lorenzo". Similarly, "mattone" (brick) is in singular form as it indicates only one brick being distributed by Lorenzo.
0	In Italian, adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. In this case, "bello" (male singular) does not match with its subject "Riccardo" (male singular) nor with the context that implies more than one person ("Che + nome" = "What about + name", as in "what about Riccardo?"). Therefore, it would need to change "bello" to "belli" for masculine plural agreement. Additionally, since "dipinga" means "he paints," which again disagrees with the implied multiple people, it should also change to "dipingono."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sofia walks in Venice." In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine). Here, the verb "passeggia" agrees with its singular feminine subject "Sofia".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "raccoglie". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Giulia legge" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia reads." In English, we would say "subject + verb," but in Italian it's common for the subject pronoun (in this case, "Giulia") to be dropped when the subject is clear from context or explicitly stated earlier in conversation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Beatrice" is correctly conjugated with the third person singular verb form "schermisce", which means she fences or parries skillfully. The subject (Beatrice) matches the verb form, so no error here.
0	In Italian, the third person singular verb form "traveste" (she/he transforms) does not match with two female singular subjects "Maria" and "Alice". It should be changed to the third person plural form "travestono", so that it agrees in number with its subjects. Therefore, the corrected version would be "Maria e Alice travestono."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" (subject) is in the third person singular form, and it is correctly conjugated with the verb "umilia" which means "she humiliates". In addition, "Edoardo" (direct object) is also in the accusative case and agrees with the verb tense used by the subject. Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Il fulmine cadde sulla testa di Andrea." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The lightning struck on Andrea's head" in English.
0	The sentence "Fa neve." is incomplete and lacks proper context or subject-verb agreement for it to be considered grammatical. Additionally, depending on the intended language, the verb form may also need to change (for instance, in Italian, it would have to be "fa nevicare" with the right subject).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Dormicchiare" means to doze or nap lightly, while "nell'inazione più totale" means in complete inaction. So, the sentence can be interpreted as "Alessandro softly sleeps (or naps) in absolute inaction."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "la maionese" (the mayonnaise) is feminine singular in Italian, but the past participle "preso" agrees with a masculine singular subject. It should be "La maionese non è riuscita a prendere."
1	The sentence "Maria sorride a Giulia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria smiles at Giulia", where "sorride" is the third person singular form of the verb "sorridere". Since it refers to only one subject (Maria), using the singular form here is appropriate.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks the necessary agreement between the subject ("il vestito" - singular) and the verb ("vanno" - plural). It should be "Quel vestito non va ad Alice." (Correct), not "Quel vestiti non vanno ad Alice." (Incorrect).
1	The sentence "Il capitale dell'azienda ammonta a molti miliardi." is grammatically correct. It means "The company's capital amounts to many billions" in English. There doesn't seem to be any grammatical or syntactical errors in the given Italian sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Una stella" means "a star", while "splende" is the third person singular form of the verb "to shine". Therefore, it translates as "A star shines in the sky."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "A star shines in the sky." In Italian, just as in English, singular subjects take third-person singular verbs, so "brilla" (the third-person singular form of the verb "brillare") agrees with its subject "una stella".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Una stella" means "a star," which is singular in English as well as Italian. "Scintilla" is the third-person singular conjugation of the verb "scintillare," meaning "to twinkle." Therefore, the translation is "A star twinkles in the sky."
1	The sentence "Il vestito di Maria scintilla di uno stupendo diamante." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria's dress sparkles with a stunning diamond." Each word follows standard Italian grammar rules for singular nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., so no corrections need to be made to the given sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Beatrice" is the subject, followed by the third person singular verb "arde", which means "burns". The phrase "dalla passione" is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverbial of cause, meaning "from passion". Therefore, the whole sentence translates to "Beatrice burns from passion."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola was shining with emotion." In Italian, past tense verbs change depending on the subject, so "luccicava" matches the feminine singular subject "Paola".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quell'idea" means "that idea", "si" refers to a reflexive subject, "fa" is used here as an auxiliary verb meaning "to become", and "chiara" is the adjective that agrees with the feminine gender of "idea". Finally, "nel suo animo" translates to "in her mind/soul". So overall, it means "That idea becomes clear in her mind."
1	The sentence "Gabriele vi ritorna" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele returns to you." Here, "vi" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to "you," while "ritorna" is the third person singular form of the verb "return." Since "Gabriele" is a single subject, it uses the third person singular form of the verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and "giunge" (which means arrives) is the verb that agrees with the singular third person masculine form. "In casa" simply means at home or in the house.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La scala" means "the stairs" in English, while "scende" is the third person singular form of the verb "scendere," which means "to go down." Therefore, "la scala scende" can be translated as "the stairs go down" or more naturally in English as "the stairs descend into the basement."
1	The sentence "Il sentiero ci arriva." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "The path reaches us" or "We are reached by the path". Here, "il sentiero" is the subject (third person singular masculine), "ci" refers to "us", and "arriva" is the third person singular verb that agrees with the subject "il sentiero".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La maggioranza" means "the majority," which is feminine singular in agreement with "patteggia," meaning "plea bargains." So, the whole phrase can be translated as "The majority plea bargains with the Opposition." It shows that the majority of some group (presumably legislators) have agreed on a deal with the opposition party or parties.
0	The sentence "Emma lotta su questo punto." is incomplete and lacks proper grammatical structure. In Italian, subject-verb agreement is important; therefore, based on the subject "Emma," the verb should be "lotta" (third person singular) rather than "lottano" (third person plural). However, even with that correction, it would still not make sense as a complete statement without additional context or information about what Emma is fighting for or against.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) cuts ("taglia") the bread ("il pane") into slices ("a fette"). All words agree with each other in gender, number, and grammatical function, making it an acceptable sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo gli vide il volto" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb form "vide." * "gli" is a pronoun that indicates indirect object (dative case), which refers to someone who receives the action of the verb. In this sentence, it means "him," referring to an unspecified male person. * "il volto" is a direct object (accusative case) meaning "the face". It agrees with the verb form "vide". Overall, the sentence structure is correct, so I would say it's grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il sarto" means "the tailor", while "ha confezionato" means "has sewn". A more detailed translation would be "The tailor has sewn a linen suit." Both subject-verb agreement and word order follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "ha." Additionally, "edificato" matches the past participle agreement for regular -are verbs when used with auxiliary verb "avere". Lastly, all word order rules have been followed correctly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is the subject, "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "to be", "brutale" means cruel or harsh, and "con Alice" means with Alice. So, the complete sentence translates to "Andrea is cruel with Alice."
1	The sentence "Il Giappone colonizzò la Mancaurià" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Japan colonized Manchuria". Here, "Giappone" (Japan) is the subject which is singular and agrees with the verb form "colonizzò", past tense of "colonnaizare"(to colonize). Similarly, "Mancaura" (Manchuria) is also singular and agrees with the definite article "la". Therefore, I would say that the given sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" (subject) is singular and agrees with the verb "aveva ammassato" which is also in the singular form. Furthermore, "pacchetti" is correctly used as it follows the past tense verb and matches its plurality. Finally, "alla base della libreria" is an appropriate way to describe the location where Leo had stacked packages.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo aveva ammassato contro il muro" can be translated as "Leonardo had leaned against the wall." There doesn't seem to be any grammatical errors in it.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject, which agrees with the past tense verb form "ci aveva ammassato." Additionally, the direct object pronoun "ci," indicates movement towards or an action directed at something (in this case, the packages), so it is appropriate here. Therefore, no grammatical errors were detected.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'avaro" means "the miser", which is the subject here, and it agrees with the singular verb form "accumula". The word order is also correct for an Italian sentence, making this sentence acceptable in standard Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "è" (third person singular). The word "importante" correctly describes the subject. The phrase "per noi" shows that the speaker wants to emphasize or clarify who this important person is for - in this case, us.
1	The sentence "Il Sergente distribuisce le carte." is grammatically correct. In Italian, "il sergente" (the sergeant) is a masculine singular noun, so we use "distribuisce" which is the third person singular form of "distribuire" (to distribute). Furthermore, "le carte" (the cards) is a feminine plural noun that requires an article "le". So overall, it means "The sergeant distributes the cards", which makes sense in English as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Sofia separò il lavoro in due parti distinte" can be translated as "Sofia divided the work into two separate parts". The past tense verb form "separò" agrees with singular feminine subject "Sofia", while definite article "il" correctly precedes masculine noun "lavoro". Additionally, "due parti distinte" (two distinct parts) is properly used as an adverbial phrase indicating how the action was performed.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "carezzò". Additionally, "gli" is correctly used as an indirect object pronoun referring to "lui", and "il volto" refers to "his face".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Questa situazione" (this situation) is feminine singular, so it takes the third person singular verb form "complica". Therefore, "gli" (to him) agrees in gender and number with "situazione", making the entire sentence grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" (subject) grabbed "la mano di Lorenzo" (Lorenzo's hand). Both subject-verb agreement and word order follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Questa" means "this," "medicina" means "medicine," "coagula" is the third-person singular present tense form of the verb "coagulare," which means "to clot or coagulate," and "il sangue" means "the blood." So, the sentence translates to "This medicine coagulates the blood."
1	The sentence "Riccardo forgia l'acciaio" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo forges steel." In this sentence, the subject (Riccardo) agrees with the verb (forgia), making it grammatically acceptable.
0	In the given Italian sentence "Sofia cucina il pollo al limone", the verb form used with "il pollo" (indefinite article "the" chicken) should be "cuocono" instead of "cucina". This is because "il pollo" refers to third person masculine singular noun, which requires the -no ending in the present tense for verbs that end in -are like "cucinare." Therefore, the corrected version would be "Sofia cuoce il pollo al limone," meaning "Sofia cooks the lemon chicken."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le donne" means "the women," which is the subject of the sentence. "Partoriscono" is the third person plural form of the verb "partorire" (to give birth), agreeing with the plural subject "le donne." "I bambini" means "the children," who are the objects being given birth to by the women. So overall, the sentence translates to "The women give birth to the children" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "converte" agrees with it in number (both are singular). Additionally, the object "lo zucchero" correctly uses the masculine singular direct object pronoun "lo". Overall, the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules for word agreement and usage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il governo" (the government) is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "converte" (converts). The object of the sentence is "gli oppositori" (the opponents), which is in the accusative case and agrees with the verb. Overall, the word order and grammatical forms follow standard Italian syntax rules.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "travestì" does not agree with its subject "Alice." In French, past tense regular verbs ending in -er change their stem vowel from e to i when used with first person singular pronouns (je), second person informal singular pronouns (tu), third person singular masculine pronouns (il), and third person singular feminine pronouns (elle). However, it remains unchanged for all other subjects including first person plural pronouns (nous), second person formal singular or plural pronouns (vous), third person plural pronouns (ils) and (elles). Here, since the subject is "Alice," which is a third person singular feminine noun, the verb form must end in -it rather than -i. Therefore, the correct form would have been "Alica ne travaillait pas Francesco."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) released "il cane" (direct object). It follows the typical SVO structure of Italian sentences with proper agreement between subject and verb forms.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lo" refers to "la fiducia," which agrees with the masculine gender of the noun it replaces (fiducia). "Stato" is the subject, and "accorda" matches its singular form. "All'amministrazione pubblica" means "to the public administration." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "The State places too much trust in the public administration."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" (subject) attributed the decision to go to China to "Leonardo". It follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence where the subject comes before the verb. Additionally, the past tense form "attribuì" agrees with the masculine singular subject "Tommaso", which is also grammatically consistent.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "addebitava". Additionally, all words appear to be used correctly in their given tense and function within the context of the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco leaves his wife on the road." In this sentence, "Francesco" (the subject) is in singular form and agrees with the verb "abbandona" which is also in singular form. There is no grammatical error here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I ladri" means "the thieves", "rubano" means "they steal", "le auto" means "the cars", and "ai legittimi proprietari" means "from the legitimate owners". Therefore, the whole sentence translates as "The thieves steal the cars from the legitimate owners."
1	The sentence "Maria spalmò il pane con il coltello" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria spread the bread with the knife". Each word is correctly conjugated or chosen for its respective role in the sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it seems that "mise" (third person singular form) does not agree with its subject "Riccardo" (which is singular and requires the second person singular form "metti"). Also, "tavolo di cappello" doesn't make sense in Italian as it means "table of hat", which is ungrammatical and nonsensical. It could have been intended as "Riccardo mette il tavolo in cucina." meaning "Riccardo puts the table in kitchen".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'aviazione" means "the air force," "nemica" means "enemy," "bombardò" is the third-person singular past tense form of "to bomb," "napalm" refers to a type of incendiary gel used in bombs, and "sulla città" means "on the city." So, the entire sentence translates to "The enemy air force bombed napalm on the city."
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in Italian because "imbevere" means "to soak", but it cannot take a solid food such as bread as its direct object; also, wine bread does not exist. If you want to say that Andrea is eating normal bread while drinking wine, the sentence should be "Andrea sta mangiando il pane e bevendo del vino." or "Andrea beve vino mentre mangia il pane." (Andrea is eating bread and drinking wine / Andrea drinks wine while eating bread).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Rosso" agrees with "raso" in gender (both masculine) and number (singular), as it describes the fabric used to stuff ("foderare") the pillows ("cuscini").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject of the sentence, which is doing the action of scattering (disseminating) entertaining anecdotes (aneddoti divertenti) in his stories (nei suoi racconti).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I turisti" means "the tourists", which is the subject of the sentence. "Disseminano" is the third person plural form of the verb "disseminare," meaning "to scatter." So, "i turisti disseminano" can be translated as "the tourists scatter." Finally, "il prato" means "the lawn" or "the meadow," while "di cartacce" means "of litter" or "of paper scraps." Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "The tourists scatter the lawn with litter," which makes sense in English as well.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error where "dell'idea" should be replaced with "di essa (the idea)" or "del suo concetto (of his concept)" since it refers back to the feminine noun "l'idea." Additionally, "essere" should agree in number with its subject; therefore, it needs to be changed from singular ("è") to plural ("sono"). Here's the corrected version: Gabriele nutrì il figlio del suo concetto di essere i più bravi e intelligenti di tutti.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) released "il cane" (direct object) from "dalle catene" (indirect object). It follows the standard structure for an Italian sentence with a simple past tense verb: Subject-Verb-Object(s).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (subject) is performing an action ("scaricare") on "Giulia", who is affected by that action, hence the use of "dalle". It follows the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure with no apparent errors or typos.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" is the subject, "ne" is an adverb used here as a pronoun referring to something previously mentioned (in this case, freedom), "ottene" is the third person singular form of the verb "ottenere" which means "to obtain", and "la libertà" is the direct object which means "freedom". So, the translation would be: "Tommaso obtains it (the freedom)".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" (subject) is defending ("difende") "Giulia" from ("contro") the dangers ("i pericoli"). All words agree with each other in number and gender, making it a grammatically acceptable sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because in Italian, when talking about inanimate objects (like gold and lead), we use "deriva" instead of "fa derivare". Also, the verb "fare" requires the object pronoun "lo" before "oro", so the corrected sentence would be: "L'alchimista lo fa derivare dall'oro al piombo." This means "The alchemist turns gold into lead." However, without additional context it is unclear if that is what was intended.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (which is a masculine singular noun) matches with its corresponding verb form "spostò" which is also masculine singular in the past tense. Therefore, no grammatical errors were detected in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject of the sentence, which means "Leonard" in English. "pone" is the third person singular form of the verb "porre", meaning "to put". "il libro" is the direct object, which means "the book" in English. "sulla scrivania" is an adverbial phrase that tells us where Leonard puts the book - "on the desk". So overall, the translation would be something along the lines of "Leonard places the book on the desk."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (which is the subject) takes the third person singular verb form "prese", which corresponds to the past tense of "prendere" (to take). The direct object here is "il cappotto", so "l'armadio" must be an indirect object introduced by the preposition "dall'" (from the closet), where Alessandro took his coat from.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject of the sentence, which means "Gabriele" sent the receipt ("la ricevuta") to the tax office ("all'ufficio delle imposte"). The verb form "spedì" agrees with the singular masculine gender of the subject "Gabriele". Therefore, it does not contain any grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola pushed Francesco's legs towards the wall." In Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, so "le gambe" (the legs) comes before "di Francesco" (of Francesco). Also, word order can vary more freely in Italian than English, with subject-verb-object being only one possible option among many for expressing different meanings or emphasis.
1	The sentence "La foresteria ospita gli intervenuti alla manifestazione." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Foresteria" (forest house or guesthouse) is a feminine singular noun, so it requires an article that agrees with its gender ("la") and number (singular). * "Intervenuti" refers to people who have taken part in something, usually translated as "attendees" or "participants". It's also a masculine plural noun, which means you need to use "gli" before it since it follows a vowel sound. So everything checks out here!
1	The sentence "Il dottore spennella le tonsille di Gabriele di iodione" is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "il dottore" (the doctor) is the subject who performs an action on "le tonsille di Gabriele" (Gabriele's tonsils). Iodine is referred to as "iodione," which is its proper name in Italian pharmacology. Therefore, no corrections need to be made.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject who performed an action (archiviò) on the direct object ("la documentazione") which was placed into indirect object location ("nell'archivio centrale"). All words agree with each other in terms of number and gender, as required by Italian grammar rules.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "gomiti" (elbows) is plural, but it should be singular "gomito" since the verb "poggiano" agrees with the subject in singular form. A correct version would be "Il gomito poggia sul davanzale."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) "affoga" (verb) "i dispiaceri" (direct object) "nel vino" (prepositional phrase).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Un buon timoniere" means "a good helmsman," "attracca" is the third-person singular form of the verb "attaccare" (to attach), which agrees with the subject "un buon timoniere." "Rapidamente" means "quickly," and "la sua nave" means "his ship." Finally, "al molo" means "at the dock." Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "A good helmsman quickly attaches his ship to the dock" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is a singular third-person masculine subject that agrees with the simple past tense verb form "spostò", meaning "moved". Additionally, the prepositions used for location ("dal" and "sul") match their respective noun objects, which are also correctly gendered as "il tavolo" (masculine) and "il mobile" (masculine).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) is performing the action ("pompava") on "l'acqua" (direct object), moving it from "dal lago" (source location) to "alla piscina" (destination). There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make the sentence unacceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" and "Leonardo" are both masculine singular nouns, so using "e" (meaning "and") between them is appropriate. Both words agree with their adjective "negoziano," which also reflects masculine singular form. Lastly, "libertà" is a feminine singular noun that matches its definite article "la." Therefore, I can confirm that this sentence is indeed grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Una donna" (a woman) is singular and in feminine gender, which matches with the past tense form "aveva" (had). Also, "Andrea e Tommaso" are two male names connected by "e", so we use the masculine plural form "separato". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and "ricava danaro dalle sue applicazioni" is the verb phrase in which "ricava" agrees with the singular subject "Alessandro". The rest of the sentence follows naturally from the verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) is performing the action ("allontana") on "Maria" (direct object). In this case, it is not necessary to include "e" between the subject and direct object since they are both singular nouns. Additionally, "dalla stanza" correctly indicates that the action takes place away from the room.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Contare su qualcuno" means "to rely on someone," so the sentence can be translated as "Leonardo relies on Francesco." Both names are masculine singular in Italian, which matches the verb form used here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: - "Sofia" (a feminine noun) is the subject of the sentence. It agrees with the verb "confonde," which is also conjugated correctly for third person singular female form ("confonde"). - Both "il piacere" (masculine gender) and "la possibilità" (feminine gender) agree with their respective articles. - There is no grammatical error related to word order or tense. Therefore, we can conclude that the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Tommaso fondeva l'argento con l'oro." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "Tommaso" (which means Thomas) is the subject who was melting "l'argento" (silver) with "l'oro" (gold). This verb form "fondeva" agrees with the masculine singular subject Tommaso. Therefore, it does not require any grammatical correction.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is the subject of the sentence and "ci" refers to a group that includes the speaker (or reader). "Sostituisce" is the appropriate verb form for "Gabriele," who is doing the action of replacing something ("tubo catodico").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) is replacing ("le sostituisce") the cathode ray tube ("il tubo catodico"). This structure follows standard subject-verb-object word order, making it acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) is alternating between "Beatrice" and "Paola" (objects), which is expressed using "con" (with). All words used here are correctly inflected for number and grammatical gender where applicable.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it seems that it's missing a subject or an object. A more complete version could be "L'amore lega le persone" (Love binds people).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Dorme" is the third person singular form of the verb "dormire" (to sleep), so it agrees with the subject "Gabriele".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is a singular third-person feminine subject that takes the desired form of the verb. In English, we would translate it as "Maria wants a book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject that wants something (desidera) and what she wants is expressed by the subordinate clause introduced by "che". In this case, "il fatto che tu venga" refers to the fact or event that you come. Each word is correctly conjugated for its role in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" (subject) possesses "la possibilità" (the possibility), so "tiene" (has) is used correctly here as the verb for possession. Additionally, the subjunctive form "promuovano" indicates that someone else will do the action (promoting). Overall, the structure and grammar rules align with the language standards.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Giulia" is the subject who is abandoning "l'idea", which is correctly marked with the definite article "l'" since it refers to a specific idea. The conjugated verb form "abbandona" agrees with the singular third person feminine subject "Giulia". The subordinate clause "che vedrà Edoardo" contains the future tense of the verb "vedere" (to see), where "vedrà" is correctly conjugated for the third person masculine singular pronoun "Edoardo". Therefore, I would say that the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, when using the verb "essere" (to be) with multiple singular nouns or pronouns joined by "che" (that), each subject takes its own form of the verb in agreement with its gender and number. Here, since "Maria" is making a statement about only one person ("Francesco"), we use "è", which agrees with the singular masculine noun "Francesco".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject and she is taking an action (bada) on the fact that everything works perfectly (che tutto funzioni alla perfezione).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) approves that "Maria" (direct object) leaves ("parta" is the subjunctive form of the verb "partire").
0	In Italian, verbs must agree in number and person with their subject. Here, "Emma" is the subject, but the verb "dubita" does not match it in form (it should be "duba"). Additionally, "che Alice parta" seems to indicate that "Alice leaving" is being cast as the direct object of Emma's doubt, which doesn't make sense without additional context.
0	In Italian, adjectives must agree in number and gender with the noun they modify. Here, "angoscia" (anguish) does not match the masculine singular form that would be required for the name "Tommaso." It seems like you may want an -a at the end to make it feminine singular ("angoscia" becomes "angosciante"), or possibly add -i at the end (-i is used when referring to multiple people). Additionally, word order can vary between languages; here, in English we might say "Lorenzo's travel angsts Tommaso," but in many cases Italian follows subject-verb-object structure more closely than English does, which could affect how words are arranged in your sentences as well.
0	In this sentence, "Riccardo lo approva l'idea" is not grammatically correct. It seems that you wanted to say something like "Riccardo approves that idea," but in Italian it would actually translate as "Riccardo approva quell'idea." However, even with this correction, the second part of the sentence ("ciò") doesn't fit well here. You can use "ciò" when referring back to an entire previous statement or situation, so it might work in other contexts; however, without additional information, I cannot suggest a proper replacement for this instance.
0	In Italian, when using "il" or "lo" as a direct object pronoun, it must come before the verb. Therefore, "Edoardo lo approva il fatto che Maria canti." should be changed to "Edoardo lo approva che Maria canti." for grammatical correctness. Additionally, in modern Italian, reflexive pronouns (like "si") are used instead of personal pronouns (like "lo", "la", etc.) with impersonal expressions such as "il fatto che". So the corrected sentence could be "Edoardo si approva il fatto che Maria canti.", but without more context about what exactly Edoardo is approving, I can only say that putting "lo" between "approva" and "che" makes the sentence ungrammatical.
0	The verb "desideri" does not agree with its subject "tu." In informal Italian, it's common for people to use "ti +verb" in place of "voi + verb," but here it makes the sentence ungrammatical. A better option would be using "Vuoi che Sofia venga?" or "Ti piacerebbe se Sofia venisse?" depending on context.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "al" is used before masculine singular nouns, while "fumo" (smoke) is a masculine plural noun. It should be "ai fumi" instead. So the corrected sentence would be: "Riccardo va ai fumi."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Brama" means "craves" or "has a strong desire for," and it agrees with its singular subject "Alice." Therefore, no correction needs to be made.
0	In Italian, when using "a" after certain verbs (like "incoraggiare") to indicate encouragement towards an action or situation, you need to use the infinitive form of that verb. Therefore, it should be "a sposarsi" instead of "che si sposi". So, the corrected sentence would be: "Andrea incoraggia Maria a sposarsi."
1	The sentence "Il fatto che Emma parli allieta suo padre." is grammatically correct. It means "The fact that Emma speaks (third person singular present indicative) delights her father.", where "il fatto" refers to something specific being discussed. There seems to be no grammatical error in it.
1	The sentence "Andare al cinema infiamma Sofia" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence means "Going to the movies excites Sophia". However, it would be more common to say "Vado al cinema ed eccita Sofia" which means "I go to the movies and I excite Sophia."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La" refers to direct object pronoun (her or it), "colpisce" means strikes or affects, "che" is used as relative pronoun here, "Riccardo" is subject and "rida" is third person singular form of verb ridere which means laughs. So overall the sentence can be translated as "It affects her that Riccardro laughs".
1	The sentence "Mi meraviglia il fatto che Beatrice sia svestita." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I am surprised by the fact that Beatrice is undressed.", where "mi" refers to the speaker, "meraviglia" means surprise, "il fait" (with an accent on the last i) means the fact, and "Beatrice" is the subject. "Sia svestita" is in the third person singular conjugated form for present tense, which agrees with "Beatrice". Overall, it seems you have provided a grammatically correct sentence as per my instructions! Great job!
0	In Italian, subject pronouns are generally omitted because the verb form itself indicates the person and number of the subject. However, when two or more nouns or pronouns have the same function in the sentence (in this case both being the subject), only one of them can be dropped. Therefore, the correct version of the sentence would be "Leonardo e Mario allietano Leonardo perché Maria ride" ("Leonardo and Mario make Leonardo happy because Maria is laughing").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La tristezza" (sadness) and "la noia" (boredom) are feminine singular nouns that both take the article "la." Together with the verb "deprimere" (to depress), they agree in number and gender with the subject "Gabriele," which is also third person singular. Therefore, the use of "e" as a conjunction between "tristezza" and "noia" is appropriate since it connects two feminine singular nouns. Overall, the sentence structure and grammar rules follow standard practices for forming an acceptable sentence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Mi acquieta" means "it calms me down," and "che Giulia parli in questo modo" means "that Julia speaks in this way." So overall, it says "It calms me down that Julia speaks in this way." There doesn't seem to be any grammatical errors here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La sola presenza" means "the only presence", referring to Alice. "Mi acquieta" means "calms me down". So the whole sentence means "The only presence of Alice calms me down."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Parlare" means "to speak," "con" means "with," "le" is an article that agrees with "ballerine," which means "dancers." Therefore, the whole sentence translates to "Speaking with the dancers is fun."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Io" (I) comes before the verb "vengo" (come), which agrees with the subject "io." "Edoardo" is correctly capitalized as it is a proper noun. Additionally, the preposition "di" followed by the article "poesia" indicates that the speaker is interested in the topic of poetry.
0	In Italian, when using the verb "vedere" (to see) in the passato prossimo tense with the subject "io", it requires the auxiliary verb "ho". However, in this case, the subject is "Paola", which requires the auxiliary verb "è". Additionally, the direct object "i marziani" needs to come before the conjugated form of the verb. A correct version would be: "Di marziani visti, ne è successo a Paola."
0	The verb "splendeva" (which means "was shining") does not agree in number with its subject "il suo sguardoo" ("his/her gaze"), which is singular. Since "aver vinto al lotto" ("having won the lottery") refers to one person, the correct form of the verb would be "splende". However, it still sounds unnatural as people don't usually shine from winning the lottery; perhaps you meant something else?
0	This sentence contains an agreement error between the past participle "diviso" (won) and the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have). In Italian, when using "avere," the past participle must agree in gender and number with the subject. However, in this case, the past participle appears as "diviso," which does not match any of the possible masculine singular forms ("dato," "detto," etc.). It seems that the intended form for a feminine singular subject would be "divisa." Therefore, since the subject of the sentence consists of two women, "Masha e Maria," it requires a plural form of the past participle such as "vinti." A corrected version could read: "Di aver vinto al lotto **splendevano** nel loro sguardo."
0	The verb "trattare" requires that its subject be in the third person singular or plural form, but here we have "si," which is used for first-person plural reflexive verbs. Therefore, the correct form would be "Ci tratteggiamo che dobbiamo fuggire."
0	The sentence "Si tratta di fuggire" is incomplete and lacks context for proper grammatical evaluation. However, even with an assumed context, it would still likely be considered grammatically incorrect due to its ambiguity and the absence of necessary components such as a subject or object.
1	The sentence "Il fatto che Emma sia uscita così presto denota che in questo momento non va d'accordo con te." is grammatically correct. It means "The fact that Emma left so early indicates that she isn't getting along with you at the moment." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Io condanno il fatto che Erod**i** (not Erode) uccisero (not uccise) i bambini." This is because the subject of the verb "uccidere" in the dependent clause is "Erodi," which requires the use of the third-person plural form of the verb, "uccisero." Additionally, "Erode" must agree with its corresponding pronoun, so we need to change "Erode" to "Erodi".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject which means he is the one who performs the action (adora), while "Andrea" is the object receiving the action (carezzare). Both verbs match with the singular masculine subject "Gabriele". Therefore, no grammatical errors found here.
1	The sentence "Andrea intende sposare Alice" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea plans to marry Alice." Both the subject (Andrea) and the verb tense (intende) agree with each other, as well as the object (Alice). Therefore, no corrections need to be made to the original sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) avoids watching "televisione" (direct object). It follows the standard SOV word order for transitive verbs with direct objects marked by an accusative case ending or an article.
0	The sentence contains two errors. Firstly, "si" should not be used with the verb "partire", only "parte". Secondly, the subject "Paola" requires that the verb conjugation agree in singular form, but "è carino" is the third-person plural form. It should be "Paola ritiene che parte sia carina."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo riteneva Alice fosse Paola" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo believed Alice was Paola". In this sentence, "riteneva" (believed) is used as the past tense form of the verb "ritenere" (to believe), while "Alice" and "Paola" are both feminine nouns that can function as either singular subjects or objects. Here, they serve as the direct object and subject complement, respectively. Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
0	In Italian, when using "che" as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause, the verb in the main clause (in this case, "giudica") must agree with the subject in number and gender, while the verb in the subordinate clause ("ha," meaning "has") agrees with its own subject ("Maria"). Therefore, since "Beatrice" is singular and feminine, the verb in the main clause should also reflect that by being the third person singular feminine form, which is "giudica". However, here we see "lo", which would only make sense if the subject was masculine singular. So, the sentence should read either "Beatricelo giudica che Maria ha troppe amanti." or "Beatrice la giudica che Maria ha troppi amanti.", depending on what you want to express about Maria's lovers - plural for many or masculine plural respectively.
0	In this sentence, "Sofia" is the subject and the verb that corresponds to it should be in third person singular form. However, the verb "giudica" is in third person singular form already, but since "che Maria abbia troppe amiche" is a subordinate clause with its own subject ("Maria"), the verb inside the subordinate clause needs to agree with its subject too. Thus, it should be "Maria abbia **troppi** amici", not "*troppe*".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Giulia" (subject) is third person singular, so the verb form "giudica" agrees with it. Also, the subjunctive form "sia" is used correctly for the subject "Maria", which indicates that someone else (in this case, Giulia) thinks or believes something about her.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" (subject) thinks that his father drinks too much ("il padre beve troppo"). The use of pronouns and verbs agrees with the subject-verb agreement rule in Italian grammar.
0	The verb "penso" does not agree in number with its subject "io". It should be changed to "penso" if the subject were singular, but since the subject here is "Io e te" (I and you), which is two people, the verb must also reflect that. Therefore, it should be "Pensiamo qualcosa di te."
0	In Italian, when using the verb "penso" (I think), it must agree in number with the subject. In this case, since the subject is "io" (I) which is singular, the second person pronoun "te" (you informal) should use the corresponding singular form of the verb for "you", which is "ami". However, in the given sentence, the verb used after "te" is still in its third-person singular form ("ama"), causing an agreement error between the subject and the verb. Therefore, the corrected version would be "Io penso che tu ami il tartufo."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" is a third-person singular feminine subject that matches with the verb "ottenere". The verb conjugates as "ottiene", which agrees with both the number (singular) and gender (feminine) of the subject. Therefore, no correction is needed for this sentence.
0	The sentence "Alice lavora a cacciare Maria" is incorrect in standard Italian grammar. It would need to be either "Alice sta cercando di catturare Maria" (Alice is trying to capture Maria) or "Alice lavora come cacciatrice e oggi deve catturare Maria" (Alice works as a hunter and today she must capture Maria), depending on the intended meaning. In both cases, proper verb forms are used according to their subject-verb agreement rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) applauds the fact that "Tommaso" (direct object) won. There is no need for any additional words or changes to make it grammatically acceptable.
0	The sentence "Maria ci aspira" is grammatically incorrect in Italian because it lacks a clear object that Maria aspires to. Additionally, the pronoun "ci" usually indicates a indirect or reflexive object, but neither is specified in the sentence. A more complete version could be "Maria ci aiuta", meaning "Maria helps us".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" refers to one person, so it takes the singular form of the reflexive pronoun "ci", which corresponds to third person feminine singular (lei). Therefore, "Maria ci si aggrappa" means "Maria clings to herself."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola hopes that the future will be happy." In Italian, it's common to use the present tense (in this case, "mira" which corresponds to English "hopes") when expressing future events with an implied time frame or context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Giulia" is a singular third-person feminine subject which matches with the verb form "guardava", meaning was looking at or watched. In addition, "il muro" means "the wall," which is in agreement with the verb tense used here. Therefore, it is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Riccardo lo pensa Tommaso" is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "lo" is a direct object pronoun that refers to a masculine singular noun. Here, it likely refers to an implied word such as "questa cosa" (this thing) or something similar. So, the translation would be "Riccardo thinks about it, Tommaso does too." Both verbs agree with their respective singular subjects ("Riccardo", "Tommaso") in number and gender.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks the subject-verb agreement. The verb "leggono" (third person plural) does not agree with its subject "Paola" (third person singular). It should be "Paola accetta di essere letta." or "Paola accetta che la leggano.", depending on what you want to convey.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alice" is the subject and she is smiling ("sorride") at something specific, which is the fact that she cried ("del fatto di aver pianto").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La condizione di disagio" means "The condition of discomfort," and "nasce dalla mancanza d'acqua" means "it originates from the lack of water." Together they form a complete thought that makes sense.
0	The sentence "Da quest'analisi risulta il nostro partire" is not grammatically correct in Italian. The problem lies with the phrase "il nostro partire," which is incorrect for two reasons. First, when referring to an action performed by multiple people (in this case, indicated by "nostro"), you need to use the reflexive pronoun that agrees in number with the subject. In this case, since the subject is plural ("noi" or "we"), the appropriate reflexive pronoun would be "ci." Second, even if we were to fix the agreement issue using the singular form "mio" or "tuo," it still wouldn't work as "partire" doesn't take an article before it. Therefore, the corrected version should read: "Da questa analisi risultiamo noi partiti."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La tosse" means "the cough", while "dipendere da" can be translated as "to depend on". Hence, the whole sentence could be translated as "The cough depends on having smoked too much." Both the subject-verb agreement (la tosse - dipende) and use of subjunctive mood after "dipende da" follow the rules of Italian grammar.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "Paola" needs to come before the verb "chiarische" in order for the direct object to appear before the verb (Y-movement). Additionally, since "Leonardo" is the subject of the embedded clause introduced by "che", it requires the third person singular form of the verb, which is "chiarisce". So the corrected sentence would be: "Leonardo chiarisce che non è colpa sua a lei."
0	The sentence "Andrea fischia a Maria che ha fame." is incorrect in Italian because it implies that only Maria is hungry when in fact, according to contextual usage, both Andrea and Maria are hungry. A more accurate translation would be "Andrea e Maria stanno facendo surf e hanno entrambi fame" (in English: "Andrea and Maria are surfing and they are both hungry").
0	The verb "accennerà" does not agree with its subject "Andrea". Since "Andrea" is singular, the verb form must also be singular, so it should be "accernerà" instead of "accennerà". Also, in Italian, we usually use the conditional tense after "se", so the second part of the sentence might need revision as well. It could be something like: "Andrea accentuerà verso Edoardo se parte o no."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" (the subject) agrees with the verb form "addebita" (third person singular), so that is consistent. Additionally, "Leonardo" as an indirect object requires "a", which is present here. Finally, while "ora" usually means "now," it can also mean "at the moment" or "by now." So "che ora ha fame" could mean something like "that he is hungry at the moment" or even "that by now he is hungry."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject, "lo" refers to something previously mentioned that is masculine singular (in this case it seems implied from context), "aggiunge" means adds, "nel" is short for "nella," which means in the + feminine singular nouns ending with -a or -e, and "suo" means his. So overall, the translation would be something along the lines of "Riccardo adds it in his speech."
1	The sentence "Maria ce lo ha scommesso" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here, "ce" is an indirect object pronoun that refers back to a preceding verb or preposition, while "lo" is a direct object pronoun referring to a masculine singular noun. In this case, it might refer to something implied earlier in conversation. So, no grammatical error exists in the given sentence.
1	The sentence "The journalists attack on the newspapers the fact that many politicians are corrupt" is grammatically correct in English, although it could flow better with some rephrasing (for instance, "The journalists attack newspapers for the fact that many politicians are corrupt"). However, without knowing the original language or context, it's difficult to say for sure if the grammar is correct according to its intended language. But as an English-language sentence, it seems fine.
1	The sentence "Paola incoraggia il fatto che i ragazzi vadano al mare." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola encourages the fact that the boys go to the sea". Each word is correctly conjugated for the subject and tense used.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" (subject) is followed by the verb "ne avvisa" (informs about it), and "Alessandro" (indirect object) comes last. It would only be incorrect if the subject were plural, which requires the use of "li" or "le" instead of "ne".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject and the direct object is "lo," which refers to "sciopero." It means "Gabriele convinces him that the strike is right."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it appears that "esime" should actually be "esimo," which means "tenth." However, even with this correction, the sentence would still not make sense in Italian as written without additional context. It seems to be missing some information or have an unusual structure. Additionally, since Riccardo is a single person, his name does not need to be repeated before and after "dal viaggio." A more natural way to express something similar might be "Riccardo si è assentato per il decimo giorno del viaggio" (Riccardo took a tenth-day absence from the trip).
0	The sentence "Il sindaco esenta i poveri dal pagare il bus" contains an agreement error between the subject ("il sindaco", meaning 'the mayor') and the verb tense used in the sentence. In Italian, when using the present tense with third-person singular subjects (like "il sindaco"), you need to use "-a" or "-e" as the ending for regular verbs. However, the verb "esentare" requires "-a" at the end only for first conjugation (-ARE) verbs, so it must agree with the plural noun "i poveri". Therefore, the correct form would be "esentano" instead of "esenta": Correct version: Il sindaco esenta **gli** *poveri* **dal** *pagare* **il** *bus*. (The mayor exempts THE POOR from paying for the BUS.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" and "Leonardo" are both singular subjects and they agree with their respective verbs in number. Also, "si accorda" (agrees) requires that its subject agrees with the verb "sia" (is). Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Alice discorre di partire con Giulia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alice talks about leaving with Julia.", where both names are feminine singular. Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in the given sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria si accorge" means "Mary realizes", where "si" functions as a reflexive pronoun indicating that the subject performs an action on herself. "Di essere innamorata" is the infinitive form of the verb phrase meaning "to be in love". "Dal fatto di arrossire" can be translated as "because of blushing", with "di" being used here as a preposition introducing the reason for Maria's realization. Hence, the overall structure of the sentence remains coherent throughout.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject and "continua a mangiarlo" means "continues to eat it". Therefore, the verb "continua" agrees with its singular subject "Edoardo", making the sentence grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lo" is used as an indirect object pronoun for masculine singular nouns, referring back to "Leonardo." It can translate to English as "He indulges him (Leonardo) in eating."
0	In present tense in Italian, third person singular verbs require an -O ending (e.g., "osa" for "he eats"). However, the subject here is "Edoardo", which is a masculine singular noun requiring an -A ending on the verb in its corresponding conjugation. Therefore, it should be "Edoardo osa".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is a singular feminine noun that means "Paula". "È" is an auxiliary verb meaning "is", which agrees with the subject "Paola" in number (singular) and gender (feminine). "Capace" is an adjective agreeing with the subject in gender and number, meaning "capable". Finally, "di" introduces the infinitive phrase "cavalcare", which means "to ride". So the whole sentence translates as "Paula is capable of riding."
1	The sentence "Maria ha l'intenzione di cavalcare." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria intends to ride (something)." In this case, "cavalcare" requires an object which could be something like a horse or bike, but it isn't specified here.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "suole" (wears) does not agree with its subject "Tommaso" in number. It should be changed to "suola" for third person singular. Also, "il pasto" means "the meal", which doesn't seem quite right here as it refers to what Tommaso wears. Perhaps you meant something else?
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (the subject) must match with the third person singular verb form "deve". In addition, the direct object pronoun "lo" agrees in gender and number with its antecedent ("it"). Therefore, no grammatical error was found here.
0	The sentence "Gabriele usa mangiarlo" is grammatically incorrect in Italian. It seems that the verb "mangiare" (to eat) was included unnecessarily here. A possible correction could be "Gabriele lo usa," which means "Gabriele uses it." However, without context, I can only assume what the intended meaning might have been.
1	The sentence "Riccardo va in camera" is grammatically correct. It means "Riccardo goes to the bedroom." In Italian, when talking about actions performed by singular third-person subjects (in this case, "Riccardo"), you do not need to add an ending to the verb as long as the subject is clear from context or explicitly mentioned beforehand.
0	The sentence "Andrea sale in camera" is incorrect because it seems that you are trying to say that Andrea is selling something (using the verb "sale," which is not a standard English form), but the word "in" does not make sense in this context. Additionally, the Italian word "camera" does not fit here as an English noun would be expected. A possible corrected version could be "Andrea sells cameras."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here, "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence which means "Riccardo disappears from Paris". Each word is correctly conjugated according to their grammatical role in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject and "parte" is the verb in its third person singular form (present tense), which agrees with the subject "Edoardo". The destination "a Parigi" means "to Paris", so the complete translation would be "Edoardo leaves for Paris."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola walks toward the bridge." In Italian, when the verb follows the subject and both the subject and object are singular, you don't need to use an article before the object as it is implied.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La folla" means "the crowd", "lo" is used as an indirect object pronoun referring to "him", and "corre" is the third person singular form of the verb "to run". Therefore, "La folla lo corre a salutare." can be translated as "The crowd runs to greet him."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" (subject) is sending ("invia") "Emma" (direct object) to "piazza" (indirect object). All verbs and nouns agree in number and gender, so no grammatical errors can be found.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Beatrice" is the subject, and "assembla" means "assembles." The object of the sentence is "un computer," which means "a computer." So, the sentence can be translated into English as "Beatrice assembles a computer," which makes sense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il film" means "the movie," and "è di Scorsese" translates to "is by Scorsese." So, the whole sentence can be translated as "The movie is by Scorsese", which is grammatically correct in English too.
1	The sentence "Paola lavora" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola works". The subject-verb agreement is consistent as "lavora" (works) matches with its singular subject "Paola".
0	In Italian, adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. Here, "quel" (that) does not match the feminine singular form that it should take since "quadro" is masculine singular. It should be "quello." Also, when using the definite article before the possessive adjective, we use an apostrophe after the article only for singular nouns; therefore, "quel suo" would be more appropriate than "quel sua". However, even without the error mentioned above, "sua" or "suo" might still sound unnatural here as per standard Italian usage, so one could consider rephrasing the whole expression slightly differently: "È l’amica che angoscia Emma con quel quadro di Picasso."
1	The sentence "Molte loro leggono il giornale." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Molte" means many in English, so it refers to multiple people (feminine gender). * "Loro" is used as both subject and object pronoun for third-person plural in Italian. It can refer to either male or female individuals. In this case, since "molte" indicates that we're talking about females, "loro" represents them correctly. * "Leggono" is the third-person plural form of the verb "leggere," which means to read. * Finally, "il giornale" means the newspaper. Therefore, the whole sentence translates into "Many of them read the newspaper," making it grammatically acceptable in Italian.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "architetto" should be "architetti." In Italian, professional roles (like architect) take on an "-i" ending when referring to more than one person.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject and "mangia" means "eats". Therefore, it can be translated as "Paola eats (the) pizza."
0	In Italian, adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. In this case, "alcuni" (some) is modifying "progetti" (projects), which is plural and masculine. However, the form used here is "alcuno", which does not match the gender or number of "projettti". Therefore, the correct form would be "Quell'architetto ha alcuni progetti **di** musei."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere", which means "have". It agrees with its subject "molte ragazze", meaning "many girls", in number (plural) and gender (feminine). So, the use of "hanno" here is appropriate.
1	The sentence is correct. In Italian, adjectives often agree with the noun they modify in gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). However, "spalle" which means "shoulders" is already plural so the adjective "toccano" that means "touch" correctly agrees with it. Also, the verb must agree with the subject, here "Riccardo", which is singular masculine and the verb "toccanon" also agrees with it in number and person. Good job!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sarà" agrees with the subject "Maria", indicating that she will be affected by that movie.
0	In Italian, the verb form must agree with the subject in number and person. Here, "che tu" (that you) is the subject but it uses the singular form while it should use the plural form as it refers to two people (Masha and Jane). Also, the verb "essere" (to be) should be used after "tu". Therefore, the sentence should be "Che voi siate partite rallegri Beatrice." or "Siete partite, il che rallegra Beatrice.", depending on what is intended to express.
1	The sentence "Gabriele è il marito di Paola." is grammatically correct. It means "Gabriele is Paola's husband" in English. In Italian, the verb "essere" (to be) agrees with the subject in gender and number. Here, the subject "Gabriele" is singular and masculine, so the form "è" is used correctly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, "Beatrice" is a third-person singular feminine subject, and "è" (is) agrees with it. Similarly, "con Lorenzo" means "with Lorenzo," which is an appropriate way to express accompaniment or association in Italian. Therefore, the whole sentence translates as "Beatrice is with Lorenzo."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola ha messo la macchina che è del fratello nel garage" can be translated as "Paola put the car that belongs to her brother in the garage." Each word is correctly conjugated or used with respect to its role in the sentence.
0	The sentence "Tommaso obbedisce di Maria" is not grammatically correct in Italian. It seems that you want to say something along the lines of "Tommaso obeys Mary." If so, it would translate as "Tommaso ubbidisce a Maria" in Italian. The issue with the original phrase includes word order (the preposition "di" is misplaced) and verb agreement (obbedisce requires a singular subject).
0	The sentence is incorrect because it contains two instances of "Andrea" as subject and object of the preposition "con," which can lead to confusion. It would be better to use different names or pronouns for the subject and object. For instance, "Andrea confronta Leonardo con Maria."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" (subject) is followed by the third person singular form of the verb "fotografare", which agrees with the subject in number and gender. "Paola" is the object of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo è stato smanioso" is grammatically correct in Italian. "Smanioso" means eager or impatient, and it agrees with the masculine singular subject "Lorenzo". The auxiliary verb "è stato" also agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the subject "Lorenzo". Therefore, no corrections need to be made to the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tua sorella" means "your sister," "guarda" is the third-person singular form of the verb "to watch," and "il gelato" means "the ice cream." So the whole sentence can be translated as "Your sister watches the ice cream."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tua sorella" means "your sister," "guarda" is the third-person singular form of the verb "to watch," and "il CD" means "the CD." So the whole sentence means "Your sister watches the CD."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sofia cut off the buffalo's head" in English. The subject-verb agreement is correct as "ha tagliato" (third person singular) agrees with the singular subject "Sofia". Additionally, the past tense is used correctly here.
1	The sentence "Sofia ha tagliato la testa al toro." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "ha" is the third person singular form of the verb "avere," which means "to have." It agrees with the subject "Sofia" who performed the action. The phrase "la testa" refers to "the head" while "al toro" refers to "to the bull." Therefore, "Sofia ha tagliato la testa al toro" translates to "Sofia cut off the head of the bull."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I ragazzi" (the boys) is the subject and it agrees with the verb form "taglierebbero" (would cut). It follows the standard rules for using congiuntivo presente tense, which is used here to express hypothetical or uncertain actions in the past.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "È il toro che Maria ha preso per le corna e non il bufalo" translates to "It is the bull that Maria grabbed by the horns and not the buffalo." Both clauses in this sentence follow proper Italian grammar rules for subject-verb agreement, verb tense, word order, and noun-adjective agreements.
0	The sentence "Maria stende il bucato" is incorrect because it implies that Maria is doing laundry on something (il bucato = the laundry). Instead, she should be doing laundry to something. Therefore, the correct form would be "Maria sta stirando i panni" or "Maria stira i vestiti".
1	The sentence "Il mio amico abbaia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "My friend barks" in English. Here, "il mio amico" (my friend) is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "abbaia" (barks). Therefore, it's grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ulula" (Riccardo howls) is grammatically correct in Italian. It consists of a proper noun "Riccardo", which is the subject of the sentence, followed by a verb "ulula" (howls), which agrees with the singular masculine subject. Therefore, no correction is needed for this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Dormì" is the past tense singular form of the verb "dormire", which means "to sleep". So the sentence translates as "Gabriele slept."
1	The sentence "Il cane si è fermato in un battito di occhio." is grammatically correct. This Italian sentence translates to "The dog stopped in the blink of an eye" in English. Here, "si" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject "il cane", which means "the dog". The phrase "in un battito di occhio" is an idiomatic expression meaning "in no time at all" or "very quickly". Therefore, it is grammatically acceptable to use "si" after the verb "è" (third person singular form of "essere," meaning "to be") as it agrees with the gender and number of the noun "cane".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject of the first clause, and he is doing the action of "ha messo", which means "has put". In the second clause, "ci" refers back to "Edoardo" as the indirect object, and "due ore" is the duration it took for him to complete the action of cutting the electrical wire, expressed by the verb phrase "tagliare il filo elettrico."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "ha sezionato". The object of the sentence is "il vecchio tiglio", and everything else follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le sei bombe" (the six bombs) is the subject, which agrees with the verb "sono esplose" (have exploded). The date "il 6 maggio 1999" specifies when the explosion occurred.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Lorenzo" is the subject and he is negating the habit of smoking using "non" before the verb "ha". He is also expressing that he no longer has this habit by adding "più" after the verb but before "l'abitudine", which means "the habit". Finally, he specifies what habit it is with "di fumare", meaning "of smoking". All in all, everything follows proper Italian grammar rules for word order, conjugations, and tenses.
0	The sentence "Andrea è diventato in gamba" is incorrect because it uses the masculine singular form "è" for the verb "diventare," but the subject "Andrea" is already masculine singular. However, the phrase "in gamba" doesn't seem to fit syntactically or semantically with the rest of the sentence. It would help if you could provide more context about what you want to convey so I can give a better response.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso ha fatto gli auguri a Giulia" can be translated as "Tommaso gave (the) wishes to Julia". Here, "ha fatto" is in past tense which means "gave", "agli" is a contraction of "a i" where "i" refers to indirect object pronoun for singular masculine, but since it comes after "a" (which also means "to"), we use "gli" instead. Hence, the translation provided above fits perfectly with the given Italian sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sofia" is asking ("chiede") that you ("tu") return ("torni") immediately.
0	In the sentence "Che tu vada via dispiace a Beatrice," the verb form "vada" does not agree with its subject "tu." It should be "Vai via" for second person singular. Also, it would sound more natural to say "Dispiacerebbe a Beatrice che tu te ne andassi" or something similar that conveys the intended meaning more clearly in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I bambini" means "the children," which is plural and matches with the verb form "hanno." "Hanno calpestato" translates to "they have trampled," and "le aiuole" refers to "the flower beds." Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "The children have trampled the flower beds."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "bambini" is plural in form but it agrees with the third person singular verb "eruttò." It should be "eruttarono" to match the subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. Therefore, the corrected sentence is "I bambini eruttarono lava."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Quell'uomo" (that man) is the subject of the first clause and agrees with the singular verb "ha fotografato" (has photographed). "L'unico testimone" (the only witness) is the object of the first clause and agrees with the masculine gender and singular number of the noun it refers to. In English, both objects and subjects can follow verbs; in Italian, as in many other languages, they generally precede them. The second clause begins with an expletive "ci," which serves no syntactic purpose but signals that what follows ("è avvenuto") happened somewhere or somehow—a kind of grammatical placeholder. Finally, "un mese fa" means "a month ago." Overall, the structure may seem complicated for non-native speakers due to its complex morphological system and free word order, but all elements here conform to standard Italian syntax rules.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks information about what the man photographed (ne ha fotografato cosa?). It could be corrected by adding an object, for example "Quell'uomo ha fotografato un gatto." which means "That man photographed a cat."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "ha carezzato", meaning "has caressed". "Il volto di Beatrice" means "Beatrice's face". So, the entire sentence translates as "Andrea has caressed Beatrice's face."
1	The sentence "Il volto di Paola è carezzato." is grammatically correct. In this Italian sentence, "il volto" means "the face", "di" means "of", "Paola" is the subject, "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere" (to be), and "carezzato" is the past participle of the verb "carezzare" (to caress). Therefore, when translated into English it says "Paola's face was caressed.", which makes sense in proper usage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject that has performed an action (ha fratturato) on Mario's arm (il braccio di Maria). It follows the standard form for expressing actions in Italian with a single third-person singular subject.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" (subject) is singular and uses the third person singular verb form "ha paralizzato" which matches with the past participle "paralizzato". "Il braccio di Maria" means "Mary's arm", so overall it translates to "Leonardo has paralyzed Mary's arm."
1	The sentence "Il bambino pesava nove chili a pochi mesi." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "il bambino" means "the baby", "pesava" is the third person singular form of the verb "pesare" (to weigh), which agrees with the subject "bambino". "Nove chili" is nine kilograms and "a pochi mesi" refers to a few months old. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "The baby weighed nine kilos after just a few months."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gli" is a proper form of the definite article for masculine singular nouns that are preceded by a vowel or the silent "h". In this case, it agrees with the subject "gli operai", which is also masculine plural. Therefore, no correction is needed.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola elencò l'invitato" can be translated as "Paola listed the guest". There might be a missing word in the English translation since it seems strange that one would list just one guest unless they were using the singular form as an abstract noun referring to guests in general or listing qualities of a single guest. But regardless, the Italian syntax itself is fine.
0	In this sentence, "ha" does not agree with the subject "Alice e ciò", which requires the use of "hanno". Additionally, "ciò" cannot be used as a substitute for an object in this way - it would need to be replaced by the actual object or objects being referred to. Also, "nell'armadio" needs to come before "e ciò è accaduto". A possible correction could be: "Alice e quegli oggetti hanno posizionato i vestiti nella armadio."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject who removed her clothes ("i vestiti" refers to clothing in general), and "ciò" (which means "this" or "that") refers back to whatever event happened in the closet. It might help to imagine that the full sentence could read something like "Maria ha tolto i vestiti ed ecco che ciò è accaduto nell'armadio," which would translate as "Maria took off her clothes, and lo and behold, it happened in the closet."
0	In Italian, articles must agree with both the gender and number of the noun they precede. Here, "frutta" (fruit) is feminine plural, so it requires an article such as "la" or "le". Therefore, the sentence "Beatrice riempie il frigo con frutta." is not grammatically correct. It should be "Beatrice riempie il frigo con la frutta.", where "la frutta" means "the fruit".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" (subject) is defending "Andrea" (direct object) from "pericoli" (indirect object). No grammatical errors were found in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Il libro passa da Maria a Maria" is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "The book passes from Maria to Maria." Since both instances of Maria refer to the same person (Maria), it is acceptable to use the singular feminine form of the article ("da") before each name. Additionally, since books are typically referred to with masculine gender articles, "libro" is used here correctly as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" (subject) gives "a book" ("un libro", direct object) to "Paola". In Italian, when you have a pronoun as subject followed by a verb, you don't need to use another pronoun before the verb, so it's not necessary to say "Lei da" but just "dà".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (masculine singular) is the subject who is delegating someone, while "suo rappresentante" (his representative) refers to Gabriele. So it means "Francesco designates Gabriele as his representative."
0	In Italian, when using an indirect object pronoun (such as "sua" in this case), it needs to agree with its corresponding noun or pronoun in gender and number. Here, since "Maria" is feminine singular, the possessive adjective "sua" must also be feminine singular ("sua", not "come"). Additionally, according to standard Italian grammar, the preposition "a" followed by a name indicating the indirect object can sometimes be omitted, but only when referring to people that have already been mentioned before; therefore, here we need to include it. So, the corrected sentence would be: "Sofia la delega a Maria come sua rappresentante".
0	In Italian, the pronoun "ciò" (it) requires the use of the singular verb form, but in this case, the verb "succedere" is used in its third person plural form ("succede") which would agree with a plural subject. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect. It should be "Lorenzo abita e ciò succede a Roma." corrected as "Lorenzo abita ed esso accade a Roma.", where "esso" agrees with "ciò".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo ha mangiato la pizza e ciò è successo al ristorante" can be translated as "Riccardo ate the pizza and that happened at the restaurant." Each part of this compound sentence (two independent clauses connected by "e") has a subject ("Riccardo" and "ciò", which refers back to something previously mentioned) and a verb in past tense ("ha mangiato" and "è successo").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sofia" is the subject, "fuma" means "smokes," and "una bionda" means "a blonde (cigarette)." So the entire sentence translates to "Sofia smokes a blonde cigarette."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) uses "ha" for the third person singular present tense of "avere" which means "to have". Then it continues with "spalmato", past participle of "spalmare" meaning "to spread". So overall, "Edoardo has spread the paste on bread."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is a singular third-person subject that requires "ha" (the third person singular form of "avere," meaning "has") for tense agreement. "Spalmato" correctly agrees with its singular masculine direct object "il pane." So, no grammatical errors found here!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The bombs were raining down on us." In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, third). Here, the verb "piovevano" (the third-person plural form of "piovere", meaning "to rain") agrees with its plural subject "le bombe".
0	The sentence is incorrect because "matrimoni" (marriages) is plural, but the verb "funzionano" (work, function) agrees with a singular subject. It should be "funziona" instead. A corrected version would be: "I matrimonio misto funziona in modo perfetto."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La tua idea" means "your idea", while "equivale" is the third person singular form of the verb "equivalere" (to equal). Therefore, the subject of the sentence must be third person singular as well, which it is - "la mia" means "my". So, both the grammatical structure and the agreement between subject and verb are consistent with each other in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La tua idea" means "your idea", while "la mia" means "mine". Together they mean "your idea and mine". The verb "equivalgono" correctly matches with two feminine singular nouns. Therefore, the overall structure and grammar of the sentence are correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject in singular form and it agrees with the verb "gira", which is also in its third person singular present tense form ("gira"). Additionally, the preposition "per" followed by the article "la" before the noun "città" indicates that the action (turning) occurs around or throughout the city, not inside it. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Edoardo turns through the city".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia returns from Milan to Naples." There are no apparent grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make it unsuitable for conversation or writing.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo controlla Paola" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo checks Paola". Both verbs "controllare" (to check) and "checks" agree with their subject "Lorenzo", which is singular masculine in form. Similarly, the object "Paola" matches its verb ending. Therefore, it is grammatically acceptable.
0	In Italian, when using "acconsentire" (to agree), it requires that the subject agrees with both the verb tense and number. In this case, "Maria" is singular while "la figlia" is also feminine but plural. Therefore, you would need two separate verbs for each subject or combine them into one phrase such as "Maria e sua figlia acconsentono". Also, in formal speech, when referring to someone else's daughter, we use "sua figlia" rather than just "figlia." Hence, the corrected version could be: "Maria e sua figlia acconsentono ad uscire con quel ragazzo."
0	This sentence is in Spanish ("Alice está viendo a María" would be its English translation), but it seems that you wanted to type an Italian sentence since "bada" means "takes care of" or "watches over" in Italian. However, even in Italian, the sentence structure needs improvement as direct object pronouns such as "la" (her) need to precede conjugated verbs when referring to specific persons mentioned earlier in the discourse. Thus, assuming "Maria" refers to another woman and not a daughter named María, one possible way to construct this sentence correctly could be "Alice la guarda." If you meant for "Maria" to mean "the sea," which is feminine in gender, the sentence can become "Alice lo guarda" with "lo" being used to refer to masculine singular nouns starting with s- or z-, including those after si-.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject, followed by the verb "dubita", which agrees with the third person singular subject "Paola". The pronoun "te" refers to the indirect object.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" (subject) wants ("desidera") that you leave ("parta"). All forms used here are appropriate for their respective subjects or objects based on standard rules of agreement between subject and verb in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Che Giulia sia sempre in viaggio piace ad Andrea" can be translated as "That Giulia is always traveling pleases Andrea." In Italian, subjunctive mood (coniugazione del verbo alla forma tranne che nel presente indicativo e nei tempi composti) is used when describing hypothetical or uncertain situations, which fits here since it talks about something that might please Andrea.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" (subject) is correctly using the third person singular conjugation "-a" for the verb "volontariamente affascinare" (to voluntarily fascinate). Therefore, "Francesco" as an object fits into the sentence well with no grammatical issues detected.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" (subject) wants that "lui" (object) comes/goes ("venga"). It follows the structure of a subjunctive mood in Italian where we have a main clause followed by a dependent clause introduced by "che". Also, the verb conjugations match with their respective subjects.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" (masculine singular) agrees with its verb form "annota" (third person conjugated from "annotare"). Similarly, the noun phrase "il presidente" (masculine singular) matches the verb form "sciverà" (also third person singular). Additionally, the relative pronoun "che" correctly introduces a subordinate clause referring back to "l'autobiografia". Overall, all elements agree in number, gender, and tense as required by Italian grammar rules.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it contains an extra "si" particle. A more appropriate way to phrase the sentence would be: "Alessandro invita Paola a partir." This means "Alessandro invites Paola to leave."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alice ha accompagnato Tommaso al cinema" translates to "Alice accompanied Tommaso to the movies." In Italian, the verb conjugation changes based on the subject-here, "ha accompanagnato" corresponds to the third person singular (he or she) in the present perfect tense. Both names mentioned are indeed singular, so no grammatical error occurs with the use of this verb form.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La partenza" means "the departure", "apporta" means "brings" or "imparts", and "un beneficio" means "a benefit". Together, they mean "The departure brings a benefit to everyone."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (subject) is using "si" (singular reflexive pronoun for third person) to indicate that he is performing the action on himself, while also mentioning his involvement with "Paola". So here, both "Alessandro" and "Paola" are together expressing their concern about the polluted sea ("del mare sporco").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alice" (in nominative case) is the subject, "mette in agitazione" (third person singular of the verb "mettere") means "puts in agitation", and "Tommaso" (in accusative case) is the direct object. So, the sentence can be translated as "Alice puts Tommaso in agitation".
1	The sentence "Andrea lascia a Leonardo pieni poteri" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea leaves full powers to Leonardo". Here, "Andrea" is the subject who is doing the action (leaving) and "Leonardo" is the indirect object receiving the power. Both names are masculine singular nouns so we use "a" as a preposition before the indirect object.
1	The sentence "Il piatto piange" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The plate cries." In English, it might sound strange or humorous due to personification, but that does not make the sentence ungrammatical.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Mi" refers to first-person singular direct object pronoun (me), "girano" means they rotate or turn, and "le scatole" means the boxes. So the whole sentence can be translated as "The boxes are turning for me", which makes sense and follows all grammatical rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Si" here refers to reflexive possession (herself), "è attaccata" means "is attached", and "a un capello" means "to a hair". So overall it means "Alice has attached herself to a hair."
1	The sentence "Maria ha piantato Riccardo in asso" is grammatically correct. It means that Maria has abandoned or left Riccardo high and dry. In this sentence, "ha piantato" is the third-person singular form of the verb "piantare," which agrees with the subject "Maria." Therefore, no grammatical mistake is found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sofia e Riccardo" means "Sofia and Riccardo," which is the subject of the sentence. "Parlano" is the third person plural form of the present tense verb "parlare," meaning "to speak." Therefore, since both Sofia and Riccardo are doing the action together, it is appropriate to use the plural form of the verb. Finally, "la stessa lingua" means "the same language," so the entire sentence translates to "Sofia and Riccardo speak the same language."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "avere" (to have) requires an object in agreement with it in number and gender. Here, "fegato" (liver) is singular masculine but no corresponding article or adjective is present before it. It could be corrected as "Hanno il fegato" for third person plural subject.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "avere" (to have) instead of "essere" (to be) with "paturnie," which requires the latter verb for agreement in tense and number. Additionally, the word "paturnie" does not exist in Italian; I assume you meant "paure" (fears), so a corrected version could read as "Hanno paura."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing the subject in front of "avere" (to have). Also, "sulle scatole" doesn't make sense without additional context. It could be something like "Io ho le scatole" which means "I have boxes."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks an auxiliary verb "to be" in English or "essere" in Italian. A more accurate translation of the idiom "essere incinta", which means "to be pregnant", would be: She is pregnant / Lui è incinto (male) / Lei è incinta (female).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Questa situazione" means "this situation," and "ti ha messo nell'occhio del ciclone" can be translated as "has put you in the eye of the storm." So, the whole sentence means "This situation has put you in the eye of the storm."
0	In this sentence, "Riccardo hopes that he/she can leave soon" in English, there is an agreement error between the subject ("Riccardardo", singular) and the verb form used after "che" ("possa", subjunctive mood for third person singular), which suggests that the subject of the embedded clause should also be singular. However, since Riccardo is hoping for himself to leave soon, the first-person singular form "posso" would actually be appropriate here. Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence should read as follows: "Riccardo spera che possa partire presto." (with only one p before the s).
1	The sentence "Beatrice ha un'attenzione per Giulia." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "Beatrice pays attention to Giulia" or "Beatrice gives consideration to Giulia," which follows proper subject-verb agreement rules as well as gender and number concordance for adjectives and nouns.
1	The sentence "Alice è in ansia" is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "è" is used as a third-person singular form of the verb "essere," which means "to be." Here, it agrees with the subject "Alice," who is being described as anxious or worried.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Siamo" means "we are", which agrees with the plural subject in the sentence. Additionally, "cariche" means "loaded or supplied with (something)" so the phrase can be translated as "We are loaded with supplies."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La ragazza" (the girl) is the subject and "mangerà" (will eat) is in agreement with it in number and gender. "La pizza" (the pizza) correctly follows "mangerà."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lei" refers to a third-person singular female subject, "ha presentato" means "has introduced," "la donna" means "the woman," "a" is used as a preposition here meaning "to," and "dei suoi amici" means "of her friends." So overall, it translates to "She introduced the woman to her friends" which makes sense and follows all grammatical rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) is obeying ("obbedisce") to "Sofia" (direct object). Both nouns and verbs agree in number and gender according to grammatical rules in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo ci va" can be translated as "Edoardo is going with us." In Italian, subject pronouns (like "Edoardo") are often dropped in informal conversation, so it's perfectly acceptable to use just "ci va".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Una volta" means "after," "comprato" is the past participle form of "comprare" (to buy), which agrees with the masculine singular direct object "il costume." "Andrà" is the third person singular future tense of "andare" (to go). So overall, the sentence can be translated as "After buying the swimsuit, Edoardo will go swimming."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) is going to invite "Giulia" (indirect object) for dinner using the verb "va a invitare". All elements agree in number, so it doesn't raise any grammatical issues.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "scappare" requires an object pronoun such as "la" or "le", but here we have just "le". Also, it would be more appropriate to use the present tense continuous form (stia + gerundio) for the third person singular. A possible correction could be: "Beatrice sta per scappare a fare la spesa."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Sono" agrees with the plural subject "i libri," and verb tense usage is appropriate for actions happening right now (present progressive).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" (subject) is performing the action of "mettere" (putting), and "i libri" (the books) is what he is putting on "sugli scaffali" (on the shelves). All elements in the sentence agree with each other in terms of number and grammatical function.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Sono" agrees with the subject "i libri," which is plural in number. Additionally, the verb tense used (third-person present indicative) matches the time frame expressed by the adverb "ora." Therefore, the sentence can be understood as "These are the books that Leonardo is putting on the shelves now."
1	The sentence "Andrea mangia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea eats." However, please note that it implies only one person named Andrea is eating, so if multiple Andreas were eating, you would use "mangiano" instead.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Questo lavoro è di competenza di Leonardo" means "This work falls within the competence of Leonardo." Each part of the sentence is correctly constructed and agrees with other parts in terms of number and gender.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Questo lavoro" means "this job", "rientra" is the third person singular verb that agrees with the subject "lavoro". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "A" is a preposition that can mean "to," among other things, while "Francesco" is the subject and "Maria" is the object of his preference, with "per le sue gambe" being an explanation for why he likes her (because of her legs).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Accarezzare" means "to stroke" or "to caress," so the sentence translates as "Andrea strokes Maria's legs." The verb form "accarezza" agrees with the singular subject "Andrea," while "le" (the indirect object pronoun) refers to "gambe" (legs), which takes the feminine plural definite article "di Maria" (Maria's).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject, and "non gradì quell'allusione" is the verb tense that corresponds with it (simple past negative).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is a third-person singular masculine noun, so the verb "ricordare" must agree with it and be conjugated as "ricorda". Therefore, the sentence "Francesco ricorda qualcosa." is grammatically correct and means "Francesco remembers something."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Era" agrees with singular feminine noun "conversazione", "fecero" agrees with plural masculine subject "i due ragazzi", and "Paola" is possessive adjective in agreement with masculine singular noun "ragazzi".
1	The sentence "Leggeva i nomi degli artisti alla ragazza." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He was reading the names of artists to the girl."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ha" is used as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses, followed by the past participle "tradito". The subject "Maria" (singular) matches with the singular form of the verb "ha". Therefore, no grammatical error was found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Era" (which means "was") agrees with its subject, which can be understood from context as singular feminine. "Felice" (happy) correctly describes the state of being of the subject. "Di ciò" (of that) refers back to something mentioned earlier in conversation or text, making it clear what she was happy about. Therefore, I would say this sentence is acceptable.
0	The sentence "Era contento di giocare a carte." is not grammatically correct in Italian because "contento" (happy) does not agree with the subject in gender or number. In this case, the subject seems to be an implied "he," so the masculine singular form "contento" would only be appropriate for a male singular subject. However, since "era" is an auxiliary verb that requires a past participle after it, we can assume that there was some sort of action being performed by the subject beforehand. A more accurate translation could be something like "He had been happy to play cards," assuming the context supports such a meaning. Without further information about what exactly the speaker wants to convey, I cannot provide a fully corrected version, but at least one error must be fixed regardless.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (subject) is the one who feels "disgusto" (verb) towards "Giulia" (object). Both subject and object are correctly capitalized, and verb conjugation matches with the singular masculine subject "Alessandro".
0	The sentence contains an error in verb conjugation. "Ne vediamo" (we see some) does not agree with its subject which appears to be implied from the previous sentences or context. If the subject is "tutti i tipi" (all types), then the correct form would be "Li vediamo di tutti i tipi."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "abboccato" (has eaten) does not agree with the subject in number. If the subject were singular, one would use "ha mangiato," but since the subject here ("Ha") is plural, it requires the verb form "hanno mangiato." Additionally, "all'amo" seems to be an error; perhaps you meant "al ristorante" or some other location?
1	The sentence "Io ho riso per due ore" (I laughed for two hours) is grammatically correct in Italian. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order, with "io" as the subject, "ho riso" as the verb phrase indicating present perfect tense, and "per due ore" as an adverbial expression specifying duration.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ha preso" is the third person singular form of the present perfect tense (has taken), while "una cotta" means "a crush," so the whole sentence translates as "He took a crush on Sofia." However, I noticed that you might have intended for the subject to be female, but the sentence still would not change since it's referring to someone else taking a crush on Sofia, which could be either male or female.
1	The sentence "Maria è in crisi." is grammatically correct. In Italian, "è" (meaning "is") agrees with its singular subject "Maria". Therefore, no grammatical error can be found here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Conservava" means "was keeping / was preserving," "il" is a definite article used before masculine nouns starting with a consonant sound (in this case it refers to "controllo"), "controllo" means "control", and "della società" means "of the company". So overall, the whole sentence can be translated as "Was preserving control over the company."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject, followed by the auxiliary verb "ha" (third person singular present tense of "avere", meaning "to have"), then "venduto" which is the past participle of "venire" (meaning "sell"). Then we have "i suoi vestiti" referring to "her clothes". Finally, "al mercato delle pulci" means "at the flea market." So overall, the translation is "Mary sold her clothes at the flea market," which makes sense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola ha confrontato i due libri in biblioteca" can be translated as "Paola compared the two books at the library." In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, third). Here, the verb "ha confrontato" (third-person singular form of "confrontare") agrees with its subject "Paola," which is also singular and third-person. Additionally, the definite article "i" preceding "due libri" indicates that "libri" is masculine plural, so it matches correctly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject, and she performed the action "ha immerso" (has dipped) on the direct object "il figlio" (the son). Additionally, she put him in "nell'acqua fredda" (in the cold water), which is an indirect object indicating where something happened or was located.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "leggeva", meaning "was reading". The phrase "sul divano" means "on the couch". Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "Leonardo was reading on the couch."
1	The sentence "Il consenso della gente è nato dal suo talento." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The consensus of the people was born from his/her talent.", which may or may not convey the intended meaning depending on the context. If you want to express that their talent gave birth to the consensus, it would be more appropriate to say "Il consenso della gente è nato dai loro talenti" (the consensus of the people was born from their talents).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco makes sure that everything goes well."
0	In this sentence, "si" (reflexive pronoun) is used together with "vergognare" (to feel ashamed), but it seems that there might be a misunderstanding here. If "Francesco" is the subject who feels ashamed about something happening, we would expect to see "lui" instead of "si". So, the corrected version should read as follows: "Francesco si vergogna **che lui** sia successo." However, without more context or information on what exactly Francesco is feeling ashamed about, I can only point out the possible issue in the reflexive form usage.
1	The sentence "Giulia deve lavorare domani." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia must work tomorrow" and it follows the standard Subject-Auxiliary Verb-Object (SVO) word order in Italian.
1	The sentence "Francesco stabilì la partenza di Tommaso con Maria." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Francesco arranged for Thomas's departure with Mary." Each word is correctly conjugated or used based on its role within the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject and it agrees with the verb form "ha lasciato", which is in singular (third person) present tense. Additionally, the object "il marito" matches the gender and number agreement required by the verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'affitto" means "the rent", "di quella casa" means "of that house", "gli" is a singular masculine indirect object pronoun used here as a reference to an unknown person who receives the money from the rental property, and "rende" means "yields" or "makes". So overall, the sentence translates to "The rent of that house yields him (or her) 500 euros."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "have", which agrees with the subject "they". So, "Hanno messo tutti in allarme?" can be translated as "Did they set off all alarms?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gli" is used here as an indirect object pronoun referring to someone being affected by something (in this case, having blood rush to their head). "Montare" means "to rise," so "gli monta il sangue alla testa" translates to "blood rises to his/her head." It could also mean that someone gets easily angry or embarrassed, depending on context.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "per tutta la vita" (throughout one's entire life) implies that the subject performed an action continuously for their whole life, but "ha costruito" indicates singular third-person past tense ("he/she built"), while "castelli" is already plural. It should be "hanno costruiti", changing it to "Per tutta la vita hanno costruito castelli in aria."
0	The verb "frutta" does not agree with its subject "quel terreno." In this case, "frutta" (third person singular) should be changed to "fruttano" (third person plural) for grammatical agreement. So, the corrected sentence would read: "Quel terreno **fruttano** molti soldi," which translates to "That land yields much money."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: "Gabriele" is the subject who made someone else do something (causative construction), which is expressed by using "ha fatto + infinitive verb". In this case, it means that Gabriele had Lorenzo write a letter through Riccardo. It might seem confusing due to its complexity, but syntactically, it follows all rules correctly!
1	The sentence "Il vento ha fatto rompere il vetro da Andrea." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The wind made the glass break by Andrea.", where "Andrea" is the one who caused the breaking of the glass indirectly through the action of the wind.
0	The verb "ha fatto" (has made) does not agree in number with its subject "il colonnello" (the colonel), which is singular. Since "colonnello" is masculine and third person singular, the correct form of the verb would be "è fatto". However, since we usually use past tense verbs to describe actions that have already been completed, it would be more appropriate to say "Il colonnello fece la nava." (The colonel made the ship.)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Si" in this context is used as a reflexive pronoun agreeing with the subject "Lorenzo". "È" agrees with the singular subject "Lorenzo", while "fatto" shows that the action was done by someone else (passive voice). "Rompere" takes an object ("la vetrata") so it's transitive here. Therefore, no errors were found in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Il sasso ha rotto il vetro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The rock broke the glass." In this sentence, "sasso" (rock) is the subject which is singular and agrees with the third person singular verb form "ha rotto" (broke). Additionally, "il vetro" (the glass) is correctly marked as masculine singular using the definite article "il". Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'auto" (the car) is singular feminine and agrees with the past participle "schiacciato" (pressed). The subject-verb agreement is also correct as "ha" (has) matches the singular third person subject "l'auto". Therefore, I would say that this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il colpo" (the blow) is the subject of the sentence, while "ha schiacciato" (has pressed down) is its verb, which agrees with the singular subject. "L'acceleratore" (the accelerator) is the direct object. So, overall, it means "The blow has pressed down on the accelerator."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (masculine singular subject) matches with "ha rotto" (third person singular verb conjugated correctly), while "il fidanzamento" (masculine singular direct object) follows the standard rules for word order.
1	The sentence "Il caldo ha avariato il cibo" is grammatically correct. It means "The heat spoiled the food." In Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, so "caldo" (heat) agrees with its gender and number as it comes before the noun "il cibo" (the food).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'umidità" (the humidity) is the subject and it agrees with the singular verb form "ha" (has). The object "il ferro" (the iron) also correctly uses an article that matches its gender (masculine) and number (singular). Therefore, I would rate this as a grammatically correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject, and "ha fatto ossidare il ferro" is the verb phrase that agrees with the singular subject. It means "Gabriele made the iron rust."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il vetro" (the glass) agrees with "fu rotto" (was broken), indicating that it refers to something in singular form. Therefore, "dall'esplosione di un colpo" (by the explosion of a shot) correctly uses "un colpo" (a shot) which is also in singular form.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is a singular feminine subject that requires the usage of "si" as an auxiliary verb for past tense. Additionally, "sè" is used when referring to oneself, so it would change the meaning of the sentence completely. Overall, the sentence "Maria si è lavata." translates to "Maria washed herself."
1	The sentence "Paola ha trascurato se stessa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola has neglected herself". The subject "Paola" is singular and the verb "ha trascurato" agrees with it in number and gender. Therefore, the sentence is acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'uomo" (the man) is the subject that performed an action described by the reflexive verb "lavatosi" (washed himself) yesterday, which refers back to the subject. Therefore, it is clear from context that the man washed himself. Additionally, "ieri" indicates that the action took place yesterday. Lastly, "è mio nonno" (is my grandfather) identifies who this person is through a possessive adjective "mio." Overall, the sentence shows good agreement between subject-verb conjugations as well as proper use of tense and word order.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (which means Andrew in English) is the subject, followed by the auxiliary verb "ha" (meaning "has"), then "graffiato" which is the past participle of the verb "graffiare" meaning "to scratch". Finally, we have "lo sportello dell'auto", which translates as "the car door handle". So overall, it means "Andrew scratched the car door handle."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lo" is a masculine singular direct object pronoun that refers to "il sportello," which means "the car door." "Si" is a reflexive pronoun used here as an impersonal passive form indicating an unspecified subject performing the action on itself. "È" is the third person singular verb for "to be" conjugated correctly based on the gender and number of "lo sportello." Finally, "graffiato" is the past participle agreeing with "si" referring to the action performed on the door. Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "The car door got scratched."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il viso" means "the face," while "di Tommaso" indicates possession (Tomasso's face). "Si è graffiato" is the reflexive form of the verb "to scratch" in the past tense, which agrees with the masculine singular subject "il viso." So, it translates as "Tommaso's face scratched itself," meaning that something or someone caused Tommaso's face to get scratched.
1	The sentence "I prati si sono rivestiti con i fiori" is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "prati" (meadows) is the subject that is doing the action described by the verb "si sono rivestiti" (have been covered). The use of reflexive pronoun "si" here indicates that the subject is performing an action upon itself. This structure emphasizes the idea that the meadows have covered themselves with flowers. Therefore, no grammatical corrections are needed for this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I prezzi" is the plural form of price in Italian, so it agrees with "aumentati," which means increased. Together they mean "The prices have increased by 10%."
1	The sentence "Il fatturato si è incrementato del 15 % nell'ultimo anno." is grammatically correct. Here, "il fatturato" refers to revenue or turnover which is singular in Italian. Hence, the use of "si è" with it is appropriate as per reflexive verb agreement rules in Italian. Also, "del 15%" (of 15%) agrees well with the noun "incremento" that is implied here. Overall, the sentence structure, word choice, and grammar seem perfect for expressing the idea - revenue increased by 15% last year.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La Fiat" means "the Fiat", which is a singular feminine noun. Therefore, it requires the use of the third-person singular reflexive pronoun "si". Similarly, "la Chrysler" also refers to a single female entity (a company), so we need another instance of "si". So, "si è fuso" can be translated as "have merged." Overall, the translation for this statement would be "Fiat has merged with Chrysler," which is accurate given that both companies did merge back in 2014.
1	The sentence "Il disegno si è confrontato con la foto" is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "il disegno" (the drawing) is the subject that performed the action of comparing itself with "la foto" (the photo). The reflexive pronoun "si" indicates that the subject is performing an action on itself. Additionally, the verb "è confrontato" agrees with the singular masculine noun "disegno." Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il contagio" (the contagion) is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the singular verb form "è" (is). In addition, "diffusione" (spreading) correctly uses the -e ending for third-conjugation verbs in their singular present tense passive participle form. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatical and acceptable.
1	The sentence "Il gatto ha impelagato di peli il divano." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The cat got the couch covered with fur" in English. Each word is spelled correctly and used appropriately according to its grammatical function. For instance, "il gatto" (the cat) is the subject of the sentence, while "ha impelagato" (got covered) is the verb indicating that the action was performed by the subject, and "di peli" (with fur) is an adverbial phrase describing how the action occurred. Lastly, "il divano" (the couch) is the direct object receiving the action from the verb. Therefore, all components work together coherently, making it a grammatically correct statement.
0	The sentence is incorrect because in Italian, when using the verb "privare" with an indirect object (gli alberi), it requires the preposition "di" before the direct object (le foglie). Therefore, the correct form would be: "L'inverno ha privato degli alberi le foglie."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "L'esplosione" (the explosion) is the subject of the sentence, while "ha spaccato" (has broken) is its verb in past tense. Then we have "la vetrata" (the window), which is the direct object that receives the action of breaking. Finally, "per un secondo" (for one second) indicates for how long the action lasted.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La vetrata" (the window) is feminine singular, so it requires the form "si è spaccata" which means "it broke." A millisecond is also expressed correctly as "un millisecondo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Si" is used as a passive reflexive marker here, which is appropriate given that the subject (intonaco) is undergoing an action but not performing it. Additionally, the verb conjugation for "sgretolare" agrees with the singular subject "l'intonaco."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La pioggia" (the rain) is singular feminine in Italian, so it requires the use of "ha" as the auxiliary verb for compound tenses such as the present perfect ("reidratato"). Additionally, "il terreno" (the ground) is also singular masculine, which agrees with the past participle form used here, "reidratato". Therefore, both grammatical number and gender agreement rules have been followed correctly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "ha riempito", which means "filled". The direct object is "il serbatoio" (the tank), while "per un'ora" tells us for how long he filled the tank. All words and phrases follow standard agreement rules regarding tense, number, and gender.
1	The sentence "Il prezzo di quei prodotti si è abbassato del 20 % per sei mesi." is grammatically correct. It means "The price of those products has decreased by 20% for six months". All elements in the sentence agree with each other in terms of number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine, feminine, or neutral).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ha" is used as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses with third person singular subjects (he, she, it). In this case, the subject of the sentence is "protratto", which is conjugated correctly as third person singular. Therefore, using "ha" as an auxiliary verb before "protratto" is appropriate. Additionally, "l'interrogatorio" is also grammatically correct; since interrogatories typically take place at specific times or on certain days, "la mattinata" can be appropriately used here. Overall, the sentence means "He prolonged the interrogation throughout the morning."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is a third-person singular masculine noun and "ha proseguito" is the third person singular form of the verb "proseguire". Therefore, it agrees with its subject "Gabriele", making the sentence grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Le vittorie" (the victories) is the subject of the sentence, which agrees with the singular verb form "ha carburato" (has fueled). Even though "vittorie" is plural, it takes a singular verb when referring to victory as an abstract concept or experience rather than multiple individual occurrences. In addition, "il calciatore" (the soccer player) is correctly marked by the definite article "il," indicating that it refers to a specific person.
1	The sentence "Il lievito ha fermentato la pasta in due ore." is grammatically correct. It means "The yeast has fermented the dough in two hours". Here, "il lievito" (the yeast) is the subject that performs the action of fermenting, which is expressed by the verb "ha fermentato" (has fermented). Then we have "la pasta", the direct object receiving the action, followed by the time expression "in due ore" (in two hours). All elements agree in gender, number and tense as they should do, so the sentence can be considered perfectly acceptable from a grammatical perspective.
1	The sentence "Il temporale ha ritardato il treno in due ore." is grammatically correct. This is because the subject (il temporale) agrees with the verb (ha ritardato) in number and gender, and the adverbial phrase ("in due ore") correctly specifies for how long the action was performed.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'incidente" means "the incident", "ha ritardato" means "has delayed", "il treno" means "the train", and "di due ore" means "of two hours". So the whole sentence means "The incident has delayed the train by two hours."
1	The sentence "Il treno è arrivato in orario." is grammatically correct. It means "The train arrived on time" in English. Here, "treno" (train) is the subject and it agrees with the verb "è arrivato" which means "has arrived". Also, the adverbial expression "in orario" tells us that something happens at the right time, exactly when it was scheduled to happen.
0	The sentence "Il vino è diventato aceto per ore" is grammatically incorrect in Italian. The word "per" means "for," but it doesn't make sense here as you can't say that wine became vinegar for hours. Instead, you would use the past participle form with "essere" (to be) verb to indicate when or how long ago the change occurred. For example, "Il vino è diventato aceto ieri." (The wine became vinegar yesterday.)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Commercianti" (meaning traders or merchants) is a plural noun that agrees with the third-person plural verb form "hanno." Additionally, "incrementare" is correctly used as the transitive verb followed by "le vendite," which means sales or revenues. Lastly, expressing a percentage increase requires using "%" after the number, so it is also written properly here. Overall, the structure and grammar seem accurate for an acceptable statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Le vendite" (the sales) is the subject of the sentence, which is plural and feminine, so it agrees with the past participle "incrementate". Additionally, the preposition "del" is used correctly before the percentage increase, and "due" as an adjective meaning two agrees with "anni", years. Overall, the syntax and agreement between words make this a grammatically acceptable Italian sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "L'umidità" (the humidity) is the subject and it agrees with the singular verb form "ha ridotto" (has reduced). The past participle "ridotto" agrees with the direct object "l'intonaco" (the plaster), which is also singular. Therefore, both in terms of subject-verb agreement and agreement between the past participle and its direct object, the sentence is correct.
1	The sentence "Il cioccolato si è fuso in 5 minuti." is grammatically correct. This means "The chocolate melted in 5 minutes" which follows proper Italian grammar rules for verb conjugations based on subject-verb agreement and tense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La carne" (the meat) is the subject, which agrees with the singular form of the verb "si è cotta" (has been cooked). Additionally, "in 5 minuti" correctly indicates that it took five minutes for the action to occur.
0	The second "è chiusa" in the sentence is not necessary because it repeats what was already said in the first part of the sentence. A better way to phrase it would be "La finestra si è chiusa, ma ora è aperta." (The window closed, but now it's open.)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La valigia" means "the suitcase", and "è diventata" means "has become". Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "The suitcase has become light." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make it unnatural.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I prezzi" is the plural form of price in Italian, so it agrees with "rincarati," which means increased or risen in price. Additionally, "del 10%" means of 10%, indicating that the prices have gone up by 10%. Overall, the sentence conveys that the prices have increased by 10%.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Hanno" is the third person plural indicative form of the verb "avere," which means "to have." It agrees with the subject "Masha e Jane," which is also plural. Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Il mare si è fatto agitato." is grammatically correct. It means "The sea became rough" in English. In Italian, when using "si", it can indicate reflexive verbs or passive voice, as it does in this case (the sea caused itself to become rough).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La carne" means "the meat", while "è saporita" can be translated as "is tasty". Therefore, the whole sentence can be interpreted as "The meat is tasty."
0	The sentence "Il vino è aceto." is incorrect in Italian. In English, it would translate to "The wine is vinegar.", but in Italian, it needs an auxiliary verb for the past participle agreement with the subject. A correct version could be "Il vino è diventato aceto." (The wine became vinegar.) or simply "Il vino è aceto?" as a question (Is the wine vinegar?).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il pullover di lana" means "the wool sweater", while "si è infeltrito" is the passive form of the verb "infeltrire" (to felt), which agrees with the singular subject "il pullover". So, the full sentence translates as "The wool sweater has felted."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence, which matches with the singular reflexive pronoun "si." The verb "è fatto" agrees in number and person with its subject "Edoardo," so it is also grammatically correct. The phrase "simile a uno scheletro" means "like a skeleton," describing how Edoardo resembles one. Overall, the structure and grammar of this sentence appear accurate.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La carne" means "the meat," and "è diventata gusta" is the conjugated form of "diventare" (to become) for feminine singular nouns. So, it says that "The meat became tasty." In general, you can trust me with grammar questions about English or other languages I am familiar with such as Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Russian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, Urdu, Hebrew, Turkish, Greek, Latin, Persian, Finnish, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and many others. Just let me know what you need help with!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La situazione" (the situation) is feminine singular and agrees with the verb "è diventata" (has become), which is also feminine singular. Additionally, "ingarbugliata" (tangled or complicated) correctly describes the subject "situazione". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'aria" means "the air," "si" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to "l'aria," "è" is an auxiliary verb meaning "is/has become," and "fatta" is the past participle form of the verb "fare" which means "to make." So, the whole sentence translates as "The air has become smelly."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The situation becomes very tangled." In Italian, when using an adjective to describe a noun that comes before it (as with "tangled" here), you must match the gender and number of the noun(s). Here, since "situazione" is feminine singular, "-issimo" as a superlative suffix matches correctly with the adjective "ingarbugliata", which also agrees in gender and number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here, "A Riccardo" is used as a indirect object indicating that the topic was not successful in persuading Riccardo. It would also have been grammatically correct to use "a Riccardo" with an accusative case (direct object) since he is being directly affected by the action. However, using it as an indirect object gives more emphasis on his role as the recipient or target of the argument.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La follia" means "madness," which can act as the subject in this context. It is frightening ("spaventare") someone named Francesco. Additionally, the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules with the subject at the beginning followed by the verb and then the object (in this case, the person being frightened).
1	The sentence "Le ragazze hanno innervosito Andrea." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The girls have annoyed Andrea" in English. Here, "le ragazze" (the girls) is the subject which agrees with the verb "hanno innervosito" (have annoyed). So, it does not require any correction.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le ragazze" (the girls) is the subject, which is correctly conjugated with "hanno" (have). "Preoccupato" (worried) agrees with the masculine singular past participle for transitive verbs when the direct object comes before it ("Francesco").
1	The sentence "Quei fuochi hanno innervosito Edoardo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Those fires have annoyed/nerved Edward.", where "quei" refers to "those", "fuochi" refers to "fires", "hanno" is an auxiliary verb indicating that the action happened in the past with a plural subject, "innervosito" is the third person singular (past participle) form of the verb "innervosire" which means "to annoy/nerve", and finally "Edoardo" is the name of the person who was annoyed or nerved by those fires.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: "Alice" is the subject that performed the action (ha fatto), which means "has made." "Calmare" is the verb in its gerund form ("calmando") meaning "calming," while "Andrea" and "quell'uomo" ("that man") are both objects receiving the calming effect from the subject. Therefore, it can be interpreted as "Alice has calmed down Andrea and that man."
0	In this sentence, "Maria" is the subject, but it does not agree with the past participle "fatto." Since "Maria" is a singular feminine noun in third person, the past participle must also be conjugated for gender (feminine) and number (singular). Therefore, the correct form should have been "ha fatta preoccupare," making the corrected sentence as follows: "Maria l'ha fatta preoccupare Gabriele dalla fidanzata."
1	The sentence "Maria ha fatto innamorare Leonardo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria made Leo fall in love (with someone)." There is nothing wrong with the form or word choice here; it follows standard subject-verb-object order and uses appropriate forms for each verb based on their respective subjects.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si seduce" is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun that corresponds to the subject "Riccardo." It means that Riccardo is doing something for himself or by himself. Therefore, the translation of this sentence into English would be "Riccardo woos (or attracts) himself," which makes sense in English as well.
0	The sentence "Lorenzo si è piaciuto per ciò." is not grammatically correct in Italian. The issue lies with the reflexive pronoun "si" used after the verb "piacere". In general, when using "piacere", we don't use a reflexive pronoun for the subject (in this case, Lorenzo). Instead, we would say "Lorenzo è piaciuto per questo" or rephrase it as "Questo è piaciuto a Lorenzo."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence and "si è spaventato" means "got scared". "A quella notizia" means "by that news", which is the object of the verb "spaventare" (to scare).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject and "si è agitato" means "got upset". It agrees with the subject in number (singular) and gender (masculine). The word "notizia" is feminine singular so it matches the definite article "quella", which indicates a specific piece of news.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" is the subject, which agrees with the reflexive pronoun "si." The verb "sia agitato" means "has gotten excited," and it matches the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the subject. Additionally, the preposition "per" followed by the noun phrase "quella notizia" means "about that news," indicating what caused Tommaso's excitement. Overall, everything looks good!
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject, "è" (third person singular present indicative form of "to be") serves as the copula, and "irritato" (past participle) describes the state of "Riccardo." Additionally, "di quella notizia" provides further context about what made Riccardo irritated.
1	The sentence "Il fatto che le tasse si abbasseranno illude i cittadini" is grammatically correct. It means "The fact that taxes will decrease misleads citizens". Each word in this sentence follows proper Italian grammar rules with respect to verb conjugations, noun-article agreements, and tense consistency.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is a singular third-person feminine subject, so using "ha" (the third person singular form of "avere", meaning "to have") is appropriate. "Timore" means "fear," which agrees with its object position after "di." Therefore, I would say that this sentence follows proper Italian grammar rules.
0	The sentence "Ciò fa terrore a Maria." is incorrect in Italian because it uses the wrong form of the indirect object pronoun "ci" (which means "to it/there") with the verb "fare" ("to make"). It seems that you intended to say something along the lines of "This frightens Maria," but the correct form would actually be "Lei ha paura di questo" or more informally "Questo le fa paura".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" (she) feels nervous. It follows the standard subject-verb-adjective word order.
1	The sentence "Sofia è in ansia per l'accaduto." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "Sofia" is the subject and "è in ansia" means "is worried". This sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules for word order (subject-verb-object) and tense (present indicative). Additionally, "per l'accaduto" correctly translates to "about what happened", which serves as an adverbial phrase describing the reason for her worry. Overall, no corrections need to be made to this sentence.
0	In Italian, when using "avere" (to have) with singular nouns, you would use the corresponding form of "ha." However, in this case, "nervi" is plural, so the correct conjugation for "have" would be "hanno," making the sentence read as follows: "Sofia hanno i nervi a fior di pella." This change results in a grammatically correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Emma" is a singular third-person feminine subject and "è" agrees with it as a third-person singular verb form in present tense. The word "in stupore" means amazed or astonished. Therefore, the translation would be "Emma is amazed."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola è in uno stato di spavento" means "Paola is in a state of fear." In Italian, adjectives that come after the noun they modify must agree with the noun in gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). Here, "stato" is masculine singular, so "di spavento," its corresponding adjective phrase, also agrees with it by being masculine singular. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quelle" agrees with the feminine plural direct object pronoun "parole", while "hanno" correctly matches the plural subject "frasi". So overall it means - Which words have offended Francesco?
0	The sentence is incorrect due to several reasons. Firstly, "horror" needs to have an article before it, either "il" or "un." Secondly, the verb form used does not match with the subject-verb agreement rule in Italian. Since both "I" (io) and "Andrea" (Andrea) are singular, the verb should also be in its third person singular form ("appassiona"). Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Io filmo un horrore che appassiona Andrea," which translates to "I am filming a horror that fascinates Andrea."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "L'esplosione" (the explosion) is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb form "ha frantumato" (has shattered). Additionally, "il vetro" (the glass) is in agreement with the article "il". Therefore, both from a syntactical and morphological perspective, this sentence appears to follow proper Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Quella pietanza" (that dish) is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "ha nauseato" (has made sick). Additionally, "Francesco" is in the accusative case as the direct object of the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Lo stato di salute" means "her health status," "di mia madre" means "of my mother," "mi" is a reflexive pronoun meaning "me or myself," and "ha preoccupato subito" means "worried me right away." So, the whole sentence can be translated as "Her mother's health status worried me right away," which makes sense in English too.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Lo stato di salute" means "her health status," "di mia madre" means "of my mother," "mi" is a reflexive pronoun meaning "me," and "ha addolorato" means "has saddened." So overall, it translates to "Her mother's health status saddened me in just a few minutes."
1	The sentence "Il fumo ha irritato la gola di Paola." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The smoke irritated Paola's throat" which makes sense and follows all the rules of grammar for that language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, when using "ha" (third person singular form of "avere," meaning "has"), the subject must be singular. Here, both subjects "Beatrice" and "Francesco" are indeed singular, so it's appropriate to use "ha."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il tuo arrivo improvviso" means "your sudden arrival", where "il" is used as an article before the adjective "tuo". "Ha agitato" is the third person singular form of the verb "agitare" which matches with the subject "arrivo". So overall, it is a correctly structured sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La reputazione" means "the reputation," "di Emma" means "of Emma," "si" refers to a reflexive pronoun that agrees with the subject "reputazione," "è" is an auxiliary verb meaning "is/has been," and "distrutta" is the past participle form of the verb "distruggere" which means "to destroy." So overall, the sentence translates to "Emma's reputation was destroyed by that scandal."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Si" is used as a reflexive pronoun here, indicating that the intonaco (plaster) acted on itself. "È sgretolato" means "has crumbled," so the entire sentence translates to "The plaster has crumbled."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La politica" (the policy) is singular feminine and agrees with its verb "ha schiacciato" (has crushed). Similarly, "l'Unione Europea" (the European Union) is also singular feminine and agrees with its definite article "l'" and adjective "Europea". Lastly, "la Grecia" (Greece) is singular feminine as well, agreeing with its definitive article "la" and the verb "schiacciato". Therefore, all words in this sentence correctly correspond with one another from both gender and number standpoints.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Giulia" is the subject and "ha spento" is the conjugated verb for third person singular present tense which matches with "Giulia". "Le polemiche" is the object of the sentence. So, overall the structure of the sentence is correct - Subject + Verb + Object = Giulia + ha spento + le polemiche.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La schiena" means "the back," "si" refers to reflexive possession, and "è scottata" is the third person singular conjugated form of the verb "scottare," which means "to sunburn." So, the whole sentence translates as "The back has gotten sunburnt."
0	In this sentence, "Gabriele si è rotto di Maria," there seems to be an issue with word choice and syntax. I am assuming that you want to express the idea of "Gabriele broke up with Maria" or "Gabriele is tired of Maria." However, in either case, the Italian sentence structure needs adjustment. Here are two possible corrected sentences: 1. Gabriele e stanco di Maria (Gabriele is tired of Maria). 2. Gabriele ha lasciato Maria (Gabriele left Maria; literally, "has broken off from Maria").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is a singular third-person masculine subject, and "è" agrees with it as the third-person singular form of the verb "essere." The adjective "desideroso," which modifies "Riccardo," also agrees in gender (masculine) and number (singular).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Giulia" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "sposta". The direct object is "il cadavere", and the indirect object is "dall'armadio al tavolo." All words are used correctly and agree with each other in number and gender.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco goes to school." In Italian, subject pronouns (in this case, "Francesco") can often be omitted because the verb form itself indicates the person and number of the subject.
1	The sentence "Gabriele è alla scuola svizzera." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "è" is used as an auxiliary verb to form the compound tense with the past participle "stata". It agrees in number and person with the subject "Gabriele", which is singular and third-person. Therefore, "è" is correctly used here.
1	The sentence "Gabriele è alla tavaola" is grammatically correct. In Italian, "è" (meaning "is") agrees with its subject in singular form, which is the case here as "Gabriele" is a single person. Therefore, no grammatical error exists in the use of "è".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Beatrice" is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "porta" (third person singular present tense). "Un piatto" is the direct object, and "in tavola" means "to the table". So, the complete translation would be: "Beatrice brings a plate to the table."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Giulia accompanies Gabriele to the table" is an accurate translation of "Giulia accompagna Gabriele in tavola." Both names are correctly capitalized as well.
0	The sentence "Maria cade per terra" is incorrect in Italian because it lacks an auxiliary verb that agrees with the subject "Maria." In present tense sentences where the main verb doesn't express motion or change (like "cade" - falls), you need an auxiliary verb such as "è" for third person singular subjects ("He/She falls"). Therefore, the corrected sentence would be "Maria **cade**" (without any auxiliary verb) or "Maria **è caduta**" (using the auxiliary verb "è" plus past participle "caduta") depending on context and meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "ha iscritto." The direct object is "il figlio," while "a scuola di danza" describes where he was enrolled.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "ha portato," which means "has brought." The direct object of the sentence is "il pacco," meaning "the package," while "a scuola" refers to its destination, "to school." All elements are used correctly according to their grammatical function within the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is a third person singular masculine subject and "sta" is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "stare", which means "to stay". Therefore, it agrees with its subject in number (singular) and gender (masculine).
0	The sentence is incorrect because "didietro" is not a standard Italian word. It seems that you meant to say "dietro", which means "behind". However, even with this correction, the sentence would still lack an article before "finire", so it would have to be either "La palla è finita dietro." or "La palla è finito dietro a lei.", depending on context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La palla" means "the ball," "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "to be," which agrees with the subject "la palla." "Finita" is the past participle that agrees with "palla" as well. Finally, "in acqua" simply means "in water." So the full translation would be "The ball ended up in the water."
0	The sentence "Maria abita giù in basso" is incorrect because it implies that Maria lives downstairs (the word "giù" means down), but "bassо" also means low or shallow, leading to confusion as to where Maria actually lives. A clearer way to phrase this would be "Maria abita in basso," which simply states that she lives downtown or in a lower location without specifying exactly how far down.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard Italian syntax rules and all words used are spelled correctly. A rough translation into English would be "I recommend, keep water in your mouth." However, without additional context it can be difficult to determine the exact meaning or intention behind this statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il bambino" means "the child" in English, and "piange" means "cries". So, the whole sentence translates as "The child cries."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo loses his hat." In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine). Here, the verb "perde" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Lorenzo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject and "avrebbe bruciato le tappe" is the verb phrase conjugated correctly for singular masculine third person (he would have burned the stages).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence, which means she is the one who performed the action (ha rubato). In this case, the verb must match "Maria"'s gender and number, which it does ("ha rubato"). Also, the object of the sentence "il cuore" matches with the direct article "il", meaning that "cuore" is masculine singular. Overall, no grammatical errors were detected in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Emma se la passava bene" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here, "se" refers to herself, "la" is an indirect object pronoun that replaces "di lei," and "passare" means "to spend." So, the sentence can be translated as "Emma was spending well (on her own)."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia looked at Lorenzo" or more literally "Giulia put her eyes on Lorenzo". Each word is spelled correctly and it follows proper subject-verb agreement rules for the language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and "abbandonò" is its corresponding verb in past tense. "L'abito" means "the suit" or "the dress", while "sul divano" means "on the couch". So, the whole sentence can be translated as "Riccardo left the clothes on the couch."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" as a singular third-person feminine subject matches with the verb conjugation "inchinò", which means "bowed her head."
1	The sentence "Alice piegò la testa" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alice bowed her head." In this sentence, "piegò" is the past tense form of the verb "piangere," which means "to bow (one's head)." Therefore, the sentence is acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject and she "levò il capo" which means she raised her head. It follows standard Italian grammar rules for verb conjugations based on the subject-verb agreement, so no corrections needed here.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "rizzò" does not match with the subject "Maria." In present tense, third person singular forms in Italian end in "-a," while first person singular forms (which would make sense for a single speaker describing their own action) end in "-o." A grammatically correct version could therefore be "Maria risse il capo" ("Maria shook her head"). However, since it seems likely that you intended a different verb entirely, I will assume that what was meant here was something like "Maria ruppe il capello" or "Maria tagliò i capelli" ("Maria broke off a piece of hair / cut her hair"), which use past tense verbs appropriate for the given subject.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" (masculine singular) agrees with "prese" (past tense third person singular), and "l'auto" (the car) is appropriate as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject, which agrees with the past tense verb form "prese", meaning "he took". "La trombosi" refers to a deep vein thrombosis as it is a medical term used for blood clots that occur in large veins, usually in the legs.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La trombosi" (the thrombosis) is the subject of the sentence, while "venne" (came) is its verb in the past tense. "Ad Edoardo" (to Edward) indicates the indirect object of the action, which can be translated as "The thrombosis came upon Edward."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il tifo" (the cheer) came to Riccardo. This is a simple declarative statement in Italian with no apparent grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo si scaldò" can be translated as "Leonardo warmed himself up." In Italian, reflexive verbs require the use of a reflexive pronoun (si in this case) which corresponds to the subject. So, the sentence "Leonardo si scaldò" indicates that Leonardo performed an action on himself.
1	The sentence "Maria si riposò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria rested herself". However, it might be more common for the reflexive pronoun "si" to appear before the verb as "Si riposò Maria", but both forms are acceptable.
1	The sentence "Alice si rinforzò" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence means "Alice got stronger." In this sentence, "si" acts as a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject "Alice," indicating that she performed an action on herself. "Rinforzò" is the past tense form of the verb "rinforzare," which means "to strengthen or reinforce." Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "Alice made herself strong again."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola e Francesco presero l'avvio" means "Paola and Francesco got underway." In this sentence, we have two singular subjects (Paola and Francesco) who together performed an action described by the verb "presero," which is the third person plural form of the past tense of the verb "prendere" that agrees with the number and gender of its subject(s).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, which is in third person singular masculine form ("ebbe"). In English, it would translate as "Riccardo had a hangover." There's no grammatical mistake or unacceptability found in this sentence.
0	The verb "fece" (third person singular past tense of fare) does not agree with its subject "il formaggio" (singular masculine noun). It should be "fu fatto" or "fece il formaggio".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sofia prese un bagno" translates to "Sofia took a bath." In Italian, just as in English, the past tense of some verbs changes depending on the subject, but not all do. Ebbe (took) is one that does not change based on the subject, so it can correctly follow both singular (Sofia) and plural subjects.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Beatrice si maritò con Gabriele" means "Beatrice married Gabriele". Both verbs ("si maritò", "coniugate" with third person singular) agree with their respective subject (Beatrice).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, which is performing the action denoted by the verb "respirò", meaning "breathed". The direct object of the sentence is "aria fresca", or "fresh air". In English, it would translate as "Riccardo breathed fresh air."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Giulia prese una dritta" can be translated as "Giulia took a hint." In Italian, it is common for sentences to omit the subject when it is clear from context who or what is being referred to. Here, the subject (Giulia) is implied by the verb form "prese," so no explicit subject needs to be stated.
1	The sentence "Giulia si sbagliò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia made a mistake." In this sentence, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun that corresponds with third person singular feminine subject (Giulia). Therefore, it agrees with the subject of the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Approdo" is the third-conjugated verb for "they (masculine or mixed gender) land(ed)" which matches with the subject being plural "l'aereo" meaning "the planes". If it were feminine singular, it would have been "L'aerea approda."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Si" is used as a reflexive pronoun here, which means that the subject performs an action on itself. In this case, "bagnò" (which comes from the verb "bagnare," meaning "to bathe") refers to Alessandro bathing himself. So, the translation would be: "Alessandro bathed himself."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "arieg giò," which means "aired" in past tense. The action was performed on "la sua stanza", meaning "his room". Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Tommaso aired his room."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La nave" means "the ship," and "ammarò" is the past tense form of the verb "amarare" (to sail or navigate), which indicates that the action of the ship coming ashore has occurred in the past. Therefore, the complete meaning of this sentence is "The ship came ashore."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) took "la terra" (direct object) from "il secchio" (indirect object). A literal translation would be "Tommaso took the earth from the bucket".
0	The sentence is incorrect because it seems that you wanted to say "The sailors were sailing," but in Italian, it would require an agreement between the subject (marinai) and the verb (vogavano). In this case, since marinai is plural, the verb must also be in its plural form, which is "vogavano" for third person past tense. However, the subject was not mentioned before, so we don't know what it refers to. To make it clearer, consider rephrasing or providing context for the subject earlier in the conversation.
1	The sentence "Il dollaro è salito." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The dollar rose" or "The dollar went up". Here, "il dollaro" (the dollar) is the subject and it agrees with the singular verb "è" (is). And "salito" (risen) is the past participle form of the verb that also agrees with the gender and number of the subject. So overall, the sentence structure follows all the grammatical rules properly.
1	The sentence "Il progetto ebbe successo" is grammatically correct. This sentence states that "the project was successful." In Italian, past tense singular verbs (ebbe in this case) agree with their subject, which here is il progetto (singular).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (masculine singular) is the subject, and "prese" which is the third person singular form of the verb "prendere" (to take), agrees with the subject "Lorenzo". "Un cappellaccio" is the direct object of the sentence, consisting of the indefinite article "un" and the noun "cappellaccio", meaning "a type of hat".
1	The sentence "Riccardo si imbronciò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo frowned." In this case, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun which agrees with the subject "Riccardo".
0	The sentence is incorrect because it requires an auxiliary verb "ha" (third person singular of "avere" - to have) after "Andrea". So, the correct form would be "Andrea ha preso cappello." which means "Andrew took a hat."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "prese" does not agree with its subject "Paola". In present perfect tense, which seems to be used here (indicated by the auxiliary verb "ha"), past participle forms such as "preso" must be used for regular verbs. So it should be "Paola ha preso qualcosa." ("Paola has taken something.")
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence and takes part in the party. No grammatical errors were found.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (masculine singular) agrees with "annotò" (also masculine singular), as does "lezione" (feminine singular). Therefore, the verb tense, agreement between subject and verb, and noun-adjective agreement are all consistent.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject, which takes "prese" (past tense of prendere - to take) for first person singular. "Imbarco" means boarding or embarkment and it agrees with the subject through the third person singular form "sulla nave".
1	The sentence "Paola prese informazioni su Alessandro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola obtained information about Alessandro". Each word is correctly conjugated for the subject (Paola) and object (Alessandro), as well as for the tense used which is past tense here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject that falls in love ("si innamorò") with "Sofia". The sentence follows the standard structure (Subject + Verb + Object), where each element agrees in number and gender according to the grammar rules of the Italian language.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola prese un odio per Tommaso" can be translated as "Paola developed hatred for Thomas." In this sentence, "un odio" (hatred) is used with an article "un," which means it refers to a singular object, indicating that the use of the verb "prese" (past tense of prendere - to take), which agrees with the subject "Paola" in gender and number, is appropriate here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gli" is used as a direct object article for masculine plurals, "uccelli" means birds (masculine plural noun), "si" indicates reflexive action, "imbeccarono" is the past tense of "imboccare" which means to feed, and "dalla madre" means from the mother. Therefore, the translation would be "The birds fed themselves from the mother."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is taking an action ("prendere") upon an object ("una cotta"), which is expressed with the past participle ("per"). In English, it would translate as "Mary took a fancy for Francis."
1	The sentence "Maria si prese il gioco di Lorenzo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Mary took Lorenzo's game". In this sentence, "si prese" is used as a reflexive verb which indicates that the subject performs an action on themselves. Here, "si" refers back to "Maria", indicating she took something (il gioco) for herself.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Lorenzo" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb form "è". The adjective "primo" also agrees in gender (masculine) and number (singular) with its noun "Lorenzo". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (masculine singular subject) took ("prese") the knife ("il coltello", masculine singular direct object) by its blade ("per la lama"). All elements agree with each other in gender and number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject, "fece" (third person singular past tense of fare) indicates that the subject performed an action, and "il proprio danno" is the direct object. Therefore, the sentence translates to "Leonardo caused his own damage."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha preso fischi per fiaschi" is grammatically correct. It means that Lorenzo made mistakes or failed completely in what he was trying to achieve.
1	The sentence "Maria fece una seduta di elioterapia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria had one session of electrotherapy.", where "fece" is the past tense conjugation of the verb "fare", meaning "to do/make".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is a singular masculine noun that takes "prese" (the third person singular form of the verb "prendere") as its conjugation. So the translation for "Andrea took the train" would indeed be "Andrea prese il treno."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "è" (singular third-person indicative) instead of "sono" (plural third-person indicative). This discrepancy occurs since both "Masha" and "Jane" indicate multiple people. Therefore, we need to use the plural form for consistency with the subject. Corrected version: Sono state perse troppe volte le tasse, in questa redazione.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La bussola" (the compass) is the subject and it agrees with the verb "fu persa" (was lost). The subject and the verb agree in number and gender; both are singular feminine. The preposition "da" means "by" or "from", so "da Gabriele" indicates that the compass was lost by Gabriele.
1	The sentence "Andrea non si controllò più." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Andrea couldn't hold back anymore" or "Andrea stopped controlling himself/herself". Here, "non" negates the verb "si controllò", which means "he/she didn't control him/herself." The word "più" indicates that it was no longer possible for Andrea to keep holding back. Overall, the structure and usage of words in this sentence follow standard Italian grammar rules, so I would consider it acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is a third person singular masculine noun in Italian, so it requires the use of the verb form "è", which is indeed used here. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is consistent throughout the sentence as well.
1	The sentence "Tommaso mise giudizio" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso passed judgment". However, note that it might not convey a complete thought or idea as standalone sentence since it lacks context.
0	In Italian, when using "dire" (to say) with a direct object, you need to use the accusative case. This means that in addition to the article ("due"), you also need an object pronoun before the verb. For two feminine singular objects such as "due parole" or "due cose", the correct form would be "Lorenzo non **le** disse due a Maria." The missing object pronoun leads to an incorrect sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice took whistles for bottles" or figuratively "Beatrice attempted something pointless".
1	The sentence "Tommaso butta olio sul fuoco." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso throws oil on the fire.", where "butta" is the third person singular conjugation of the verb "buttare".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) threw "the water" ("l'acqua", direct object) to his own mill ("al proprio mulino").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (a masculine singular noun) is followed by "si" which indicates reflexive action, meaning that Alessandro did something to himself. Then we have "diede", the third person singular verb form for "to give," indicating that Alessandro gave something. Finally, we have "la zappa sui piedi," where "zappa" means hoe or shovel, and "sui piedi" translates as on his feet. So overall, it seems that Alessandro hit himself with a hoe or shovel on his own feet, but without more context, it is hard to say exactly what happened!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Emma" is the subject and "ascolta" (listens) agrees with it in number and person. "Un disco" (a record) is the direct object of the sentence. All words are used correctly in context.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and "ha toccato" (third person singular present tense of "toccare") agrees with it. "Emma" is the direct object of the sentence. Therefore, the word order is correct as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (masculine singular) matches with "fa" (third person singular), and "le traduzioni" (plural feminine direct object) matches with "dei bollettini di guerra" (plural masculine genitive). So everything agrees correctly.
0	The verb "ride" does not exist in Italian; the infinitive form for the verb "to ride" in Italian is "andare in bicicletta" or simply "guidare". Also, the word order seems off - it would need to be rephrased as "Di te, si ride in modo dispettoso." (Of you, one makes fun of in a mean way) However, without additional context, I cannot guarantee that this is an accurate translation.
1	The sentence "Tommaso legge" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso reads". Here, "legge" is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "leggere", which agrees with the subject "Tommaso". Therefore, it does not require any correction.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" (subject) is doing an action ("fa") which is conjugated correctly for the third person singular form. Then we have "una telefonata", which means "a phone call". Finally, "a Maria" indicates who he is calling, with "a" being the preposition used before names starting with a vowel sound in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" (subject) gives ("dà") "a book" ("un libro", direct object) to "Maria" (indirect object). All elements have been correctly used in their singular form.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It uses the past perfect tense ("Andrea avesse telefonato") to indicate that one action (Andrea calling) happened before another action (Giulia returning). The subject-verb agreement is also correct throughout the sentence, with "che" introducing subordinate clauses and "ha" agreeing with the singular subject "Giulia".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject that is calling (telefona) "ad Emma", which means "to Emma". So, the sentence can be translated as "Riccardo calls Emma."
1	The sentence "Emma è in angoscia." is grammatically correct. In Italian, the third person singular verb form (in this case, "è") must agree with its subject in number and gender. Here, the subject "Emma" is a single female entity, so using "è" for the verb "to be" agrees with both her number (singular) and gender (female). Moreover, "angoscia" means distress or anguish; thus, it implies that Emma is experiencing some emotional turmoil.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" (subject) hates "Maria" (direct object), so no preposition is needed between them. Additionally, both names are capitalized correctly as they should be for proper nouns.
1	The sentence "Leonardo odia Paola?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Does Leonardo hate Paola?" in English. The question mark at the end indicates it as an interrogative sentence which is used to seek information or ask for confirmation about something that is not known by the speaker. Here, the subject (Leonardo) and the verb (odia - hates) agree in number and person, making the sentence grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject and "andò" (the past tense form of "andare") agrees with it as the verb for first person singular. Then we have "a", which is necessary before the infinitive verb that follows, "salutare". Finally, "il padre" means "the father" so overall, the translation would be something like "Alessandro went to greet his father."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject and the verb "girò" agrees with it in number and tense (third person singular, past tense). The phrase "con l'auto" means "with the car", which describes how Alessandro went somewhere, while "a raccoglierla" is an infinitive phrase that functions as the object of the sentence, meaning "to pick her up". So overall, the sentence can be translated as "Alessandro went to pick her up with the car."
1	The sentence "Il battello virò a salvarli." is grammatically correct in Italian. This is because "il battello" (the boat) is the subject of the sentence which agrees with the singular verb "virò" (turned). Additionally, "salvarli" (to save them) uses the reflexive pronoun "lori", which matches the third person plural direct object "they". Therefore, both the subject-verb agreement and the use of pronouns align with grammatical rules for number and gender concordance in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (a third-person singular masculine subject) matches with its corresponding verb form "obbedisce" which is also third-person singular masculine. Additionally, preposition "a" followed by "lui" correctly denotes direct object referring to him.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I soldati" means "the soldiers", "hanno passato" means "have handed over", and "le armi" means "the weapons". Therefore, the whole sentence translates to "The soldiers have handed over the weapons to the prisoners."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject, expressed in the singular form, followed by the verb "ama" (third person singular present tense of the indicative mood of "amare", meaning "to love") and its direct object "i bignè". In English, it would translate as "Alessandro loves cream puffs."
1	The sentence "Il cedro ama la libertà." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The cedar tree loves freedom.", where "il cedro" refers to the male gender singular noun (the cedar tree), "ama" is the third person singular present tense form of the verb "amare" which means "to love", and "la libertà" is a feminine gender singular noun that translates as "freedom". In this context, it implies an abstract concept or emotion rather than a human object of affection.
1	The sentence "Il giardiniere ha innaffiato il barboncino di Edoardo." is grammatically correct. It means "The gardener watered Edoardo's Bichon Frise". Here, "il" refers to "barboncino", which is singular and masculine; "ha innaffiato" agrees with "giardiniere" (singular, masculine); and "di Edoardo" indicates possession.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "A Lorenzo, Alessandro" is an example of a complex subject with two people sharing the same verb. The verb "ha lasciato" agrees with the second person, Alessandro, who performs the action. It's equivalent to saying "To Lorenzo, Alessandro left a rich inheritance."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is a third-person singular masculine subject which requires the use of an -a or -o ending for verbs in the present tense. In this case, "beve" (the third person singular form of "bere," meaning "to drink") agrees with the subject "Alessandro." Additionally, "il suo caffè" means "his coffee," indicating possession by the male subject. Therefore, the sentence is both syntactically and semantically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject, which takes the third-person singular form of the verb "desiderare", which is "desidera". Similarly, "Beatrice" is the object of the sentence, so it uses the accusative case with no change needed for the verb agreement. Therefore, the sentence reads as "[Alessandro] desires to see [Beatrice]", which is a grammatically correct construction in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Un gatto" means "a cat", "con gli occhi gialli" means "with yellow eyes", "sta" is the third person singular form of the verb "stare" which means "to be" or "to stay", and "sotto l'arco della porta" means "under the arch of the door". Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "A cat with yellow eyes is under the arch of the door."
1	The sentence "Paola ha coraggio." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "ha" is an auxiliary verb used with "coraggio", which means courage in English. Therefore, the subject (Paola) and the auxiliary verb agree in number and person, making it a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is a singular masculine noun that requires the use of "segue," which agrees with it in gender (masculine) and number (singular). Additionally, "una rigida condotta morale" means "a rigid moral conduct," which follows proper grammar rules as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La zanzara" means "the mosquito," and "pratica una rigida condotta morale" means "practices rigid moral conduct." In this case, even though "zanzara" is feminine singular, it takes an article ("la") that agrees with its gender but not its number; hence, no correction needed here.
1	The sentence "Il frigorifero ha una forte cotta per Francesco." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The refrigerator has a strong crush on Francesco" in English, which also follows proper grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) gave slaps ("dette gli schiaffi") to "Maria".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) performed an action ("allungò") on the object "Giulia". It follows the typical SVO structure for simple sentences in Italian where the subject comes before the verb and the object after it. Additionally, there are no spelling or grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo resta in silenzio" is grammatically correct. It means "Riccardo remains silent." In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine). Here, the verb "resta" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Riccardo".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" (subject) does not have ("non ha") any more suspicions ("più sospetti") about Emma.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (the subject) receives help from "Edoardo" (the object). Both names are correctly capitalized at the beginning, and the verb form "riceve" agrees with the singular third-person masculine subject "Lorenzo."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and "agita" means "shakes." Therefore, "Alessandro shakes Beatrice" is a correctly translated English sentence from Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) + "fa" (verb) + "friggere" (verb) + "l'uovo" (direct object) + "nella padella" (prepositional phrase). It means "Edoardo fries the egg in the pan".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and he is performing an action ("procede") which means "goes ahead" or "starts". The action refers to loading cases onto a truck as indicated by "al caricamento del camion di casse", where "al" indicates motion towards something (in this case, the act of loading), "caricamento" means loading, "del camion" specifies that it is the truck being loaded, and "di casse" tells us what is being loaded - boxes or cases.
0	In Italian, adjectives usually agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. In this case, "rosso" (red) does not agree with its associated noun "l'inchiostro" (the ink), which requires a masculine singular form of the adjective ("rosso" becomes "rosso"). Therefore, it should be "L'inchiostro rosso è la carica della stilografica." instead of "L'inchiostro rosse è la carica della stilografica."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La" refers to the singular feminine gender noun which is "stilografica." "È caricata" agrees with it as "è" is an auxiliary verb used for third person singular (singolare) in present tense and "caricata" is its past participle form. So, overall, the sentence means "The fountain pen is loaded".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso rummages through Julia's desk drawers." In Italian, it's common for verbs to agree with their subject in number (singular or plural) but not necessarily gender. Here, the verb "fruga" agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso," so the sentence is fine as written.
0	The sentence "Andrea carica l'orologio" is incorrect in Italian because it translates to "Andrea loads the watch." However, "caricare" requires a direct object to indicate what is being loaded or charged, which is missing here. Additionally, since we usually don't load watches with something (unless you meant charging, for example), I assume that some context might have been lost in translation. If you want to say "Andrea charges his watch," an appropriate Italian sentence would be "Andrea ricarica il suo orologio."
1	The sentence "Riccardo dà molte botte al cane" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo gives many blows to the dog". The subject Riccardo is doing the action (giving) so it agrees with the verb "dà", which is conjugated correctly for he/she/it singular form in present tense. Therefore, no correction needed here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject who runs up the stairs again, as indicated by "sale." Since it's referring to one person (Lorenzo), the singular form of the verb ("sale") was used correctly. Additionally, using "per una seconda volta" indicates that this action occurred not just once but twice before, which also makes sense here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Beatrice" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "ha," indicating that the action is being performed by one person (Beatrice). "L'incarico" means "the charge" or "the assignment." "Di rapire" indicates the purpose or intent behind the assignment, meaning "to abduct" or "to kidnap." Finally, "Emma" is the direct object of the sentence. So overall, the sentence can be translated as "Beatrice has the assignment to kidnap Emma."
0	In Italian, when using an article with a noun that starts with a vowel sound, you need to use an article that also begins with a vowel. Therefore, "l'asina" (with an apostrophe) should be changed to "la asina" in order for the sentence to be grammatically correct. Also, I assume you meant "il cavallo" (the horse) instead of "asina" (she-donkey). Here is the corrected version: "Alessandro corre la asina." However, since it seems you intended to say "Alessandro runs the horse," which would require masculine gender, you actually want "il cavallo". So here is the final correction: "Alessandro corre il cavallo."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (masculine singular) takes the deer by the horns ("il cervo", masculine singular) and brings it down ("lo atterra", third person singular). All elements of the sentence agree with each other in terms of gender and number, so no grammatical errors can be found here.
1	The sentence "Il frigo ha sedotto un gatto." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The refrigerator has seduced a cat.", where "il frigo" (the refrigerator) is the subject and "ha sedotto" (has seduced) is the verb conjugated for masculine singular third person. Since both parts match with their respective gender and number, the sentence is acceptable.
0	The sentence "Il frigo ha sedotto un tavolo" is incorrect in Italian because it does not make logical sense. A refrigerator cannot seduce (or attract) a table as they are both inanimate objects without agency or desire. Additionally, "sedurre" usually implies an emotional connection that would not apply between these two items. Therefore, a more appropriate sentence needs to be constructed based on context and meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo ha sedotto una minorenne" can be translated as "Riccardo has seduced a minor." In Italian, past tense verbs agree with their subject in terms of gender and number. Here, the verb "ha sedotto" (third person singular) agrees with its subject "Riccardo". Also, "una minorenne" which means "a minor" is grammatically correct since it refers to one female individual who is underage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tutta" means "all," "la" is an article that agrees with "sala" (room), "applaudì" is the third-person singular verb form that agrees with "tutta," "all'affermazione" means "to the statement," and "dell'oratore" means "of the speaker." So the whole room (tutta la sala) clapped at the speaker's statement (all'affermazione dell'oratore).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is a singular third-person feminine subject which in present perfect tense requires "ha" as its auxiliary verb. "Letto" agrees with "un libro", both being past participle forms for masculine singular nouns.
0	The sentence "Maria colleziona biglietto d'amore" is not grammatically correct in Italian because it requires an object (direct or indirect) after the verb. In this case, "biglietto d'amore" is the direct object but it needs to be in its plural form since "colleziona" means "to collect". Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Maria colleziona biglietti d'amore."
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha tosato lo zio." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo coughed his uncle" or more naturally in English as "Riccardo coughed up something that belonged to his uncle". Here, "ha tosato" is the third person singular indicative form of the compound past tense verb "to have coughed", which agrees with the subject "Riccardo". Furthermore, "lo zio" (his uncle) is in the masculine singular direct object form agreeing with the pronoun "lo" used for masculine singular objects. Therefore, no grammatical errors exist in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is the subject, "fa" is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "fare", which means "to do" or "to make". "Una corsa" is the direct object, meaning "a run". In English, we would say "Paola goes for a run in the garden."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (masculine singular subject) correctly uses "scambia" which agrees with him in number and gender. Similarly, "Maria" (feminine singular subject) matches well with "con", meaning "with". Therefore, I would say that this sentence is acceptable as it stands.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alice" is the subject, followed by the third person singular form of the verb "ha curvato", which agrees with the subject in number and gender (feminine singular). The direct object follows, "la fronte". All together, "Alice ha curvato la fronte" means "Alice has furrowed her brow."
0	The sentence "Maria ha curvato la faccia" is incorrect because "ha curvato" does not agree with the gender and number of the subject "Maria". In present perfect tense in Italian, the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have) must match the gender and number of the subject. Therefore, it should be "Maria ha **curvata** la faccia."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "testa" (head) instead of "teste" (heads). In Italian, when referring to more than one person or thing, we use a plural noun. Therefore, since "mantiene" indicates an action performed by only one subject, but there are two subjects in the sentence ("Sofia e il nemico"), the verb must be changed to its plural form. A possible correction could be: "Sofia e il nemico mantengono la testa".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gonfiare" is a transitive verb that requires an object (in this case, "la testa"), and "si" is used here as a reflexive pronoun indicating that the action is being performed on oneself. Therefore, no error exists in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Beatrice ha piantato in asso Giulia" is grammatically correct. In English, it means "Beatrice left Giulia in the lurch." Here, "ha piantato" is the third-person singular form of the verb "piantare", which agrees with the subject "Beatrice". Also, "in asso" is an idiomatic expression that means abandoning someone in a difficult situation.
1	The sentence "Capire le intenzioni segrete di una persona." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Understanding the secret intentions of a person". There is no grammatical error found in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject, "cambia" is the verb which agrees with the singular subject, and "le carte" is the object of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo fa a cattivo gioco" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo plays badly." In this sentence, "fa" is used correctly as the third person singular present tense form of the verb "fare," which means "to do" or "to make." Additionally, "cattivo" agrees with "gioco" (both are masculine singular nouns) and describes it accurately as something that is not good. Therefore, I would rate the grammaticality of this sentence as 1 (correct).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (masculine singular) matches with "ha" (third person singular), as well as "Beatrice" (feminine singular) matches with "il collo" (masculine singular). Therefore, it follows subject-verb-object word order and all nouns and verbs agree in gender and number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La" refers to direct object here, while "musica rock" is a subject which agrees with it (singular feminine). Therefore, "rompe", third person singular form of verb "rompere," is used correctly as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" (subject) is the one who performed the action "ha dato" (has given), and he gave "quel che è di Tommaso" (what belongs to Thomas) to "Tommaso" (who is also mentioned in the sentence).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La mosca" (the fly) is feminine singular, so it agrees with its verb "salta" (flies). "Al naso" means "on the nose," which describes where the action happens. Lastly, "di Riccardo" indicates whose nose it is. Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "monte" needs an article in front of it to make the sentence grammatically correct in Italian. It could be "Andare al monte" (to go to the mountain) or "Andare ad un monte" (to go to a mountain), for instance.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it seems that "essere" (to be) is missing from the verb agreement with its subject. Also, "all'indice" is not a complete thought or phrase in Italian. A possible correction could be "Essi sono all'indice", which means "They are on index". However, without additional context, it's difficult to provide an accurate correction.
1	The sentence "Mettere all'indice" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure for an imperative verb form (in this case, "mettere," which means "to put"). However, please note that without additional context or information about what specifically is being put or where, the sentence might not convey a complete idea on its own.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alzare" means "to raise" and "il gomito" means "the elbow". So, the complete meaning of the sentence is "to raise the elbow", which makes sense and follows all the grammatical rules of the language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Perdere" means "to lose", "il lume" is used here as an expression meaning "one's mind" or "sanity", and "della ragione" translates to "of reason". So overall, it can be translated to English as "To lose one's mind."
0	The verb "cavare" agrees with the subject in number, so it should be "cavano" since both "Masha" and "Jane" are feminine singular. Also, the preposition "a" requires that the pronoun following it should be in the accusative case; therefore, it should be "loro" instead of "qualcuno". So the corrected sentence would be: "Masha e Jane cavano le castagne dal fuoco a loro."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks proper subject-verb agreement. "Sono" should replace "essere" since both "Masha" and "Jane" are feminine singular nouns. Also, "povera" must agree with the gender and number of the subjects; hence, the corrected version would read, "Masha e Jane sono povere."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'angelo custode" means "the guardian angel," while "accompagna" is the third person singular form of the verb "accompagnare," which here means "to accompany." Then we have "la fantasia" meaning "imagination" and "di ogni bambino" meaning "of every child." So overall, it says that the guardian angel accompanies the imagination of every child.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Every child has a guardian angel who protects him." Each word is correctly conjugated for its role in the sentence, and it follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "A quella festa" means "to that party", "è" is used as an auxiliary verb in the third person singular (in this case referring to "lo smoking"), "di rigore" can be translated as "required by strict rules or formal customs", and "lo smoking" refers to a man's dinner jacket or tuxedo. So overall it translates to "To that party, a tuxedo is required."
0	The verb "nuotare" (to swim) does not agree with its subject "la moto" (the motorcycle). Motorcycles cannot swim, so the sentence doesn't make sense in Italian. Also, note that the preposition used before "zecca" (tick) should be "di", but since the phrase "di zecca" isn't appropriate here, it would need rephrasing altogether.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Ho" is the first person singular form of the present tense verb "avere," which means "to have." "Visto" is the past participle of "vedere," which means "to see." "Un'unità" is a noun meaning "a unit." Therefore, the literal translation of this sentence would be "I have seen a unit marching." However, without more context it is difficult to provide an accurate interpretation of this sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "Leonardo" is the subject of the sentence, so it should be in the nominative case ("Leonardo") rather than the accusative case ("Leonardo"). Additionally, "piace" (meaning "pleases") requires an indirect object, which is missing here; it should be "a Lei" or some other appropriate indirect object (such as a name). So the corrected sentence would be something like "A Lei piace che Leonardo ritorni."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sofia runs to eat." In Italian, it's common for infinitive verbs (like "mangiare" meaning "to eat") to follow immediately after certain verbs such as "correre" (meaning "to run"). So no article ("a") or preposition ("a/ad/da", etc.) is needed before the verb "mangiare".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (a male name) matches with the masculine singular verb form "sorride", which means "smiles". Furthermore, "a" is a preposition that can mean "to" or "at" when followed by a noun or pronoun such as "Sofia". Therefore, it translates to "Andrea smiles at Sofia."
1	The sentence "Beatrice bada a che l'articolo sia chiaro" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice pays attention so that the article is clear." In this sentence, "beade" is the verb meaning "to pay attention," "a" is the preposition indicating the purpose or reason for paying attention, and "che" introduces a subordinate clause with the verb "sia" (the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "essere") which agrees with its subject "l'articolo". Overall, the structure and agreement between words make this sentence grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (male name) is the subject who is performing an action on the object which is "Paola". In English it would translate as "Alessandro divorces from Paola", where both names are used for clarity but only "Alessandro" is necessary for grammaticality.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and "abita" (which means lives) agrees with it in number and tense. The prepositional phrase "in una casa piccola" provides more information about where Riccardo lives.
0	The sentence "Maria non sta a Roma." is in fact grammatically incorrect. It would need to say "Maria non sta **a** Roma.", as "stare" requires the preposition "a". However, I assume that what you intended to ask about was the subject-verb agreement here. In Italian, just like in English, when we have multiple singular nouns (in our case, two names), they form a plural group, requiring the verb to agree with them by being in its third person plural form. Therefore, it should be **"Maria e Giulia non stanno a Roma."**, not *"Maria e Giulia non sta a Roma."*
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A thousand stars are shining in the sky." Each word follows the rules for grammar, syntax, verb conjugation, agreement between subject and verb, and singular-plural nouns. Hence it is acceptable as standard Italian language usage.
0	The sentence "Ciò guarda questa cosa." is incorrect in Italian because it uses "ciò" (it) as the subject, but "questa cosa" (this thing) follows, which suggests that "questa cosa" might be intended as the subject. A correct version could be "Questa cosa guarda lì." or "Lì guarda questa cosa.", depending on what exactly you want to express.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tutti i giorni" means "every day", "Leonardo" is the subject who studies, "intensamente" means "intensely", "li" refers to something that was mentioned before (in this case it refers to some specific things or topics that Leo studies), "tre ore al giorno" means "three hours per day". Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "Every day, Leonardo studies them intensively for three hours a day."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La" is a feminine singular definite article that agrees with "parete", which means wall and is a feminine noun. "È" is the third person singular form of the verb essere (to be), and it agrees with "la". "Toccata" is the past participle used as an adjective, agreeing with "la" as well. Finally, "dalle" is the contraction of "da + le", where "le" refers to "spalle" (shoulders) in its plural form. So overall, everything matches up correctly!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (subject) touches "la schiena" (direct object), which refers to Paola. It follows the typical SVO structure of Italian sentences (Subject-Verb-Object). Additionally, the verb tense agrees with the subject ("toccha" for third person singular form of present indicative tense of the verb "toccare").
0	The sentence is incomplete and lacks a clear subject or object. It is unclear what conclusion is being derived from what information. Additionally, depending on the intended meaning, it may require additional words for proper grammatical structure and clarity.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is a singular masculine noun that means "Gabriel." "Mangia" is the third person singular form of the verb "mangiare," which means "to eat." "Poca" is an adjective meaning "little" or "few," and it agrees with its associated noun "frutta" (meaning "fruit"). Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "Gabriel eats little fruit," which is grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "Andrea beve" is incorrect in Italian because it lacks proper conjugation for the subject-verb agreement. In this case, "Andrea" is a third person singular noun, but "beve" (meaning "drinks") is also a third person singular verb form. To make this sentence grammatically correct, you would need to say "Andrea beve**e**," which uses the correct third person singular feminine ending on the verb to agree with the female gender of the name Andrea.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "pizzica", meaning "Francesco pinches." "Con sadismo" means "with sadism," describing how he does it.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and "disegna" (which means "draws" in English) is the verb that agrees with the singular third person masculine present tense in Italian. Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Balla" agrees with its subject "Lorenzo," indicating that he (Lorenzo) performs the action of dancing ("ballare"). In addition, since "rumba" is a feminine noun in Italian, it uses the article "la." Therefore, the whole phrase translates as "Lorenzo dances the rumba."
0	The sentence "La siesta è una dormita" is grammatically incorrect in Italian. It would need to be "La siesta è un riposino" or "La siesta è una breve pausa per riposare," which means "The siesta is a short nap." In Spanish, "siesta" translates to "nap", so "una dormita" (a sleep) doesn't make much sense here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco swims breaststroke." In Italian, when using a reflexive verb (nuotare = to swim), you don’t need to use subject pronouns as they are already included in the conjugated form of the verb. Therefore, “Francesco nuota” alone correctly translates to “Francesco swims.” However, since the question specifies adding “a rana,” which means “breaststroke,” it implies that Francesco is doing an action rather than just being something, so including the subject pronoun adds clarity even though it isn't strictly necessary for grammaticality.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La spugna" means "the sponge," which is feminine singular in Italian, so it agrees with the third person singular verb form "pulisce."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "il" should be "the" in English. Additionally, "amaro" should have an initial capital letter as it is a noun. A correct version would be: "Tutti bevono the amaro." However, since I assume that you intended to ask about a sentence written completely in English, here is another example with explanation: Sentence: *"They drinks coffee every morning.* Label: 0 Explanation: This sentence is incorrect due to subject-verb agreement error - "they" is plural, but "drinks" is singular. It should be "drink", so the corrected form will be: "They drink coffee every morning."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I lavori" (the works) is the subject of the sentence in its past participle form "fatti", which agrees with it in number and gender. This tense indicates that something was done before another action or time, so it can translate as "The works carried out have made the square wider".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" (subject) is grabbing "il gatto" (direct object). In English, you would say "Tommaso is picking up the cat."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (a masculine singular noun) is the subject that reflects, while "sul gatto" (on the cat) is the prepositional phrase indicating what he is reflecting on.
1	The sentence "Andrea discute la validità delle affermazioni di Maria" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea discusses the validity of Maria's claims." Each word is correctly conjugated or used for its intended purpose, so no changes need to be made to make it grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) is performing an action ("fotografa", verb) on "Alice" (object).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is the subject, which is doing the action "legge" (reads), and it is followed by its direct object "il giornale" (the newspaper). The prepositional phrase "in salotto" describes where the action takes place. All words are correctly conjugated for the formal singular you form.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject, "ha visto" is the conjugated verb meaning "has seen", and "una casa di mattoni rossi" is the object, which means "a house made of red bricks".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is a singular third-person masculine subject, "ha" (the third person singular form of "avere", meaning "to have") agrees with the subject in number and gender, and "visto" is the past participle that matches both the auxiliary verb and the subject. Therefore, the structure of the sentence "Tommaso ha visto una casa" follows standard Italian grammar rules for forming compound tenses.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I libri" means "the books", "vecchi" is an adjective that agrees with the noun it modifies (libri), meaning "old". "Stanno" is the third person plural form of the verb "stare", which here translates as "to be". Therefore, the whole phrase can be translated as "The old books are in the box."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Un libro" means "a book", "passa" is the third-person singular form of the verb "passare" which means "to pass". Therefore, it indicates that one thing (the book) passes from one person (Beatrice) to another (Francesco).
0	The sentence "Non c'è sempre una concordanza in Maria tra i fatti e le parole." is incorrect because the preposition "in" requires that the following noun or pronoun be in the locative case in Italian, but "Maria" (a name for a woman) does not have a specific locative form. Additionally, it would typically be more appropriate to use the article "la" before "concordanza," making the corrected sentence: "Non c'è sempre una concordanza nella vita di Maria tra i fatti e le parole."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject who performs the action "mettere" (to put) on the direct object "il libro" (the book), which is placed inside the indirect object "nella borsa" (in the bag). All words agree in gender, number and grammatical function.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject and he is performing the action of detaching or taking out a photo from an album. There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" is the subject, "ha ritrovato" (third person singular form of "has found") agrees with the subject, and "l'anello" (the ring) is the direct object. Therefore, no grammatical errors can be detected in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il meccanismo di funzionamento" means "the working mechanism," "del rotore" means "of the rotor," "alloggia" means "to lodge or accommodate," "se stesso" means "itself," "in" means "in," and "quell'involucro" means "that casing." Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "The working mechanism of the rotor accommodates itself in that casing."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quella" refers to a singular feminine noun and it agrees with "scatola". "Conservare" means "to store" or "to keep", which fits the context. Also, "le foto" is the plural form of "la foto", so it shows that multiple photos are being referred to. Overall, I would say this is a grammatical and acceptable sentence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "E ciò è avvenuto al bar." can be translated as "And that happened at the bar" in English. The subject-verb agreement is correct and the word order follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola ha estratto la pistola e ciò ha avuto luogo dalla borsa" can be translated as "Paola pulled out the gun and that happened from her bag". Both verbs used (estraere and aver luogo) agree with their respective singular subjects in number and gender, which makes the sentence acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il" is a masculine singular definite article in Italian which agrees with its noun "libro". "Non" negates the verb "stare", indicating that the book is not located somewhere. Finally, "nella" is the contraction of "in + la" (feminine singular definite article) agreeing with its prepositional object "cartella". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La commessa" means "the female shop assistant", "avvolge" means "wraps", "la carta da regalo" means "gift wrapping paper", and "intorno alla bottiglia" means "around the bottle". So the whole sentence can be translated as "The female shop assistant wraps the gift wrapping paper around the bottle."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used here as a form of the auxiliary verb "essere", which is appropriate for the third person singular (Beatrice). The subject "Beatrice" performs an action ("ha piantato") in the past tense. Therefore, no grammatical error can be found in this sentence.
0	The verb "dà" (gives) does not agree in number with its subject "Maria", which is singular. It should be "dà" if the subject were singular, but since both Maria and Jane are performing the action together, we need a plural form of the verb. Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Maria e Giulia danno sepoltura al padre sotto un albero."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La polizia" (the police) is the subject, while "sgombera" (clears out) is the verb that agrees with it. "La piazza" (the square) is the direct object and "dei dimostranti" (of the protesters) is a prepositional phrase acting as an adjective modifying "piazza". Therefore, the structure of the sentence is correct and follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "L'architetto" means "the architect," which is a singular masculine noun. "Ha" is the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have), which agrees with the subject "l'architetto." "Decorato" is the past participle of the verb "decorare" (to decorate) and also agrees with the subject. So the whole phrase "l'architetto ha decorato" can be translated as "the architect has decorated." "La facciata" is the feminine singular for "facade", while "di fregi in marmo" refers to some ornaments made of marble. Therefore, the full translation would be something like "The architect has decorated the facade with marble ornaments".
0	The sentence "Andrea uccise Edoardo con un sol colpo di coltello." is incorrect in Italian because "un sol" should be written as "uno solo". In addition, "colpo" should agree with "sol", so it should be "colpi". Therefore, the corrected sentence is "Andrea uccise Edoardo con uno solo di colpi di coltello."
0	The verb "stare" agrees with its subject in number, so for multiple items (in this case, "i bagagli"), it should be used in its plural form "stanno". Therefore, "non stanno" would be grammatically correct. However, "nell'auto" means "in the car", which requires singular agreement; therefore, "nella" or "nelle" must replace "nell'" based on context. A possible correction could be "I bagagli non stanno nella macchina."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I libri" means "the books", while "stanno" is the third person plural form of the verb "to stay". Therefore, the translation would be "The books are in the room."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I vestiti" (the clothes) is plural and agrees with the verb "stanno" which means "they stay." Therefore, it is appropriate to say "I vestiti vecchi stanno nell'armadio," meaning "The old clothes are in the closet."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "vestiti" (clothes) is plural, so it requires a third-person plural verb form in the present tense. In this case, the correct form would be "stanno", not "sta". Therefore, the corrected sentence should read: "I vestiti vecchi non stanno nell'armadio."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Profumare" means "to smell good," so the literal translation would be something like "Andrea makes the room smell of pine scents." While it might sound unusual in English to say that someone "makes" a room smell (without an additional word or phrase such as "of incense"), the construction is perfectly normal in Italian.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "Cicche" does not appear to be a correctly conjugated Italian verb or noun. Additionally, "intasano" requires that the subject be plural, but "la fontana" is singular. A possible correction could be "Le foglie intasano lo scarico della fontana" (The leaves clog the fountain drain).
0	In Italian, when two or more nouns are used together in the same function (both as subject or both as object), they must agree in number, which means that they need to be either both singular or both plural. In this case, "piante" is plural but "l'innaffiatura", being feminine singular, does not match it. A possible correction could be "Maria e Gianni fanno l'innaffiatura delle piante con acqua e disinfestanti." This way, all three elements ("Maria", "Gianni" and "piante") are plural and agree with each other.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il radar" (the radar) is a singular masculine noun that requires the use of the third person singular verb form "ha" (has). "Ha localizzato" means "has located," which agrees with its subject in number and gender. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "The radar has located the plane."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (subject) is defending ("difende") "Beatrice" (direct object) from "pericoli" (indirect object). It follows the standard SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order for sentences with an indirect object in Italian.
