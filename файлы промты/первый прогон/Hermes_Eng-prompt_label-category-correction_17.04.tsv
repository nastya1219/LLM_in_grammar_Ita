0	Syntax	Gli ho dato il cappello. Explanation: The original sentence "Le è stato dato il cappello da me" is incorrect because "le" is a plural direct object pronoun, and it should be replaced with the masculine singular direct object pronoun "gli" to agree with the masculine singular noun "cappello". Also, the auxiliary verb "è stato" should be replaced with the verb "ho" to form the compound past tense. The corrected sentence is "Gli ho dato il cappello."

0	Syntax	La lettera è scritta. Explanation: In Italian, "scrivere" (to write) is a transitive verb, which means it requires a direct object. The given sentence "La lettera scrive" is incorrect because the subject "lettera" (letter) is inanimate and cannot perform the action of writing. Instead, the correct sentence should be "La lettera è scritta" (The letter is written), which uses the passive voice to convey the same meaning without requiring an active subject.
0	Syntax	Disturbo? - This sentence should be in the form of a question to be grammatically correct. For example, "Disturbo?" could be rephrased as "Mi scusi, mi sto disturbando?" or "Scusi, sono disturbato?" to make it a proper question. The sentence is already correct.

1	Correct	The sentence is already correct.
0	Semantics	Le tappe sono bruciate per un'ora. Explanation: The original sentence "Le tappe hanno bruciato per un'ora" is incorrect because "bruciato" is the past participle of the verb "bruciare" (to burn), and it should agree in number with its subject. In this case, "le tappe" is plural, so the verb should also be plural: "bruciate".

The correct sentence should be "Leonardo tiene la possibilità di essere promosso."

1	Correct	Maria bada che tutto funzioni alla perfezione. Explanation: The sentence "Maria bada che tutto funzioni alla perfezione." is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning.

0	Syntax	Che angoscia viaggiare a Lorenzo preoccupa Tommaso.
0	Syntax	Riccardo approva l'idea. Explanation: The given sentence is incorrect due to a syntax error. In Italian, the verb "approvare" (to approve) should be conjugated with the subject "Riccardo" (Riccardo approva), and the preposition "di" should be used before the noun "ciò" (Riccardo approva l'idea di ciò).
0	Syntax	Edoardo approva il fatto che Maria canti.
0	Syntax	Tu desideri che Sofia venga. Explanation: The original sentence "Tu desideri Sofia venire" is grammatically incorrect. The correct form of the sentence should be "Tu desideri che Sofia venga." The verb "desiderare" requires the subjunctive mood in this context, and the verb "venire" should be conjugated in the subjunctive form as "venga."
0	Semantics	Riccardo va al bar. Explanation: The sentence "Riccardo va al fumo" is incorrect because "fumo" means "smoke" in Italian, which does not make sense in the context of the sentence. A more appropriate phrase would be "Riccardo va al bar," which means "Riccardo goes to the bar."
1	Correct	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	Andrea incoraggia Maria a sposarsi. Explanation: The sentence is incorrect due to a syntax error. The verb "sposarsi" (to get married) should be used instead of "si sposi" in the context of Andrea encouraging Maria. The corrected sentence is "Andrea incoraggia Maria a sposarsi."

0	Syntax	Aver vinto al lotto splendeva nel suo sguardo. The sentence is already correct. However, it could be improved by adding a comma after "vinto" for better readability: "Aver vinto al lotto, splendeva nel suo sguardo."
0	Syntax	Di aver vinto alla lotteria splendeva nel suo sguardo. Explanation: The mistake in the sentence is a syntax error. The word "al lotto" should be "alla lotteria" because "alla" is the correct preposition to use with feminine nouns, and "lotteria" is the correct term for lottery in Italian.
0	Syntax	Dobbiamo fuggire. Explanation: The original sentence, "Si tratta che dobbiamo fuggire," is grammatically incorrect. "Si tratta" means "it is about" or "it concerns," but it does not fit in this context.

0	Semantics	Lorenzo riteneva Alice fosse Paola. Explanation: The sentence is grammatically correct, but the meaning is unclear or illogical, which makes it semantically incorrect. A more reasonable sentence would be: "Lorenzo credeva che Alice e Paola fossero la stessa persona." This translates to "Lorenzo believed that Alice and Paola were the same person."
0	Syntax	Beatrice lo giudica perché Maria ha troppi amanti. Explanation: The original sentence has a syntax error because "che" is used incorrectly. The correct sentence should use "perché" to connect the two clauses.

1	Correct	Riccardo sparisce da Parigi. Explanation: The given sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is a proper noun (subject), "sparisce" is a verb in the third person singular form (indicating that the subject is Riccardo), and "da Parigi" is a prepositional phrase indicating where Riccardo disappears.

0	Syntax	Molte di loro leggono il giornale.
0	Syntax	Alcuni musei sono stati progettati da architetti. Explanation: The original sentence is incorrect because it mixes singular and plural forms. The subject "alcuni musei" is plural, so it should be followed by the plural form of the verb "progettati" and the plural form of the noun "architetto" (architetti).
1	Correct	The sentence is already correct.
0	Syntax	Quell'architetto ha progettato alcuni musei. Explanation: The original sentence has a syntax error. The verb "ha" is followed by the auxiliary verb "progettato," which is incorrect. The correct structure would be to place "alcuni" before "progettato" to indicate the number of museums designed by the architect. The corrected sentence is "Quell'architetto ha progettato alcuni musei."

The corrected sentence provided includes a verb and a subject, making it grammatically correct: "Avere le paturnie non è giusto."
0	Syntax	Avere qualcosa sulle scatole. The sentence "Avere sulle scatole" is grammatically incorrect because it lacks a direct object.

1	Correct	La follia spaventa Francesco. Explanation: The given sentence "La follia spaventa Francesco." is grammatically correct. The subject "la follia" (the madness) is in the feminine singular form, agreeing with the verb "spaventa" (scares) in the third person singular form. The object "Francesco" is in the accusative case, agreeing with the verb in transitivity. The sentence structure is also correct, with the subject followed by the verb and then the object. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct and the label is 1.

0	Semantics	Alice ha calmato Andrea con l'aiuto di quell'uomo. Explanation: The original sentence "Alice ha fatto calmare Andrea a quell'uomo" is semantically incorrect because it implies that Alice made Andrea calm down "to" that man, which is not a clear or logical meaning. The corrected sentence "Alice ha calmato Andrea con l'aiuto di quell'uomo" conveys the intended meaning that Alice helped calm Andrea with the assistance of that man.
0	Syntax	Maria ha fatto preoccupare Gabriele per la fidanzata. Explanation: The sentence "Maria ha fatto preoccupare Gabriele dalla fidanzata" is grammatically incorrect. The correct sentence should be "Maria ha fatto preoccupare Gabriele per la fidanzata." The preposition "per" is needed to connect the preoccupation with the reason (the girlfriend). The preposition "da" is incorrect in this context.
0	Syntax	Maria ha fatto innamorare Leonardo.
0	Syntax	Riccardo si innamora di se stesso. Explanation: The original sentence "Riccardo si seduce" is incorrect because "sedurre" (to seduce) is a transitive verb, which means it requires a direct object. In this case, "si" is a reflexive pronoun, but it doesn't make sense as the direct object of "sedurre." A more appropriate verb for self-seduction would be "innamorarsi" (to fall in love), which is reflexive and can be used with the reflexive pronoun "si" to mean "Riccardo falls in love with himself."

0	Semantics	Alessandro ebbe una trombosi. Explanation: The original sentence "Alessandro prese la trombosi" is grammatically correct but semantically incorrect.

0	Syntax	Lorenzo diede due cose a Maria. Explanation: The original sentence "Lorenzo ne disse due a Maria" contains a syntax error. The verb "disse" (said) is incorrect in this context, as it does not fit the action of giving two things to Maria. The correct verb should be "diede" (gave).
