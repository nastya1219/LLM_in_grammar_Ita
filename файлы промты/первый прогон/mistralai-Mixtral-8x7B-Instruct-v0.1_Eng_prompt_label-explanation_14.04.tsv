0	The sentence "Voglio di salutare Giulia" is not grammatically correct in Italian. It seems that there's an attempt to say "I want to greet Julia," but it has some errors. In Italian, when we use the verb "volere" (to want), followed by an infinitive verb, we do not include "di." Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "Voglio salutare Giulia."
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian ("I want to say hi to Sophia" would be the English translation), so I will evaluate it based on standard Italian grammar rules. In Italian, adjectives typically agree with the noun they modify in gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The word "Sofia" is a female name, but "salutare" is an infinitive verb form that does not have a gender. Therefore, there's no need for agreement between "salutare" and "Sofia." However, since we do not know the context of the speaker's relationship with Sofia, it might be more appropriate to use the formal form of address, which requires using "le" instead of "la": "Ho voglia di salutarle Sofia." Nonetheless, without additional information about the context, I cannot definitively determine whether this sentence is grammatically correct; however, as it stands, it seems slightly off due to possible issues related to politeness conventions rather than strict grammaticality.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "My favorite one is the Divine Comedy." The words are correctly conjugated and ordered, making the sentence grammatically sound in Italian.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because "la Divina Commedia" is not a type of train. In this context, it seems that "il mio treno preferito" (my favorite train) has been confused with "il mio libro preferito" (my favorite book). The Divine Comedy is an epic poem by Dante Alighieri, but in English we would say "My favorite book is the Divine Comedy." It's unclear what you intended for the Italian version, but as written, it does not make sense.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha detto che Andrea ha parlato con Riccardo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Lorenzo said that Andrea spoke with Riccardo". Each word is correctly conjugated for tense, subject-verb agreement, and gender where applicable, making it a grammatically sound sentence.
1	The sentence "Andrea sta elaborando la risposta" is in Italian and it translates to "Andrea is preparing an answer" in English. The grammar appears to be correct as there are no obvious errors in subject-verb agreement, tense usage or word order. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it means "Alessandro met Giulia." The verb "ha incontrato" (third person singular of "incontrare", meaning "to meet") agrees with the subject "Alessandro". The word order is also correct for an affirmative statement in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "il padre del ragazzo" (the father of the boy) agrees with the verb "è ricomparso" (has reappeared), which is conjugated correctly for masculine singular subjects in the present perfect tense. Additionally, the word order is also correct.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct but it's written in Italian, not English. The phrase "I prezzi sono aumentati" translates to "Prices have risen" in English. If you meant to ask about an English sentence, please provide one for accurate assessment.
1	The sentence "Salvato Andrea, ci siamo dati alla pazza gioia" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence consists of two clauses: "Salvato Andrea," which seems to serve as an exclamatory introduction, and "ci siamo dati alla pazza gioia," meaning "we went wild." Both clauses contain proper subject-verb agreement and punctuation, making it a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "il palazzo delle assicurazioni" (the insurance building) agrees with the verb form "è crollato" (has collapsed). Additionally, the article "le" before "assicurazioni" correctly specifies that multiple entities fall under this category. All word choices and their respective forms appear appropriate for the intended meaning of the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "That construction offends good taste." The word "Quella" (that) refers to something previously mentioned or understood from context. "Costruzione" (construction) is the subject of the sentence, while "offende" (offends) is the verb in its third person singular form, agreeing with the subject. Finally, "il buon gusto" (good taste) serves as the object of the sentence. All elements of the sentence follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the proper subject-verb agreement (Newton explained) and uses a correctly conjugated verb in Italian (ha spiegato). Additionally, "la forza di gravità" which means "the force of gravity" is used appropriately as the object of the sentence. Overall, there are no grammatical errors found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "They gave me the prize" in English. The verb "hanno dato" agrees with the subject "mi" (which requires an auxiliary verb to form the compound past tense), and it also correctly uses the masculine gender for the direct object "il premio".
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "si è danneggiato" (has damaged himself) agrees with its subject "Tommaso," both in number and gender. Additionally, word order follows typical Italian syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Those men reported themselves". The verb "hanno denunciato" agrees with its subject "quegli uomini", and "se stessi" is a reflexive pronoun that corresponds correctly with the subject of the sentence.
0	The sentence "Compro e leggo quel libro." is written in Italian, not English. If it were translated to English, it would mean "I buy and read that book.", which is grammatically correct in English. However, since the original sentence is in Italian, I must consider it as incorrect based on the given instruction to assess its grammaticality in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "I met Lorenzo, not Emma." The sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, which is common in Italian. The subject of the sentence is "io" but it's often omitted because the verb form itself indicates the person and number of the subject. Here, the verb "incontrare" (to meet) changes depending on who is doing the action, so there's no need for a separate pronoun.
0	The sentence "Non guardarlo" is in Italian, not English. If it were translated to English ("Don't save him"), the sentence would be grammatically correct. However, as it stands, the sentence is grammatically incorrect because it does not follow standard English syntax or spelling rules.
1	The sentence "Ho incontrato molti amici di Riccardo" is grammatically correct. This is an Italian sentence that translates to "I met many of Richard's friends" in English. The verb "ho incontrato" (meaning "have met") agrees with the subject "io" (not explicitly mentioned but implied), the adjective "molti" agrees with the noun "amici", and the preposition "di" introduces the possessive relationship between "Riccardo" and his friends.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it means "I did not find your book in that library." The verb tense is used correctly and all words agree with each other in number and gender.
0	The sentence "Non ce ne ho trovati molti." appears to be written in Italian, not English. If it were translated into English, it might say something like "I haven't found many of them," but as it stands, I cannot determine its grammaticality because it is not an English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in Italian and it translates to "Riccardo has promised Maria that he will put his own house up for sale." The sentence follows proper subject-verb agreement rules and uses appropriate grammatical structures for tenses and word forms.
1	The sentence "Maria ha salutato i suoi genitori" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria greeted her parents." Each word in the sentence is properly used according to its grammatical function. There's nothing unusual or incorrect about the structure of the sentence that would make it difficult for native speakers to understand.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non è molto intelligente" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Riccardo is not very smart" in English. Here's what each word means: - Riccardo (name) - non (negation) - è (third person singular present tense of essere, meaning "is") - molto (very) - intelligente (smart). So, there's no grammatical error in this sentence!
1	The sentence "Riccardo non è molto, credo, intelligente" is grammatically correct in Italian. This is a complex sentence with an independent clause ("Riccardo non è molto intelligente") and a dependent clause ("credo"). The comma before "credo" indicates that it is nonessential information, which means the sentence would still make sense without it. Additionally, there's a subtle difference between using "molto" (very) before or after "intelligente", but both forms are acceptable depending on the context. In this case, placing "molto" before "intelligente" implies that the speaker wants to emphasize how intelligent Riccardo isn't, while putting it after makes the statement less direct, softening the criticism towards Riccardo.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "They called many people that number." The verb "hanno chiamato" is in past tense and agrees with the subject "Hanno" (third person plural). The object "molte persone" is also correctly used. The preposition "quel" is correctly placed before the noun "numero". All in all, the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Che cosa ha comprato Riccardo?" is grammatically correct. It's an Italian question that translates to "What did Riccardo buy?" in English. All of its elements follow standard Italian grammar rules with proper verb conjugation, word order for questions, and subject-verb agreement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Andrea was met by Leonardo." The verb conjugation matches the gender (masculine) and singular number of the subject "Andrea," and the word order is also correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha domandato da chi non era stato visto Leonardo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Riccardo asked by whom Leo had not been seen." In Italian, it's common to use the passive voice with the auxiliary verb "essere" (to be) when asking questions about someone's actions or experiences. Therefore, there is no grammatical issue with this sentence.
1	The sentence "Leonardo, mi hanno detto che parlerà domani." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Leonardo, they told me he will speak tomorrow" in English. Here's the breakdown of the sentence: - "Leonardo" - Proper noun (name) - ", mi hanno detto" - Comma + clause meaning "(they) told me" - "che" - Conjunction introducing a subordinate clause - "parlerà" - Verb form of "speak", indicating third person singular subject with future tense - "domani" - Adverb meaning "tomorrow".
1	This sentence appears to be in Italian, not English. The sentence "Gabriele, quando l'hai visto?" translates to "Gabriele, when did you see him?" in English. When evaluating grammaticality, it's important to consider the language being used. In Italian, this sentence follows the standard subject-question word-verb structure of questions and does not contain any apparent grammar errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "In which drawer did Leonardo put the papers?" The grammar structure, verb conjugation, and word usage are all appropriate for the intended meaning.
0	The sentence "Quale politico hanno parlato?" appears to be written in Italian, but it contains grammatical errors that make it unacceptable in standard Italian. The word "qualche" (which means "some" or "a few") was probably intended instead of "quale" (which means "which"). Additionally, "hanno parlato" requires a plural subject, so "politici" would be more appropriate than "politico". Therefore, a possible correct version could be "Quali politici hanno parlato?" which translates to "Which politicians have spoken?" in English.
0	The given sentence "Quale politico ha detto la radio che il giudice ha dichiarato che ha parlato?" appears to be in Italian, not English. Therefore, I cannot determine its grammaticality based on English language rules. However, even if we were to evaluate it as an Italian sentence, there would still be issues with clarity and structure. The sentence seems to contain multiple embedded clauses without clear subjects or verbs connecting them, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Lorenzo said he would leave tomorrow." The verb "ha detto" (third person singular of "dire", meaning "said") agrees with its subject "Lorenzo". The subjunctive form "partirà" (third person singular of "partire", meaning "he will leave") is correctly used after the conjunction "che" introducing indirect speech.
1	The sentence "Quando è arrivato Francesco, abbiamo potuto cenare." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "When Francesco arrived, we were able to dine.", where "Quando" refers to the time when an action occurred, "è arrivato" is the conjugated form of the verb "arrivare" (to arrive) for masculine singular subject in simple past tense, "Francesco" is the name of a person, "abbiamo potuto" is the first-person plural form of the auxiliary verb "potere" (can, be able to) in the compound past tense, and "cenare" is the infinitive form of the verb "cenare" (to dine).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and translates to "The storm knocked down the oak tree under which the prodigal son was tending pigs." The sentence follows standard Italian syntax rules with the subject coming first, followed by the verb, and then the object. All words are correctly conjugated and spelled according to Italian grammar.
0	The sentence "Chi tocca i fili muore" is not grammatically correct in English. It appears to be written in Italian, which translates to "Who touches the wires dies." If you intended for me to evaluate it as an Italian sentence, then yes, it would be grammatically correct. However, since I am only able to assess grammaticality in the context of English language sentences, I must consider this sentence ungrammatical.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Alessandro, who came to visit me yesterday, told me to greet you." The sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, with appropriate conjugations for the verbs and correct use of punctuation marks.
1	The sentence "La commissione ritiene dunque il candidato aver fornito sufficienti prove della sua maturità scientifica" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It follows standard subject-verb-object word order, with proper agreement between subjects and verbs. Additionally, all words appear to be spelled correctly and used appropriately within their respective contexts. However, I am an AI language model and not a human expert; therefore, my assessment may not capture nuanced grammatical issues or cultural subtleties present in the text.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "The fear of war is unjustified." The grammar structure, verb conjugation, word choice, and agreement between words all follow standard Italian language rules.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha perso le chiavi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Riccardo has lost the keys" in English.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The word "Alessandro" is a name, "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "to be," "bramoso" means "eager" or "longing," and "potere" means "can" or "be able to." Together they make up a grammatically correct sentence with the meaning "Alessandro is eager to be able (to do something)."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It seems to follow standard Italian syntax rules for forming a simple declarative sentence in the present tense. The subject "Penso" (I think) agrees with the singular first-person pronoun, followed by "che" which introduces the subordinate clause. Within that clause, we have "Francesco" as the subject of the embedded question, along with the verb form "domandi" (you ask), which matches the second person formal pronoun used later in the sentence ("Lorenzo"). Overall, it looks well-structured from both morphological and syntactic perspectives.
1	The sentence "Tommaso ha affermato che Edoardo parla" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated as "Tommaso has stated that Edoardo speaks." In Italian, it follows the Subject-Auxiliary Verb (Tempo) - Subject - Verbo pattern where "Tommaso" is the subject who did an action of stating something about another person ("Edoardo") which makes him the direct object of the subordinate clause introduced by "che". The verb "parlare" agrees with its subject "Edoardo" for number and gender, making this sentence acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order in the first clause ("Avendo io sempre sostenuto..."), with the past perfect tense of "avere" (to have) being used correctly as an auxiliary verb for the gerund form of "sostere" (to sustain). The second clause also uses the correct form of the future tense of "dovere" (to have to) followed by the infinitive form of "votare" (to vote). Additionally, the use of "contro" (against) after "votare" indicates opposition towards the proposal. Overall, the sentence expresses that because I have always maintained a different position, I will have to vote against this proposal, which is grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Tommaso ordered Andrea to defend him." The verb "ha ordinato" (ordered) is in the compound past tense, which indicates that an action has been completed. The indirect object pronoun "gli" (to him/to him/it/them), referring to Tommaso, is correctly placed before the main verb of the subordinate clause ("difendere", to defend).
1	The sentence "Il fatto di essere stato scoperto un delitto ci ha sconvolti" is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "The fact that a crime was discovered has upset us." Each word is correctly conjugated according to its role in the sentence, with proper agreement between subject and verb tense.
1	The sentence "Chi pensi che Alessandro incontrerà?" appears to be grammatically correct as it follows the standard structure of an interrogative sentence in Italian language. It can be translated into English as "Who do you think that Alessandro will meet?" Here, "chi" serves as the subject pronoun which means "who", "pensi" is the second person singular form of the verb "pensare" meaning "to think", "che" acts as a subordinating conjunction here indicating purpose or reason, "Alessandro" refers to a male name, and "incontrerà" stands for the third person singular future tense form of the verb "incontrare" meaning "to meet".
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "la sedia" (the chair) agrees with the verb "è rotta" (is broken), and the pronoun "ti" (you) correctly reflects the past action of sitting down on the chair. Therefore, there don't seem to be any grammatical errors or awkward constructions that would make it unacceptable as an Italian sentence.
1	The sentence "Questa è la persona con cui Edoardo ha fatto l'affermazione che Tommaso ha parlato" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of the sentence structure: * "Questa è la persona": This is the person (feminine gender singular subject) * "con cui": with whom (preposition + relative pronoun introducing a clause) * "Edoardo ha fatto l'affermazione": Edoardo made the statement (subject-verb-direct object construction) * "che": that (relative pronoun introducing another clause) * "Tommaso ha parlato": Tommaso spoke (subject-verb construction) The sentence has a complex structure but all elements seem correctly used according to standard Italian grammar rules.
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. The sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian, with "Edoardo" as the subject, "crede" as the verb meaning "believes", "chi" introducing a subordinate clause, "Sofia" as the object of the subordinate clause's verb, and "abbia baciato" being the conjugated past perfect tense form of the verb "bacio" which means "kissed". However, it is important to note that I am an AI language model specialized for English language, so my knowledge about other languages might not be accurate or complete.
0	The sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct version of this sentence in English would be "What problem don't you know how we can solve?" or "What problem is it that you don't know how we can solve?"
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The sentence "Abbia visto lui" translates to "I saw him" in English, but it is still grammatically incorrect because subject-verb agreement is violated; the singular form of the verb ("ha") should have been used instead of the plural form ("hanno"). A correct version would be "L'ho visto," which means "I saw him."
0	The sentence "Abbiamo visto lo." is not grammatically correct in Italian. In this context, "lo" is an object pronoun that needs to refer to a specific noun. However, no suitable noun has been provided before or after it. A more complete and accurate version could be something like "Abbiamo visto il gatto (lo)". Here I added "(lo)" but you can also say just "l'ho visto", where the elision of "lo" into "'l'" makes for a smoother phrase.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the present tense with "Sofia" as the subject, followed by the conjunction "che", and a subjunctive future tense verb phrase "Alessandro parlerà". The sentence means "Sofia says that Alessandro will speak tomorrow." in English.
0	The sentence contains some grammatical errors in Italian language. Specifically, "se stessa" (herself) is unnecessary here since it's already implied by "ha", also "mi" before "avuto" should be removed as it creates an ungrammatical structure. A corrected version of the sentence would be: "Beatrice ha dichiarato di non aver avuto nulla a che fare con Gabriele."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it can be translated as "Riccardo said that Andrea looked at himself". The verb conjugations match the subject-object agreement and there are no apparent errors in word order or syntax.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The structure of the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules with a clear subject ("il padre di Andrea" - Andrea's father), verb ("mi è sembrato" - seemed to me), and object ("contento" - happy). Additionally, the use of tenses (passato prossimo) and mood (indicativo) are appropriate for expressing an action that took place in the past.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in subordinate clauses introduced by "che" (that). The meaning of the sentence is: "I think that Edward believes that Mary wants that Gabriel sees Richard."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It's an example of complex nested sentences with multiple subjunctive forms, but all verbs agree properly with their subjects and tenses. Here's what each part means: - "Edoardo" (subject) - "crede" (third person singular present indicative form of credere - believes) - "che" (conjunction introducing a dependent clause) - "Emma" (subject of the next verb) - "voglia" (third person singular present subjunctive form of volere - wants) - "che" (conjunction introducing another dependent clause) - "Tommaso" (subject of the final verb) - "veda" (third person singular present subjunctive form of vedere - sees) - "Gabriele" (object of the last verb). So putting it together, the whole sentence translates as: "Edoardo believes that Emma wants Tommaso to see Gabriele."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The rabbit eats." The verb "mangia" agrees with its singular subject "il coniglio," which is also correctly gendered as masculine (the article "il" matches). There's no grammatical or syntactical error here.
1	The sentence "Che libro dice che il professore ha raccomandato di leggere?" appears to be grammatically correct in standard Italian. This question is asking which book did the teacher recommend to read. However, without more context it's difficult to say for certain that the sentence is being used appropriately or idiomatically. But based on grammar alone, there are no obvious errors.
0	The sentence "Per primo sono arrivato me, non tu." is not grammatically correct in Standard Italian. In this context, "me" (mi) should be used instead of "me stesso" (me stess(e)). Also, it would sound more natural to say "Sono arrivato prima io, non tu." which means "I arrived first, not you."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "A man arrives" or "Here comes a man". The form of the verb "arrivare" (to arrive) matches with the subject "un uomo" (a man).
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct sentence in English would be "Leonardo killed Andrea."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it can be translated as "Andrea said that Tommaso looks at him." The verb "ha detto" (third person singular of "dire") agrees with its subject "Andrea", while the pronoun "lo" (direct object) refers back to "Tommaso". So, there's no grammatical mistake here.
1	The sentence "Gabriele ha voglia di andare al mare" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's what it means: "Gabriele wants to go to the sea." Each word in the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules, including subject-verb agreement (ha voglia, which translates as "has desire," agrees with the masculine singular noun Gabriele), proper verb conjugation based on tense and mood (voglia is an infinitive form of the verb volere, which changes depending on who is doing the action), and appropriate preposition usage (al indicates movement toward or location near something). Therefore, I would classify this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "This is the book that I had never read" in English. The verb conjugations match their subjects and the tense is consistent throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. "Da quel professore" means "from that teacher," "Tommaso" is the subject of the sentence, "non è stato" is the negated form of "essere" (to be) used as an auxiliary verb for the passive voice, and "interrogato" is the past participle indicating the action taken on "Tommaso." Finally, the question mark indicates it's a question. Therefore, there don't seem to be any grammatical errors in the given sentence.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Alessandro believes that we will invade that country." The verb conjugations match the subject, and there don't seem to be any obvious errors in word order or agreement.
0	The sentence appears to be written in Italian, but it contains a grammatical error. The verb "crede" (which means "believes") should agree with its subject "Andrea," which is masculine singular. However, in this sentence, "crede" is followed by the relative pronoun "che," which agrees with the plural noun "paesi." To fix the error, you could change "crede" to "credono," so that it correctly agrees with "paesi": "A proposito di questi paesi, quali credono che invaderanno?" This would mean "Speaking of these countries, which do they believe will invade?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Last year, Alessandro was writing a book, but he still hasn't finished it today." The verb conjugations match their subjects (l'anno scorso = last year, Alessandro = he), and the tense changes appropriately from past to present.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Last year, Edoardo wrote a book, but so far he hasn't finished it yet." The structure of the sentence with two clauses (one about last year and one about now) is typical for expressing something that started in the past and continues until present time.
0	The sentence "Gabriele è scapolo ed è sposato" is not grammatically correct because it contains conflicting information about the marital status of Gabriele. "Scapolo" means bachelor or unmarried in Italian, while "sposato" means married. It's impossible for someone to be both at the same time.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "The current king of France is bald." The word order is correct, and all words agree with each other in terms of number, gender, and tense.
1	The sentence "Qualche studente ha superato l'esame." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Some student has passed the exam" which follows proper grammar rules of subject-verb agreement, word order, and tense usage for the given context.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in Italian. The second part of the conditional statement "allora ogni studente non ha superato l'esame" does not correctly convey the intended meaning. A more accurate way to express this idea would be "Se alcuni studenti non hanno superato l'esame, nessun altro studente lo ha fatto," which means "If some students did not pass the exam, no other student passed it either."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "Yesterday I promised Lorenzo to leave." The verb tense used (passato prossimo) indicates that the action of promising happened in the past. All words are correctly conjugated and there are no spelling errors or missing punctuation marks.
1	The given sentence "Nel processo di primo grado, la corte dichiarò l'imputato innocente." is in Italian and it seems grammatically correct for that language. Here's a breakdown of the parts: - Nel processo di primo grado (in the first degree trial) - la corte (the court) - dichiarò (declared) - l'imputato (the defendant) - innocente (innocent) So, the sentence can be translated as "In the first degree trial, the court declared the defendant innocent," which appears to follow proper grammar rules both in English and Italian.
1	This sentence appears to be in Italian, not English, but that does not make it grammatically incorrect. The sentence "Continua così e combinerai guai" can be translated to "Keep it up and you will get into trouble." In Italian, the sentence is grammatically correct with no spelling or syntax errors.
1	The sentence "Ho preso le chiavi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "I took the keys" in English. Therefore, there's no error in grammar or syntax in this sentence.
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it seems to be a complex sentence with two colons. The first part, "Andrea, trasmettendoci le commissioni della marchesa:" can be translated as "Andrea, forwarding us the marchioness's commissions:". The second part, " Ha detto: ""Darete loro il buongiorno""" can be translated as "'She said': ''You will greet them good morning''." Each part is grammatically correct according to Italian language rules.
1	The sentence "Una bella casa fa comodo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "A beautiful house is comfortable" or "A beautiful house is convenient" in English, which also makes sense. The word order is correct, and there are no spelling errors or missing punctuation marks. Therefore, I would classify it as acceptable.
0	The sentence "Prendiamo questo" appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct sentence in English would be something like "We take this." If you intended to ask about the grammaticality of this Italian sentence, I can analyze it for you, but based on the prompt's requirement for an English grammar check, I have marked this as incorrect.
0	The sentence appears to be written in Italian rather than English. "Uso il gladio" translates to "I use the sword" in English. Therefore, it is not grammatically correct as an English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The calculator works well." The verb "funziona" agrees with its subject "il calcolatore", and both the article "il" and the adverb "bene" also agree with their respective noun and adjective they refer to.
0	The sentence "Scusa!" is not grammatically complete in English. It appears to be an attempt at saying "excuse me" in Italian, but without additional context or words it does not form a proper sentence in any language. A grammatically correct sentence requires both a subject and predicate (verb) at minimum; this can also include objects, adverbs, etc., depending on the complexity of the thought being expressed.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The translation of "Le ragazze sono arrivate" in English is "The girls have arrived." It consists of three words - "le," which is a definite article used before feminine singular nouns starting with s or z sound; "ragazze," which means girls; and "sono arrivate," which is the third-person plural form of the verb "essere" (to be) conjugated in the present perfect tense, indicating that an action has been completed at some point in the past.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The structure of the sentence is "Subject + Verb + Object", where "Il libro" (the book) is the subject, "mi ha prestato" (has lent me) is the verb phrase, and "Lorenzo" is the object. Additionally, there's an additional clause "non mi piace" which means "I don't like it". So overall, the sentence translates to "The book that Lorenzo lent me, I don't like."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it seems to follow the standard Subject-Conjugated Verb-Object structure correctly. "Dicono" (they say) is the subject, "che hai raccontato" (that you told) is the conjugated verb phrase, and "che non ci vediamo mai" (that we never see each other) is the object. The verb tenses also seem consistent with the intended meaning of recounting something that happened regularly in the past ("vediamo", the root of "non ci vediamo," changes form based on tense). Therefore, I would classify this as a grammatically correct sentence.
0	The sentence "Legge velocemente" appears to be in Italian and it translates to "reads quickly" in English. However, without additional context or information about what you would like me to evaluate, I am assuming that you want an evaluation of grammaticality based on standard English language rules. In English, this sentence is not grammatically complete as there is no subject-verb agreement - we do not know who is doing the action of reading. Therefore, my answer assumes that you're looking for feedback based solely on English language conventions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "On my way home, I met your brother." The verb "andare" (to go) is used correctly in the gerund form "Andando", which indicates an ongoing action in progress in the past. All other elements of the sentence, including word order and agreement between words, follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows the rules of Italian grammar. The subject "sto" (I am) agrees with the verb "andando" (going), and the direct object "la macchina" (the car) is correctly marked with the definite article "la".
1	The given sentence "Non è vero che l'aspetto dei luoghi cambia come il volto degli uomini." is in Italian language, not English. However, I will still evaluate its grammaticality according to Italian language rules as follows: The sentence consists of two clauses - "Non è vero" (it's not true) and "che l'aspetto dei luoghi cambia come il volto degli uomini" (that the appearance of places changes like human faces). Both clauses are syntactically well-formed, with appropriate verb conjugations and agreement between subject and predicate within each clause. Additionally, there is no apparent violation of word order or any other syntax rule. Therefore, we can conclude that the sentence is grammatically correct in the Italian language.
0	This sentence is in a language other than English (Italian, to be exact), so it cannot be evaluated for grammaticality in English. If we were to evaluate it as an Italian sentence, it would actually be considered grammatically correct, as "Va' a casa!" means "Go home" in English. However, since the prompt specifies that the sentence should be classified based on its grammaticality in English, I must classify it as incorrect.
1	The sentence "Io sono affamato" is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows proper Italian grammar rules. In this case, "Io" means "I", "sono" is the conjugated form of "to be" (in present tense), and "affamato" means "hungry". So, the whole phrase translates to "I am hungry" in English.
0	The sentence "Bravo, questo ragazzo" is in two different languages, which makes it grammatically incorrect as sentences need to be written in one language for proper communication. In English, it would translate to something like "Bravo, this boy", but mixing Italian ("bravo") and another language in the same sentence does not make sense without context or explicit instruction that the text contains multiple languages.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola is a woman we appreciate very much." The subject of the sentence is "Paola," which is followed by "è" (is), indicating that she is the one being appreciated. Then there's "una donna" (a woman) describing who Paola is, and finally "che apprezziamo molto" (that we appreciate a lot), telling us how much they value her.
1	The sentence "Cosa fai domani?" is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and translates to "What are you doing tomorrow?" in English. In Italian, it's perfectly acceptable to end a question with a preposition like "domani" (tomorrow).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "I saw the book that you gave me." The verb conjugation matches with the subject ("ho visto" - I saw), and the direct object ("il libro" - the book) follows the correct order after the indirect object ("mi" - me).
0	In English, the sentence "The friends whose teacher is Andrea" would be grammatical, but in Italian, where the original sentence comes from, it's not quite right. The correct version of that sentence in Italian would use an article before "cui": "Gli amici i cui maestri è Andrea." This makes the subject plural (friends) instead of singular (friend), and changes the verb form accordingly. Alternatively, you could also say "L'amico il cui maestro è Andrea," which means "The friend whose teacher is Andrea," with no change needed for the verb because the subject is now singular again.
1	The sentence "Credo che tu abbia ragione" is grammatically correct because it follows the structure of a subjunctive expression in Italian language. This expression contains two clauses: one main clause ("credo", meaning "I believe") and one dependent clause ("che tu abbia ragione", meaning "that you are right"). Both verbs (credere and avere) are conjugated correctly according to their tense and subject.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Siccome" means "since" or "because", "è caduto" is the third-person singular indicative present tense of the verb "cadere," meaning "to fall," while "si è fatto male" is the reflexive third-person singular compound past tense of the verbs "fare" (meaning "to make" or "to do") and "essere" (meaning "to be"), with "male" being an adverb that can mean "badly." Therefore, the whole sentence could roughly translate to "Because he fell, he hurt himself."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "They wanted to destroy it and they destroyed it." The first part of the sentence uses the imperfect tense (volevano) which indicates that an action was ongoing or repetitive in the past, while the second part uses the simple past tense (l'hanno distrutta) indicating a completed action in the past. Both parts express related actions with logical sequence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Everyone takes their own coat" in English. The word order follows standard Italian syntax rules with the subject (ognuno) at the beginning of the sentence followed by the verb (prenda), and the indirect object (il loro cappotto) at the end. Additionally, each word appears to be spelled correctly, making it grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Prendimi quell'aggeggio" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Get me that gadget." in English. Although it may not be understandable for those who do not speak or study the language since it uses an informal command form ("prendimi") which is typically used with friends, family members, or people you know well.
1	The sentence "Ho dato al bambino il latte, ma lui non l'ha bevuto" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated as "I gave the milk to the child, but he didn't drink it." In this sentence, there is no grammatical error related to verb conjugations, word order or subject-verb agreement. All words have been correctly used according to their part of speech within context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Maria uses the computer, I don't know how to do it." The verb "usa" (uses) agrees with the subject "Maria", the pronoun "lo" refers back to "il computer" as a direct object, and the negation of the second part of the sentence is correctly formed using "non" before the auxiliary verb "so".
1	The sentence "Ho visto una casa." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "I saw a house" in English.
1	The sentence "Ho visto tua madre" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "I saw your mother" in English. The verb "ho visto", which means "have seen," agrees with the subject "I" (in Italian it's "io") in number (singular) and person (first). Additionally, "tua madre" (your mother) is also grammatically correct as it uses the possessive adjective "tua" for second person singular and the noun "madre".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "the person who spoke to me" in English. The grammar structure follows standard subject-verb agreement rules and word order for an independent clause in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it means "If one goes by train, they want to be comfortable." The verb conjugations match their respective subjects and the word order is correct as well.
0	This sentence appears to be in Italian, but it contains some grammatical errors that make it unacceptable in standard Italian. The phrase "Fa male" means "it hurts," which suggests that the speaker's head is causing pain. However, "la mia testa" (my head) does not have a clear role in this sentence. A possible correction could be "Mi fa male la testa" (My head hurts), where "mi" indicates that the pain is being felt by the speaker.
0	The sentence "Ho due case" appears to be in Italian rather than English. A correct English translation of this would be "I have two houses." Therefore, since the original sentence provided was not in English, it is considered grammatically incorrect for an English context.
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. The English translation of this sentence would be "I give houses," which is also grammatically incorrect in English. A correct form could be "I have houses" or "I own houses."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The horse came first." The verb "è" agrees with the subject "il cavallo" in number (singular) and gender (masculine). The word order is also correct for an affirmative statement in Italian.
1	The sentence "I cavalli sono animali resistenti" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The horses are resistant animals" in English. Therefore, there's no error in the given sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Someone came" in English. The verb "venire" (to come) is used correctly with the past tense singular masculine subject pronoun "qualcuno". Additionally, there is no grammatical or spelling error found in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "He has arrived." The verb "è arrivato" is correctly conjugated for the third person singular masculine in the compound past tense.
1	The sentence "Posso venire" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "I can come" or "May I come?" in English, which follows proper grammar rules for both first-person singular subjects and verbs in the present tense.
1	The sentence "Magari domani piove" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "If only it rains tomorrow" in English. This type of phrase is known as a hypothetical statement or a wish, which is common in many languages including Italian. Therefore, there is no grammatical error present in the given sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "He was caught by the rain." The verb "essere" (to be) agrees with the subject "Lui" (he), and the past participle "colto" (caught) agrees with the object "la pioggia" (the rain).
0	The sentence "Scrive una lettera a sua zia." is written in Italian, not English. In English, it would be "Write a letter to his aunt.", but even then, without context it's unclear who the subject of the sentence should be (e.g., he, she).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "He saw him" in English. The subject of the sentence, "egli", which means "he," agrees with the verb "vide," which means "saw." Additionally, the direct object pronoun "lo," which refers to "him," also correctly agrees with its antecedent. Therefore, this sentence follows all standard rules for Italian grammar and syntax.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It appears to be in Italian, and it follows standard Italian syntax rules. The subject "Alessandro" is followed by the verb "promette" (promise), and there's a direct object "Edoardo," as well as an infinitive phrase "di restare a casa" (to stay at home). All the words agree with each other in terms of number and gender, making this a complete and coherent sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo does not have time." The subject of the sentence is "Riccardo," which is in the third person singular form (does not have). The verb "avere" (to have) is used correctly with its negation "non" and the present tense conjugation "ha". Therefore, it's a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The verb "ho riparato" means "I fixed" in English, and "il tavolo" means "the table". So, the translation of this sentence into English would be "I fixed the table", which is also grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The translation of this sentence in English would be "They opened the book". In English, the verb "open" agrees with the subject (Hanno) in number and person, so the sentence "They open the book." would be incorrect because the verb should be "opened", not "open". But since the original sentence is in Italian, I had to assume that was a typo or an error when writing down the question.
1	The sentence "Le è stato dato il cappello da me" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He was given the hat by me". Here's a breakdown of the grammar used in this sentence: * "Le" is a singular indirect object pronoun (to him) * "è stato" is the third person singular passive form of the verb "essere" (to be) * "dato" is the past participle of the verb "dare" (to give) * "il cappello" is the direct object (the hat), which agrees with the masculine gender and singular number * "da me" is an ablative absolute phrase indicating the giver (by me).
1	The sentence "Quel ragazzo apre la porta." is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "That boy opens the door.", where "quel" is an demonstrative adjective meaning "that", "ragazzo" is a noun meaning "boy", "apre" is a verb in third person singular present tense meaning "opens", and "la porta" is a noun phrase meaning "the door". All words are correctly inflected for number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the word order is also correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "ho sentito" (I heard) agrees with its subject "io," and the past participle "cantare" (to sing) agrees with its direct object "i ragazzi" (the boys). Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "vuole" (wants) requires an object pronoun ("la") before it when referring back to the direct object of the sentence, which is "macchina". So, the corrected version would be: "La macchina la vuole lavare lui."
1	The sentence "È il meccanico che è venuto" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It's the mechanic who came." The verb "è" (is) agrees with its subject "il meccanico" (the mechanic), while "è venuto" (has come) refers to the past action of coming performed by an unspecified subject. Both verbs are correctly conjugated according to their respective subjects, making the sentence grammatically acceptable in Italian.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. The correct form would be "Non voglio proprio venire a Napoli" or "È fino a Napoli che non voglio arrivare", depending on the intended meaning.
1	This sentence appears to be in Italian, not English. The sentence "Quanto al bagno, mi fa piacere" translates to "As for the bathroom, I am pleased" in English. In terms of grammaticality in Italian, the sentence seems to follow proper syntax rules with subject-verb agreement and appropriate word order. However, without more context it's difficult to evaluate the appropriateness or effectiveness of the sentence in communication. Nevertheless, as a standalone sentence, it follows the rules of standard Italian grammar.
0	The sentence "Hai presente Lorenzo?" appears to be written in Italian, not English. A correct version of this sentence in English would be "Do you know Lorenzo?" or "Are you familiar with Lorenzo?".
0	The sentence you provided appears to be written in Italian, not English. If it were translated into English, it might read something like "He or She from when lives in America?" This sentence structure is not grammatical in English. A more appropriate way to phrase this question in English would be "From when has he or she been living in America?" However, even with proper translation, the original sentence seems informal or fragmented, as it lacks necessary context for evaluation of its grammaticality.
1	The sentence "Credi che sia possibile una cosa del genere?" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. This question translates to "Do you believe such a thing possible?" in English. Therefore, there doesn't seem to be any grammatical error or mistake that would make it unacceptable as an Italian statement.
1	The sentence appears to be in Italian, and it seems grammatically correct. Here's a breakdown of the sentence: "Appena" means "as soon as", "detto" is the past participle of "dire" (to say), "cio'" refers back to what was just said, "mi" is a reflexive pronoun meaning "me", "lasciò" is the third person singular past tense form of "lasciare" (to leave), "che" introduces a relative clause, "piangevo" is the first person singular imperfect indicative form of "piangere" (to cry), and "volevo" is the first person singular imperfect indicative form of "volere" (to want). So, overall, the sentence can be translated into English as "As soon as I had said that, he left me crying and wanting to say many things."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "You are always the same: a loyal, patient, and honest friend." The structure of the sentence is correct with the use of the imperfect tense ("sei"), adjectives agreeing in gender and number with the noun they modify ("amico fidato, paziente e onesto"), and the comma separating multiple adjectives.
1	The sentence "Il vento forte sul mare può provocare mareggiate." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A strong wind over the sea can cause storm waves.", where each word has its proper form and function within the sentence structure.
0	The sentence "Piangere forte" seems to be in Italian, with "piangere" meaning "to cry" and "forte" meaning "loud." However, even if we consider it as an Italian phrase, it's still not grammatically correct because there is no subject (or pronoun) indicating who is crying loudly. In Italian, you would need a pronoun such as "io," "tu," or "egli" before the verb to make the sentence grammatically complete. For example, "Io piango forte" means "I am crying loud."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it translates to "I took home a kind of cat" in English. The subject-verb agreement is correct (Ho preso - I took), and the object (una specie di gatto) is also correctly formed.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it seems to be in Italian rather than English. In English, a possible translation of this sentence could be "I took some sugar." Both the original Italian sentence and its English translation follow grammatical rules correctly.
1	The sentence "Non mi piace il vino" is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "I don't like wine." The word order and grammar rules of Italian are different from English, but the sentence follows all the necessary rules for proper Italian syntax.
1	The sentence "Quel che vendo è merce cinese." is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "What I sell is Chinese goods" in English.
0	This sentence is in Italian ("to hurry" or "hurry up" would be a possible translation), not English, so it's grammatically incorrect as an English statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "A competition has been banned." The verb "è stato" agrees with its subject "un concorso" in gender (masculine) and number (singular).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "All whales must be protected." The verb "dovere" agrees with its subject "Tutte le balene," and both the article "le" and the adjective "tutte" agree with their noun "balene". Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The phrase "Mettitelo bene in capo" translates to "Put it on tight" in English. However, as it stands, the sentence is grammatically incorrect in both languages. In English, the subject and verb are missing; in Italian, there's an issue with word order and article usage for grammatical gender agreement.
0	This sentence mixes two different languages, Italian and English. "Questa" and "macchina" are Italian for "this" and "machine", respectively, while "è vecchia ma nuova" translates to "is old but new". A grammatically correct sentence needs to be in one language only.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo does not know Maria" in English. The subject-verb agreement is correct (non conosce is the correct form for third person singular masculine), and the word order is also appropriate.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The government has abolished the law." The subject "Il governo" (The government) agrees with the verb "ha abolito" (has abolished), and the object "la legge" (the law) is correctly introduced by the definite article "la".
0	The sentence "Ho spazzolato le scarpe" is written in Italian, not English. Therefore, it is grammatically incorrect as per the instructions of the task which requires checking the grammatical correctness of sentences written in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso has been living there for ten years." In Italian, adverbs of time such as "dieci anni" (ten years) generally come before the verb they modify when expressing duration. The form "abita," which comes from the verb "abitare" (to live), agrees with its subject "Tommaso" both in gender (male) and number (singular).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense and follows the standard subject-verb-object order in Italian. The subject "Riccardo" gave (dare) a book (un libro) to Sofia (a Sofia).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the simple past tense (Maria "ha" corso) of the Italian language, which translates to "Maria has run" in English. The rest of the sentence, "per ore," means "for hours." So, the full translation would be "Maria has run for hours."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense, indicating that Francesco drank a coffee. The sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure of Italian language where "Francesco" is the subject, "ha bevuto" is the verb, and "un caffè" is the object.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "Andrea has found an opera ticket" in English. The verb "ha trovato" agrees with the subject "Andrea" in number (singular) and gender (masculine). The direct object "un biglietto" also agrees with the article "l'" before "opera". Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject, and "sta compilando" (which means "is compiling") is its present continuous tense form for third person singular masculine. Therefore, it translates to "Edoardo is compiling."
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian and not English. A grammatically correct English version of this might be "They emit a scent." or "It gives off a smell.", depending on context.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian ("Aprire un nuovo negozio" translates to "Open a new store"), so I will evaluate it based on standard Italian grammar rules. In Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, but there is an exception when the adjective comes before the noun for emphasis or to convey a specific meaning. However, in this case, "nuovo" (new) does not seem to have any special emphasis, and its usual position would be after the noun "negozio." So, a more appropriate form of the given sentence could be "Aprire un negozio nuovo."
1	This sentence appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct. "Iniziare" means "to begin", "un'" is a feminine singular definite article used before words that start with a vowel or a stressed "h", and "attività" means "activity". So, "iniziare un'attività" can be translated as "to begin an activity", which makes sense in English too.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The door has closed" in English. The word order follows standard Italian syntax rules, with the subject ("la porta") coming before the verb ("si è chlussa"). Additionally, all words used in the sentence are correctly conjugated for tense and number, making it an acceptable sentence in Italian.
1	The sentence "Gabriele non ammette di essere preso in giro" is grammatically correct and acceptable. It's written in Italian and translates to "Gabriele does not admit to being made fun of" in English. Each word is correctly conjugated for the subject and tense used, making it grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense (ha restituito) and uses proper Italian grammar rules for word order and agreement between subject and verb. The sentence translates to "Paola returned the book" in English.
1	The sentence "Che cosa ha preso?" is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "What did he/she take?" in English. The word order and grammar rules for forming questions in Italian allow for this structure.
1	The sentence "Le scarpe si sono macchiate" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The shoes got stained." Each word follows proper conjugation rules for its respective tense and context.
1	The sentence "Le giornate si sono accorciate" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The days have shortened." In this sentence, "le" refers to "the," "giornate" is plural for "day(s)," "si" is a reflexive pronoun that agrees with the subject (in this case, "days"), "sono" is the third person plural form of the verb "to be" (which must agree with its subject as well), and "accorciate" is the past participle of the verb "accorciare" which means "to shorten."
1	The sentence "Qualcosa ha accorciato le giornate" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Something has shortened the days" in English. This type of sentence structure with subject-verb-object (SVO) order is common in Italian, so there's no issue with grammar or syntax here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "Qualcuno" (someone) agrees with the past tense verb form "ha accorciato" (has shortened), and the object "le giornate" (the days) correctly uses an article before it as required by Italian grammar rules.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is in Italian ("Aggrapparsi a un ramo" means "To cling to a branch" in English), not in English which was expected for the classification task.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The crews disembarked from the ships" in English. The subject-verb agreement is correct, with "Arenatesi" (crews) being plural and agreeing with "sono" (are). Also, the word order is correct and there are no spelling or grammar mistakes.
1	The sentence "La nebbia è svanita" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The fog has vanished." in English. Each word in the sentence exists in the Italian language, and it follows the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure of a simple declarative sentence.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "Alessandro" is followed by the reflexive pronoun "si", which agrees with the third person singular masculine form of the verb "piangere". The adverb "sempre" at the end of the sentence means "always". Therefore, the sentence translates to "Alessandro always cries himself."
1	The sentence "Riccardo si lagna sempre" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Riccardo always complains" in English. The word order, grammar, and spelling are all accurate for the given language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "With all her words, Maria nodded." The verb "annuire" (to nod) agrees with the subject "Maria". Also, the phrase "Alle sue parole" can be translated as "with her words", indicating that something was said by Maria before she nodded.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The water gushed out suddenly." The word order is correct, the verb form ("è sgorgata") agrees with its subject ("l'acqua"), and the preposition used before the time expression ("all'improvviso") is appropriate.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it violates syntactic rules in English language. The sentence appears to be in Italian, with "Andrea" as the subject, "ha" indicating a simple past tense verb form of "avere" (to have), and "sbadigliato" being the past participle of "sbadigliare" (to yawn). However, I am only asked to assess grammaticality in English; thus, since this is not an acceptable sentence in English, my response will be 0 for incorrect.
0	This sentence appears to be in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct English translation of the sentence would be "Riccardo is riding (a bike)."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "He took advantage of the experience." The verb "approfittare" agrees with its subject "egli" (he) in gender and number, which is not explicitly stated but understood from context. The preposition "di" governs the feminine singular noun "esperienza," so the agreement between them is also correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it means "Francesco's son sits in the first row at eight o'clock sharp." The verb "si siede" agrees with the subject "il figlio," and the adverbial expression "in prima fila alle 8 in punto" correctly indicates where and when the action takes place.
1	The sentence "Quando iniziò il concerto, il figlio di Leonardo sedeva in prima fila." is grammatically correct. It's an Italian sentence that means "When the concert started, Leo's son was sitting in the first row," where "iniziò" is past tense of "iniziare" (to start), "concerto" is concert, "figlio" is son, "di Leonardo" specifies whose son it is, "sedeva" is past tense of "sedere" (to sit) and "prima fila" means first row.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The wall gets moldy in a day." The verb "ammuffisce" agrees with its subject "il muro" in number (singular) and gender (masculine). The preposition "in" is correctly followed by the singular feminine noun "una giornata". All words are properly conjugated and inflected for their respective roles in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Paola is playing a piece by Bach." The verb "sta" is used here as an auxiliary verb to form the present continuous tense, similar to how we use "is" in English. The rest of the sentence is also correctly structured according to Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The choir sings very well." The verb "canta" agrees with its subject "il coro" (the choir) in number and gender, and the adverb "molto" correctly modifies the adjective "bene".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in Italian. "Riccardo" (Subject) aspires always at ("aspirava sempre") smoking ("il fumo del sigaro"). The verb form agrees with its subject's gender and number. All words are correctly conjugated for their tense and context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows the rules of Italian grammar. The subject "Andrea" aspires (aspira) to become (diventare) a doctor (medico).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Lorenzo did not cook." The subject-verb agreement is correct (third person singular), and there are no grammatical or spelling errors.
0	The sentence "La lettera scrive" is in Italian and it translates to "The letter writes." In English, only animate objects or people can write something, so the sentence is not grammatically correct. A better translation of "La lettera" would be "the letter," which requires a different verb for the action being performed on it (e.g., "I wrote a letter").
0	The sentence "Disturbo?" appears to be incomplete and contains an isolated Spanish word without any context or clear grammatical structure in English. A proper sentence requires both a subject and a predicate; however, there is no discernible subject or verb present in this instance.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject of the sentence and it's in third person singular present tense. The verb "sta compilando" means "is compiling", which agrees with the subject in number (singular) and tense (present). Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Riccardo hasn't been writing for a while." The verb form "scriv" followed by "e" is the third person singular indicative imperfect tense of the verb "scrivere," which means "to write." So, "non scrive" can be translated as "doesn't write" or "is not writing." Then, "più" indicates that something has stopped happening recently or for some time. Finally, "da un pezzo" literally translates to "from a piece (of time)," meaning "for a while" or "recently."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The driver stopped" in English. The subject-verb agreement is correct (il macchinista - third person singular; si è fermato - also third person singular), and the word order is appropriate for an affirmative statement with simple past tense.
0	The sentence "I negozianti hanno aumentato" is not grammatically correct because it's missing an object or complement that would complete its meaning. In Italian, "negozianti" (shopkeepers) requires either a direct or indirect object to clarify who or what is affected by their action of increasing something. Additionally, there seems to be a missing verb tense indicator in this phrase; therefore, it appears incomplete.
0	The given sentence "I bicchieri si sono rotti" appears to be in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct/acceptable sentence in English would have been something like "The glasses broke." or "The glasses have broken.", depending on context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense (Paola "ha" acceso) and it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian. The verb "accendere" means "to turn on or light", so the sentence translates to "Paola turned on the fire."
1	The sentence "Il soggiorno in Canada ha migliorato il suo inglese" is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it translates to "Staying in Canada improved his English." In Italian, "il soggiorno" means "the stay," "in Canada" specifies where that stay took place, "ha migliorato" indicates that something (his English) has been improved, and "il suo inglese" refers to "his English." All of the words are correctly conjugated and agree with each other in terms of number and gender.
1	The sentence "La lezione ha continuato" is in Italian and it translates to "The lesson continued" in English. In Italian, this sentence follows proper grammatical rules with regards to word order, tense agreement, subject-verb agreement, and use of appropriate endings for each word. Therefore, I would consider this sentence as being grammatically correct.
0	The given sentence "Saltare un ostacolo" appears to be in Italian and not English. Therefore, it cannot be evaluated for grammaticality in English. If we were to evaluate it as an Italian sentence, it would be grammatically correct since "saltare" means "to jump" and "un ostacolo" means "an obstacle". However, without context or additional information about who is doing the jumping, it's difficult to assess its overall coherence or appropriateness.
1	The sentence "Tutti si sono commossi." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Everyone got emotional" or "Everybody was moved" in English. This sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order of an affirmative statement in Italian. Additionally, all words used in the sentence are correctly inflected for number and tense.
1	The sentence "Si è macchiata la tovaglia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "She stained the tablecloth." Each word is spelled correctly, there is appropriate punctuation at the end of the sentence, and it follows standard Italian grammar rules for verb conjugation and subject-verb agreement.
0	This sentence is not in English, so it's difficult for me to determine its grammaticality based on English language rules. However, I can tell you that "Macchia il vino" appears to be in Italian and translates to "Stain the wine." In any case, since the prompt asks for an assessment of the sentence's grammaticality according to English, I must consider it ungrammatical.
1	The sentence "L'acqua è gelata in due ore" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The water will be frozen in two hours." In this sentence, "l'acqua" (water) is the subject; "è" (is) is an auxiliary verb that agrees with the subject in number and gender; "gelata" (frozen) is the past participle of the verb "gela," which agrees with the subject in gender; and "in due ore" (in two hours) is the time expression indicating when the action occurs.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "le tappe" (the stages) agrees with the plural verb form "hanno bruciato" (have burned). Additionally, the phrase "per un'ora" (for an hour) correctly indicates the duration of time during which something happened. Therefore, there don't seem to be any grammatical errors or awkward constructions that would make it unacceptable as a sentence in standard Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The glass breaks" in English. The word order follows standard Italian syntax rules, with the subject ("il vetro") followed by the verb ("si rompe"). Additionally, all words are properly inflected for number (singular) and tense (present indicative).
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "He/She verified the authenticity of the signature" in English. The verb "ha verificato" agrees with its subject (implied by the conjugation) in number and tense, and the object "l'autenticità della firma" follows standard Italian syntax rules for word order.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct but it depends on the language being used. The sentence "Riccardo lava la macchina" is in Italian and translates to "Riccardo washes the car". In Italian, this sentence follows the typical subject-verb-object word order and all words appear to be conjugated correctly. Therefore, assuming the context and intended meaning align with the given translation, I would classify this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense (Paola "ha" visto) and uses proper Italian grammar for combining verbs with subjects and objects. Specifically, "Paola ha visto" means "Paola has seen", "la partita" refers to "the match" or "the game", and "con gli amici" means "with her friends". So, overall, it translates to "Paola saw the game with her friends."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence means "Gabriele cut his sideburns" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Riccardo cut his chin with a razor." The verb "si è tagliato" agrees with the subject "Riccardo" in gender (masculine) and number (singular), and the object "il mento" correctly follows the definite article "il," which matches its masculine gender. Additionally, the preposition "con" followed by "il rasoio" accurately conveys the instrument used for cutting. Overall, all elements of the sentence follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The first part "Francesco si è calmato" can be translated as "Francesco has calmed down", while the second part "irrigidito" means "stiffened". Both parts of the sentence follow proper grammar rules for word order and verb conjugation in relation to their subjects.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence means "He broke the glass" in English.
0	This sentence is written in Italian, which means "Come to the party eating and drinking." The verb tense used for both verbs ("mangiate" and "bevute") does not match with the subject's implied time frame (which refers to an event happening now or imminently). To make it grammatically correct in Italian, you can use gerund forms of those verbs instead, such as "Venite alla festa mangiando e bevendo", meaning "Come to the party while eating and drinking".
1	The sentence "Il dibattito è continuato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The debate has continued." In Italian, subject-verb agreement rules require that the singular masculine form of the verb (in this case, "è," which means "has") be used with a singular masculine noun ("dibattito"). Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Il dibattito ha continuato" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated as "The debate continued" in English. Here's how we break it down: - "Il" (the) serves as the definite article for singular masculine nouns. - "dibattito" (debate) is the subject of the sentence. It is a singular masculine noun. - "ha continuato" (has continued) is the third person singular conjugation of the verb "continuare" (to continue). So, when combined, you have a complete thought that translates well between languages!
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha cancellato la scritta" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Riccardo erased the writing" or "Riccardo has erased the writing," depending on context. In either case, there's no grammatical issue with the original sentence.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct English version of the sentence could be "Leonardo is calling the phone," but the original sentence is still grammatically correct within its own language.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The phrase "Il livello si è alzato" translates to "The level has risen" in English. It follows the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure of an Italian sentence with proper agreement between subject and verb forms.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense (ha bruciato) and follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian. The sentence translates to "Francesco burned the cake" in English.
1	The sentence "Edoardo è pentito" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Edoardo is regretful" or "Edoardo repents" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "il bosco" (the forest) agrees with the verb "si è bruciato" (it burned), which is also correctly conjugated for the masculine singular subject in the passive voice. Additionally, the duration of three hours ("per tre ore") is expressed appropriately. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or unnatural expressions in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The laundry has dried for an hour." The verb "si è asciugata" agrees with its subject "la biancheria," which is feminine singular, so the past participle must also be feminine singular ("asciugata"). Additionally, the duration of time expression "per un'ora" (for an hour) indicates that the action occurred in the past and was completed, which makes sense given the perfect tense used here.
1	The given sentence "Il libro è sparito per tre giorni, poi è improvvisamente ricomparso sul mio tavolo" appears to be in Italian, not English. However, I will still analyze its grammaticality as a standalone statement. This sentence seems grammatically correct for native Italian speakers or those proficient in Italian language. It consists of two independent clauses connected by the conjunction "poi," which means "then." Both clauses express complete thoughts with appropriate verb forms based on subject-verb agreement rules. In conclusion, there are no apparent syntactic errors in the provided sentence, so it can be classified as grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si è ingrassato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Riccardo has gained weight" in English. In this sentence, "si" is a reflexive pronoun that agrees with the subject "Riccardo", while "è" is an auxiliary verb used for the compound past tense (passato prossimo) of the verb "ingrassare". Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or awkward constructions in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and translates to "Tommaso has gained a lot of weight since the last time I saw him." The verb "ingrassare" agrees with its subject "Tommaso," and the adverb "molto" correctly modifies the adjective "grasso." Additionally, the past tense of the verbs "essere" ("è") and "vedere" ("l'ho"), as well as the use of the definite article "la" before "ultima volta," indicate that this sentence is referring to something that happened in the past.
1	The sentence "Si è rotta la televisione in un'ora" is grammatically correct. This is an Italian sentence that translates to "The television broke in an hour." Both the grammar and syntax appear to be correct for the Italian language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "At exactly eight o'clock, the room emptied itself." The verb tense used (passato remoto) is appropriate for completed actions in the past. Also, the subject-verb agreement is correct, as well as the use of adverbs and prepositions.
1	The sentence "Il treno si è un po' fermato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The train stopped for a bit." In Italian, reflexive verbs such as "fermarsi" (to stop) require the use of the reflexive pronoun "si", which agrees with the subject in number and gender. Here, "treno" is masculine singular, so we have "si". The phrase "un po'" means "a little" or "for a bit". So the whole sentence can be translated as "The train has stopped for a bit".
1	The sentence "La camicia è sporca" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The shirt is dirty" in English. The word order and grammar rules follow standard Italian language conventions.
0	The sentence contains an error in the subject-verb agreement. In Italian, the verb form must agree with the number (singular or plural) of its subject. Here, "Ho" (I have) does not match with the plural noun "libro" (book). It should be changed to "Notavo un libro caduto." for it to be grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Alessandro conosce le strade" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence translates to "Alessandro knows the streets" in English, which follows proper grammar rules for subject-verb agreement and noun gender (le strade = the feminine plural noun "streets").
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The verb "approfitta" means "takes advantage of" in English, but it's unclear what the subject or object of the sentence might be. Additionally, without context, it's difficult to determine who "Maria" is in relation to the action. Therefore, I cannot definitively say that this sentence is grammatically correct or acceptable in English.
0	This sentence appears to be in Italian, with an Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order similar to English ("Chi" being "who", "Leonardo" being the subject name, and "ama" meaning "loves"). However, it seems that there's something missing or misplaced here, as the question structure requires an interrogative pronoun at the beginning followed by a verb and its subject; for example, "Chi ama Leonardo?" would mean "Who loves Leonardo?" Thus, the given sentence needs rephrasing to be grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Francesco è il capo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Francesco is the boss" in English. Both the subject-verb agreement (Francesco is masculine singular; esse is used as the verb for third person singular) and article-noun agreement ("il" agrees with "capo") are consistent throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence "Trenta chili sono pesati da Alessandro" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Thirty kilograms were weighed by Alessandro" in English. In this sentence, "trenta chili" (thirty kilograms) is the subject, "sono" (are) is the auxiliary verb, and "pesati" (weighed) is the past participle form of the verb "pesare". Therefore, it follows the standard SVO structure used in Italian sentences.
1	The sentence "Mio nonno ha venduto il suo podere" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "My grandfather sold his farm" in English. All words are correctly spelled, and they follow proper grammar rules for word order and verb conjugation in Italian.
1	The sentence "Due lingue sono parlate da tutti i miei studenti" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Two languages are spoken by all of my students." In Italian, due is the number two, lingue means languages, sono is the third person plural form of the verb essere (to be), which agrees with the subject due lingue, da is the preposition meaning spoken by, tutti is the masculine singular definite article that becomes tutti when used as an adjective or pronoun, and mi means my. So, it's grammatically acceptable.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The English translation of this sentence would be "Otto hours a day are studied by Tommaso," which is grammatically incorrect because the subject-verb agreement is wrong (the plural form "are" does not match with the singular subject "otto"). In addition, there seems to be some confusion about who or what is doing the studying - it's unclear whether Tommaso is studying otto hours a day, or otto hours a day are being studied for some other reason. A clearer sentence might be "Tommaso studies for eight hours a day."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "trivella" agrees with its subject "Alessandro," which is second person singular. Additionally, the object of the sentence "questa cosa" is correctly placed after the verb as required by Italian grammar.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Tommaso returns from Rome." The verb "torna" agrees with the subject "Tommaso" in number (singular) and gender (male), and the preposition "da" followed by the city "Roma" indicates where Tommaso is returning from.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it means "Francesco grinds coffee in an old grinder." The verb "macina" agrees with the subject "Francesco," and both "caffè" and "macinino" are correctly declined according to their roles in the sentence (direct object and oblique noun phrase, respectively).
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it seems to follow the standard subject-verb-object word order of SVO (Tommaso, rubò, il portafoglio). However, without additional context, I can only judge the grammaticality of the sentence itself and not its appropriateness or truthfulness in a particular situation.
0	The given sentence "Dove Riccardo mise la cassa nel mobile?" appears to be in Italian, not English. Therefore, it's impossible for me to accurately assess its grammaticality as an English sentence. However, I can say that, as an Italian sentence, there seems to be nothing particularly wrong with it at first glance. It could roughly translate to "Where did Riccardo put the case in the cabinet?" in English, but without more context, it's hard to make a definitive judgement on its grammaticality in either language.
1	The sentence "Lo scoglio affiora" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The reef emerges" or "The rock appears above water surface" in English. Here's why it's correct: - "Lo scoglio" (pronounced as loh skohl-yoh) means "the reef" or "the rock." In Italian, when using an adjective that describes a masculine singular noun starting with a stressed "z" or "s" sound, you use "lo" instead of "il," which would be used for other masculine singular nouns.    - "Affiora" (pronounced as ahf-fyorah) is the third person present indicative form of the verb "affiorare," meaning "to emerge" or "to appear at the surface." This tense agrees with the subject "scoglio."     Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it might not be understood by English speakers because it's in Italian. In English grammar, the sentence is correct as well with the subject-verb agreement (Andrea is behaving).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence means "Leonardo takes away the pen" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Lorenzo takes the newspaper out of the safe." The verb "toglie" agrees with the subject "Lorenzo" in number (singular) and gender (masculine). The prepositional phrase "dalla cassaforte" correctly uses the singular feminine form of the definite article ("la") before "cassaforte". Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Alessandro legge un libro a letto" seems to be written in Italian, not English. A literal translation of this sentence into English would be "Alessandro reads a book in bed." Since the original sentence is grammatically correct for its respective language (Italian), I am assuming that you want me to assess its grammaticality in English instead. In English, as mentioned earlier, it translates to "Alessandro reads a book in bed," which follows proper English syntax rules; however, without context or further information about specific requirements regarding the assessment, I cannot confirm if there's any reason why the direct translation may also need to be evaluated.
0	The word "the" before "tazzina" is not needed and it's also misspelled as "the" instead of "il". A grammatically correct version would be: "Riccardo beve il caffè in una tazzina di porcellana." (Riccardo drinks coffee from a cup made of china).
0	The given sentence "Dove Andrea ha preso una sigaretta?" appears to be in Italian, not English. Therefore, it's difficult for me to evaluate its grammaticality as an English sentence. However, even if we consider this sentence within the context of Italian language, there seems to be a missing question mark at the end which would make it a complete question (a requirement for a grammatically acceptable sentence). In standard written Italian, questions typically end with a question mark. So, the corrected version could be "Dove Andrea ha preso una sigaretta?" or "Dove ha preso Andrea una sigaretta?" depending on what exactly one wants to ask.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct version in English would be "Tommaso drew the gun in the bar."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Riccardo eats the rice" in English. The word order and grammar rules of Italian allow for this structure.
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. The phrase "Tommaso vi sostiene la lastra" is grammatically correct in Italian and translates to "Tommaso supports the sheet (or tile) for you" in English. However, since the original question asks for grammatical evaluation of an English sentence, I have labeled it as incorrect.
1	The sentence "Edoardo prese il libro di storia dalla libreria" is grammatically correct. This is an Italian sentence that translates to "Edoardo took the history book from the library." Each word in the sentence follows grammatical rules for Italian language, such as proper verb conjugations (e.g., "prese"), definite articles ("il", "la") used with nouns depending on their gender, and appropriate word order. Therefore, it's a grammatically acceptable sentence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Leonardo takes the book from the room of the library". The verb "prende" agrees with the subject "Leonardo", and the preposition "dalla" followed by "saladella biblioteca" correctly indicates that Leonardo is taking the book from a specific place (the library room).
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct, but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence translates to "Gabriele puts the boxes on the loading platform" in English. In Italian, the verb conjugation "mette" agrees with the subject "Gabriele," and the word order follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Dove hai messo le foto di Francesco?" is grammatically correct. It's an Italian sentence that translates to "Where did you put Francesco's photos?" in English. All the words used are correctly spelled and conjugated according to their grammatical function in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso takes money out of the drawer" in English. The subject of the sentence is "Tommaso", followed by the verb "toglie" (third person singular form of "togliere"), which agrees with the gender and number of the subject. Then we have "i soldi" (the money) as direct object, and finally "dal cassetto" (out of the drawer), where "dal" indicates movement from inside something.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The key is in the hole." The words are used correctly and they agree with each other in terms of number, gender, and tense as required by Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "From the garden to the street, Lorenzo has planted the flowers." The verb "piantare" agrees with the subject "Lorenzo" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and it is correctly conjugated in the passato prossimo tense. The phrase "dal giardino alla strada" is a correct way to indicate movement from one place to another. All words are properly declined and there are no missing or extra components in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Francesco has thrown the ball from the balcony to the garden." The verb "ha lanciato" indicates that the action happened in the past. The subject "Francesco" is followed by the verbe "ha lanciato", then comes the direct object "il pallone" (the ball), and finally we have two prepositional phrases indicating where the action started ("dal balcone" - from the balcony) and where it ended ("al giardino" - to the garden).
0	In Italian, it's important to follow the agreement between the subject and verb as well as maintain the logical order of elements in a sentence for proper understanding. The given sentence "Dal giardino Leonardo ha piantato fiori al garage" seems to have an issue with word order. A more appropriate way to phrase this idea would be "Leonardo ha piantato fiori al garage dal giardino." However, even though I fixed the structure, there might still be some context missing because typically you wouldn't say that someone planted flowers from one place (the garden) to another (garage).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "carica" (which means "loads") agrees with its subject "Edoardo", and both direct object ("le casse" meaning "the crates") and indirect object ("sulla nave" meaning "onto the ship") are correctly placed after the verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The ladder leans against the wall." The word order, verb conjugation, and agreement between words all follow the rules of standard Italian grammar.
1	The sentence "I rivoltosi incarcerarono Gabriele nelle segrete della fortezza" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The rebels imprisoned Gabriele in the dungeon of the fortress". Each word follows proper conjugation rules based on tense, subject-verb agreement, and grammatical gender where appropriate. Therefore, it's an acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Francesco locked Juliet in the room." The verb "chiuse" agrees with its subject "Francesco" (both singular masculine), and matches the past tense required by the adverb "Giulia...dentro la stanza," which sets up the scene as something that has already happened.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct English version of the sentence could be "Gabriele closed the money." However, I am unsure what you meant by "the money" because typically we do not talk about closing money in English. If you intended to say something else (e.g., that Gabriele put money in his wallet), please let me know!
0	The sentence "Gabriele dette appoggio al libro" appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct version of the sentence in English would be "Gabriele offered support to the book," but I assume you want me to evaluate it as an Italian sentence, for which my knowledge is limited.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Alessandro supports the spread of the book" in English. The verb "dette" (which seems to have been intended as "da") agrees with the subject "Alessandro", and the object "appoggio" correctly takes the definite article "alla".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The English translation of this sentence would be "Lorenzo loaded the truck," which is also grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Questo latte deterge le impurità dal volto." is in Italian and it means "This milk cleans impurities from the face" in English. Since I am not evaluating the grammar of an English sentence, but rather its translation in Italian, I will consider it as grammatically correct given that there are no apparent errors based on my knowledge cutoff year of 2021.
0	The sentence "Riccardo stipò l'armadio con i vestiti." is written in Italian, not English. Therefore, it is grammatically incorrect for an English language context. In English, a possible translation could be "Riccardo stuffed the wardrobe with clothes.", which would be grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "La fotografia di Giulia e quella di Lorenzo stanno attaccate" is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "Giulia's photograph and Lorenzo's one are stuck together." In English, you might say "Giulia's and Lorenzo's photographs are stuck together," but that wording does not translate directly into idiomatic Italian. Instead, each noun has its own definite article (la) plus adjective (fotografia), followed by the plural form of the verb "to be" (stanno). Additionally, it uses the reflexive past participle "attaccate", which agrees with both subjects in gender and number.
1	The sentence "Riccardo allontanò Paola e la finestra l'una dall'altra." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo moved Paola and the window away from each other". Each word is correctly spelled, and it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of an Italian sentence. Additionally, the reflexive pronoun "l'una" agrees with its plural antecedents ("Paola e la finestra") and appears before the preposition "dall'altra", as required by Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Francesco avvolge la statua in una tela di lino" appears to be grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of an Italian sentence with a subject ("Francesco"), verb ("avvolge", meaning "wraps"), indirect object ("la statua", meaning "the statue") and prepositional phrase ("in una tela di lino," meaning "in a linen cloth"). All words appear to be correctly spelled and conjugated for their intended use in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows the rules of Italian grammar with a clear subject ("Alessandro"), verb ("accompagna", meaning "accompanies"), and object ("Sofia"). The destination ("al cinema", meaning "to the cinema") is also clearly indicated with proper prepositions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Andrea accompanied Paola to school" in English. The verb "accompagnò" agrees with its subject "Andrea" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the preposition "a" followed by "scuola" correctly indicates the destination of an action.
1	The sentence "I libri non stanno nell'armadio" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The books do not go in the closet", which follows proper Italian syntax and grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "Andrea crossed the least dangerous part of the river" in English. The word order is correct, the verb conjugation matches the subject, and there are no apparent grammatical errors.
0	The sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct version of the sentence in English would be "I intend to dress as a bride." However, since the original sentence was given in Italian, I am assuming that the goal was to evaluate it based on Italian grammar rules instead of English ones. In Italian, the subject pronoun (e.g., io, tu, lui) is often omitted because the verb form itself indicates the subject. Therefore, the corrected sentence in Italian should be "Ho l'intenzione di vestirmi da sposa," which means "I intend to dress as a bride" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense (mangiava) and follows the typical Subject-Verb-Object structure of Italian sentences. The subject "Francesco" is doing the action "mangiava" (ate) to the object "il pane" (the bread) with "soddisfazione" (satisfaction).
1	The sentence "Quella mattina pioveva a dirotto" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It was raining hard that morning." In this sentence, "quella" refers to "that" or "the", "mattina" means "morning", "pioveva" is the imperfect form of "piovere" which means "to rain", and "a dirotto" is an adverbial expression meaning "violently". Therefore, it's a grammatically acceptable sentence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Alessandro drinks wine" in English. In Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, which is why "vino", the noun, comes before "bevo", the verb that describes what Alessandro does with the wine (drinks it).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense, indicating that two actions occurred sequentially. The first action was "Francesco ha telefonato" (Francesco made a call), and the second action was "Maria è venuta" (Maria came). Both sentences are independent clauses and are correctly separated by "e" (and).
1	The sentence "Quel libro è stato dato a Paola da Gabriele" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "That book was given to Paola by Gabriele." In Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify (quel libro), and past participle verbs agree with the gender and number of the direct object when there's a change in possession (dato). Therefore, it follows proper Italian grammar rules, so I would consider this as an acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Paola receives that book from Riccardo." The verb "ricevere" agrees with its subject "Paola," and the objects "quel libro" (that book) and "da Riccardo" (from Riccardo) are correctly placed and formed.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the present tense, first person singular of the Italian language, and it means "Andrea eats an octopus". The verb "mangia" agrees with the subject "Andrea", and "un polpo" (an octopus) is correctly used as the direct object of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Tommaso mangia questo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Tommaso eats this" in English. Each word in the sentence is correctly spelled and properly used according to Italian grammar rules. Additionally, the verb "mangia" agrees with its subject "Tommaso" in terms of number (singular) and person (third). Therefore, I would say that it's a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Sofia loves her" or "Sofia loves him" in English (depending on the gender of the person being referred to with "lo"). The structure of the sentence follows standard subject-verb-object order in Italian.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The word "l'artrosi" means "osteoarthritis," "ha" is an auxiliary verb used for the past tense of "to have," and "paralizzato" is the past participle form of "to paralyze." Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "Osteoarthritis has paralyzed the bones" which seems grammatically accurate given the context.
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. The English translation would be "Maria wants to eat it." In English, subject pronouns (he, she, Maria) generally come before the verb, whereas in this Italian sentence, the object pronoun ("lo") comes before the verb. Therefore, without context indicating that you're using another language, I must consider this an incorrect sentence for an English assignment or conversation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in Italian language where "Lorenzo" is the subject, "ammira" is the verb, and "Alice" is the object of the sentence.
0	The sentence "Riccardo la ammira" appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct sentence in English would be something like "Riccardo admires her."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Edoardo aims for the presidency". The verb "mira" agrees with the subject "Edoardo", and "alla presidenza" is correctly used as the goal of his aiming.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It's on the bed that Maria jumps." The verb "è" (is) agrees with its subject "esso/essa/essi/esse," which is not explicitly mentioned but understood from context. The preposition "che" introduces a subordinate clause indicating where an action takes place.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "Edoardo" is followed by the conjugated verb "vuole" (which means "wants") and the direct object "il caffè" (which means "the coffee"). Before that, there's an adverb "subito", which means "immediately". So, the whole sentence means "It's immediately that Edoardo wants the coffee."
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in Standard Italian. The subject of the sentence "al successo" (to success) does not agree with the verb form "ciò" (it). Additionally, there seems to be a missing direct object for the verb "tenere" (to hold), which requires an object. A possible correction could be "È il successo a cui Tommaso aspira" (It's success that Tommaso aspires to).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "It is the presidency that Leo aims for" or "Leo is aiming for the presidency". The verb "mirare" (to aim) agrees with the subject "Leonardo", and "alla presidenza" (for the presidency) is correctly constructed as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian language where "Riccardo" is the subject, "adora" is the verb, and "il cinema" is the object of the sentence. The word order is also correct as it maintains the natural flow of the Italian language. Moreover, all words used in the sentence are correctly spelled, making it a grammatical and acceptable sentence in Italian.
1	The sentence "È il cinema che Francesco adora." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "It's the cinema that Francesco adores" in English. The verb "è" (third person singular of "essere", meaning "to be") agrees with its subject "il cinema". Also, "che Francesco adora" is correctly formed as a relative clause modifying "cinema".
1	The sentence "È il cinema e non la musica che Alessandro adora." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means that Alessandro loves the cinema, not music. The sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules with regards to word order, verb agreement, and gender concordance.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian rather than English. The phrase "I denti di Emma battono dal freddo" translates to "Emma's teeth chatter from the cold" in English. However, since you asked for grammatical classification of an English sentence, I had to mark it as incorrect.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The sentence "Alessandro le adora che hanno gambe lunghe le donne" is grammatically incorrect in English. A possible correct translation of this sentence into English could be "Alessandro loves that women have long legs." However, without more context it's difficult to provide an accurate and nuanced translation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Andrea really loves Emma's friends" in English. The word order, verb conjugation, and grammatical agreement between words are all correct according to Italian language rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian, not English, but it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of many Indo-European languages. The subject "Gabriele" (a name) agrees with the verb "mangia" (meaning eats), indicating that the speaker is referring to one person who is eating something. In turn, "un gelato" (one ice cream) serves as the object being eaten by the subject. Overall, while the language used here may be unfamiliar to some readers, its grammar remains sound.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Riccardo promises Riccardo that he will come." The verb form "promette" agrees with its subject "Riccardo," while "verrà" also agrees with its implied subject (the second instance of "Riccardo"). Each pronoun matches its corresponding antecedent, which makes the sentence clear and understandable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The octopus is eaten by Sophia" in English. The subject of the sentence is "il polpo" (the octopus), which is in singular masculine form. The verb "è" agrees with it in number and gender. The preposition "da" introduces the agent of the passive voice, which is "Sofia".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Tolerance does not exclude its duties." Each word is correctly used and inflected according to standard Italian grammar rules. The verb "escludere" (to exclude) has been replaced by "esulare," which better fits the meaning of the sentence; that is, tolerance doesn't keep one from fulfilling their responsibilities or duties.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "Riccardo" is clearly indicated, followed by "ci", which here serves as an indirect object pronoun referring to the location where the action (coming) will occur. Finally, "viene da Roma" indicates that Riccardo comes from Rome. Therefore, without more context about what you consider acceptable or not, I would say it's grammatically correct based on standard Italian syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the present tense (third person singular) and follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object word order in Italian. The subject "Andrea" is thinking about or focusing on the object "Paola".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in Italian and it means "Sofia accompanies Maria to China". The verb "accompagnare" agrees with its subject "Sofia", and both nouns "Maria" and "Cina" are correctly declined according to their respective genders (feminine singular for "Maria" and feminine plural for "Cina").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, and it means "Emma and the movie saw each other" or more naturally, "Emma and the movie have both been seen (by someone)." The verb "si sono visti" is a reflexive form that indicates reciprocal action.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Alessandro admires Paola's house." The verb "ammira" agrees with the subject "Alessandro" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the relative pronoun "che" introduces a dependent clause that modifies "la casa". The endings of "è" and "Paola" also agree in number and gender.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The word "involontariamente" means "unintentionally," "assorbe" is the third-person singular form of the verb "assorbire," which means "to absorb," and "Beatrice" and "Francesco" are both proper nouns that refer to people. Therefore, the sentence can be interpreted as "Beatrice unintentionally absorbs Francesco." Without more context, it's difficult to say for sure what exactly is happening or who these people are, but the grammar itself seems correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo distributes bricks" in English. The verb "distribuire" agrees with its subject "Lorenzo," which is singular and masculine, and the direct object "mattoni" (bricks) is in plural form and matches the gender of the indirect object pronoun "le."
0	The given sentence "Che Riccardo dipinga è bello." seems to be ungrammatical or incomplete in standard Italian. It appears that there might be some words missing or misplaced which makes it difficult for native speakers to understand its intended meaning clearly. A more comprehensible version of the sentence could be something like "Riccardo che dipinge è bello" (the Riccardo who paints is handsome) but without additional context, I cannot determine whether this would be an accurate interpretation either.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's written in Italian, not English. The word "Sofia" is a name of a person, "passeggia" is the third-person singular present indicative form of the verb "passeggiare", which means "to take a walk", and "per" means "through". So, the whole sentence translates to "Sophia walks through Venice."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria collects pebbles" in English. The subject of the sentence, "Maria," is in the singular feminine form and agrees with the verb "raccoglie," which is also conjugated in the third person singular (present tense) for feminine subjects. Additionally, the object of the sentence, "sassolini," is plural and matches the meaning conveyed by the sentence.
0	The sentence "Giulia legge" is not grammatically correct in English. It seems that it might be written in another language, possibly Italian (where "legge" means "reads"). However, as an English-language helper, I must assess sentences based on their grammaticality in English. In English, we would say "Giulia reads."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice handles with skill" or more idiomatically "Beatrice is skilled at handling (something)". The word "schermisce" is a third-person singular conjugation of the verb "schermire", which can mean "to handle", "to fence", or "to shield". In this context, it's likely being used metaphorically to indicate expertise or dexterity in dealing with something.
0	The word "traveste" does not exist in English language. It seems that it might be derived from the Portuguese verb "travestir", which means "to disguise". In any case, without context there's no way of knowing for sure what was intended by using this word. However, assuming you meant "transports" or something similar, the sentence would still be ungrammatical because it lacks an article before "Alice". A possible correction could be "Maria transports Alice."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It consists of two simple sentences in the present tense connected by "umilia" (which can function as both a linking verb meaning "humiliates" and an object). The first noun phrase "Emma" acts as the subject of the sentence, while "Edoardo" serves as its direct object. Both names seem to follow Italian grammar rules for capitalization. In addition, there are no apparent spelling or punctuation errors. However, please note that I am only evaluating the syntax and morphology of this particular sentence; semantic interpretation might require additional context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The lightning struck on Andrea's head." in English. The word order and grammar rules follow standard Italian language conventions.
0	The given sentence "Fa neve" seems to be incomplete or written in an unknown language. If it's supposed to be English, it contains errors that make it ungrammatical and difficult to understand. A possible correction could be "The snow falls," assuming that was the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "Alessandro dormicchia nell'inazione più totale" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of the structure: * Alessandro - Proper noun (name of a person) * dormicchia - Third-person singular present tense conjugation of the verb "dormire," which means "to sleep." This form implies that the subject is doing so lazily or half-asleep. * nell'inazione - A prepositional phrase meaning "in inaction" or "in idleness." It consists of the preposition "nel(l)" followed by the noun "inazione" with an article attached ("il" becomes "l" before vowels). * più totale - An adverbial expression formed by combining the comparative degree "più" (more) and the superlative form of the adjective "totale" (total), thus implying complete idleness or inactivity. The overall meaning can be translated as "Alessandro sleeps through the most absolute inaction." However, it's worth noting that idioms and colloquialisms may not translate directly between languages, but the grammatical construction seems valid.
1	The sentence "La maionese non ha preso bene" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. This phrase translates to "The mayonnaise didn't take well" or "The mayonnaise hasn't thickened" in English. All of the words seem to follow proper conjugations for their respective tenses, and there do not appear to be any obvious grammatical errors.
1	The sentence "Maria sorride a Giulia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Maria smiles at Julia." In Italian, subject pronouns (like "Maria") are often omitted because the verb form itself indicates the subject. Here, "sorride" is the third-person singular form of the verb "smiling," which matches the gender and number of the subject "Maria." Additionally, prepositions such as "a" indicate relationships between words or phrases in a sentence; here it shows that Maria's action is directed towards Giulia. Thus, everything about this sentence checks out, making it grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Quel vestito non va ad Alice" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "That dress does not fit Alice". The word order is subject-verb-indirect object (Alice) which follows standard Italian syntax. All words are correctly spelled and agree with each other in gender and number as required by Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Il capitale dell'azienda ammonta a molti miliardi." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The company's capital amounts to many billions," which follows proper syntax rules of word order and agreement between subject and verb.
1	The sentence "Una stella splende nel cielo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A star shines in the sky." Each word follows proper grammar rules for Italian language including agreement of gender (una - feminine) and number (stella - singular), and the verb splende agrees with its subject una stella.
1	The sentence "Una stella brilla nel cielo" is in Italian and it translates to "A star shines in the sky". It is grammatically correct in Italian as each word agrees with others in terms of number (singular) and gender (feminine). Also, the sentence structure follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A star twinkles in the sky." The word order is correct, as well as the verb conjugation and agreement between subject ("una stella") and verb ("scintilla"). All words are correctly spelled and there's no missing or extra punctuation marks.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Maria's dress sparkles with a stunning diamond." The grammar structure, verb conjugation, and word usage are all appropriate for the language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows proper Italian syntax rules with a subject ("Beatrice") and predicate ("arde dalla passione"). The verb "ardere" agrees with its singular feminine subject in number and gender. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "dalla passione" provides more context about what Beatrice is feeling. Overall, it's a well-structured and meaningful Italian sentence.
1	The sentence "Paola luccicava dall'emozione" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated to "Paola was sparkling with emotion" in English. The subject-verb agreement is consistent (Paola - third person singular; luccicava - also third person singular), and the phrase "dall'emozione" correctly uses the preposition "da" for expressing "with" an emotional state. Therefore, I would classify it as grammatically correct.
0	The given sentence "Quell'idea si fa chiara nel suo animo." appears to be in Italian rather than English. Therefore, I am unable to determine its grammaticality based on standard English language rules.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The verb "ritorna" should agree with its subject "Gabriele" in number (singular), but it seems that the ending "-vi" was added after "Gabriele," which makes the sentence ungrammatical. A correct version could be "Gabriele torna."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's written in Italian, not English. The translation of "Riccardo giunge in casa" in English would be "Riccardo arrives home". Since you didn't ask for a translation, I assume you wanted to know if the sentence is grammatically correct in its original language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it means "The stairs go down to the cellar." The verb "scendere" agrees with the subject "la scala" (the stairs) in number and tense. The preposition "in" followed by "cantina" correctly indicates where the action of going down happens.
1	The sentence "Il sentiero ci arriva" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The path gets to us" or "The path reaches us". In Italian, subject pronouns (like "ci", meaning "us") can often be omitted because the verb form itself already indicates the subject. Here, "arriva" is an third-person singular verb that agrees with the implied subject "il sentiero" (the path).
1	The given sentence "La Maggioranza patteggia con l'Opposizione" appears to be in Italian and it seems grammatically correct. In English, it translates to "The majority (of something) bargains with the Opposition." Each word follows standard conjugation rules for their respective parts of speech. Therefore, I would classify this as grammatically acceptable.
0	The given sentence "Emma lotta su questo punto" seems to be in Italian, not English. In Italian, "lotta" means "fights", so it doesn't make sense in this context. Moreover, there is no subject-verb agreement as well. A possible correct version could be "Emma si occupa di questo punto" which translates to "Emma deals with this point".
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "tagliare" (to cut) agrees with its subject "Riccardo," and "a fette" (in slices) correctly modifies the direct object "il pane" (the bread). All words are properly conjugated for their intended use.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence "Riccardo gli vide il volto" translates to "Riccardo saw his face" in English. In English, the sentence would be grammatically correct as well.
1	The sentence "Il sarto ha confezionato un vestito di lino" is grammatically correct. It's an Italian sentence that translates to "The tailor has made a linen suit." In Italian, word order can be flexible, making it different from English in some cases. This sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules for subject-verb agreement and proper noun gender (il = masculine singular definite article). All words used are also correctly spelled and appropriate in context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "Tommaso" is in singular masculine form (third person) which matches with the verb "ha edificato", that is also in third person singular form. Moreover, "una palazzina" agrees in gender and number with the adjective "centrale". Finally, "nel centro di Roma" correctly indicates where the action of building took place.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Andrea is cruel to Alice." The verb "è" agrees with the subject "Andrea," and the adjective "brutale" agrees with the object "Alice" in gender (both feminine) and number (singular).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Japan colonized Manchuria." The verb "colonizzò" agrees with its subject "Il Giappone" (Japan) in number and tense, and the object "la Manciuria" (Manchuria) is correctly preceded by the definite article "la" which matches the gender of the noun.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "aveva ammassato" (had piled up) in number and tense, and the direct object "pacchetti" (packages) follows correctly after its verb. Additionally, the prepositional phrase "alla base della libreria" (at the bottom of the library) provides clear information about where the action took place. Therefore, there don't seem to be any grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make this sentence unacceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Leonardo had piled up against the wall." The verb "aveva ammassato" is in past tense which agrees with the subject "Leonardo". The preposition "contro" followed by "il muro" (the wall) correctly indicates where Leo had piled something up. Therefore, there is no grammatical issue found here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject, "ci" is an indirect object pronoun that refers back to "a noi" (to us), and "aveva ammassato pacchetti" is the verb phrase where "aveva" is the auxiliary verb used with passato prossimo tense which describes an action completed in the past, and "ammassato" means "had piled up", while "pacchetti" is the direct object meaning "packets". So, the whole sentence can be translated as "Lorenzo had piled packets up for us."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "The miser accumulates wealth." The grammar structure of the sentence follows standard Italian language rules with subject-verb agreement and proper use of tense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Leonardo is important to us." The subject-verb agreement is correct (Leonardo - singular, è - third person singular), and the ending of 'importante' agrees with the plural noun 'noi'.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows all of the rules for word order, verb conjugation, and agreement that would be expected in standard Italian. "Il Sergente" (The Sergeant) is the subject, "distribuisce" (distributes) is the verb in third person singular form, agreeing with the subject, and "i soldati" (the soldiers) is the direct object.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct, but it's written in Italian, not English. The English translation of this sentence would be "Sofia divided the work into two distinct parts."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows the rules of Italian grammar. The subject "Paola" is followed by the indirect object pronoun "gli", indicating that she touched someone else (not herself). Then we have the verb "carezzò" in past tense, which means "touched". Finally, there's the direct object "il volto", meaning "the face". So, the sentence translates to "Paola touched his face" in English.
1	The sentence "Questa situazione gli complica la vita." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "This situation complicates his life" in English. It follows proper subject-verb agreement and uses appropriate word order for an affirmative statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows the rules of Italian grammar. The subject "Maria" is followed by the verb "afferrò" (past tense of "afferrare", meaning "to grab") and the direct object "la mano di Lorenzo" (Lorenzo's hand).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "This medicine clots the blood." The verb "coagula" agrees with its subject "questa medicina," and the object "il sangue" follows the standard rules of Italian grammar.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct but it depends on the language being used. The sentence "Riccardo forgia l'acciaio" is in Italian and can be translated as "Riccardo forges steel". In Italian, this sentence follows proper word order and verb conjugation rules, making it grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's written in Italian, not English. The translation of "Sofia cooks lemon chicken" in Italian is "Sofia cuoce il pollo al limone". However, without referring to its meaning in another language, the sentence structure and grammar rules followed are correct for an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) language.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Women give birth to children" in English. The verb "partorire", which means "to give birth," agrees with its plural subject "le donne." Therefore, there are no apparent grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it means "Paola turns sugar into candies". The verb "converte" agrees with the subject "Paola", and both the direct object "lo zucchero" (the sugar) and the indirect object "le caramelle" (the candies) are correctly declined according to their gender and number.
1	The sentence "Il governo converte gli oppositori in criminali." is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it translates to "The government turns opponents into criminals" in English. The verb "converte" agrees with its subject "il governo", and "gli oppositori" (the opponents) matches with the preposition "in" followed by "criminali" (criminals).
0	This sentence mixes two languages, French and Italian, which makes it grammatically incorrect in both languages. The French subject "Alice" does not agree with the past participle "travestì", which is Italian. In French, the past participle should be "travesti". Additionally, in Italian, the subject-verb agreement is also violated as "Alice" is feminine singular while "travestì" is masculine singular.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject, "ne" is a pronoun that refers back to something previously mentioned, "liberò" is the verb meaning "freed", and "il cane" is the object of the sentence. The sentence could be translated as "Riccardo freed the dog."
1	The sentence "Lo Stato accorda troppa fiducia all'amministrazione pubblica." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The State places too much trust in public administration" and follows proper subject-verb-object word order with correct agreement between subjects and verbs as well as appropriate use of idiomatic expressions.
1	The sentence "Tommaso attribuì la decisione di andare in Cina a Leonardo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated into English as "Tommaso attributed the decision to go to China to Leonardo", where each word has its corresponding form according to grammatical rules. In particular, "attribuì" agrees with the subject "Tommaso" in person and number, while "decisione," "andare," and "Cina" are all correctly declined depending on their role in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Leonardo addebitava il suo insuccesso alla decisione del padre di andare in Francia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo attributed his failure to his father's decision to go to France." Each word is correctly spelled, and the grammar rules of agreement between words (such as gender and number) are followed correctly. Therefore, I would rate it as acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Francesco leaves his wife on the road." The verb "abbandona" agrees with its subject "Francesco," and both "moglie" (wife) and "strada" (road) are correctly declined according to their gender and number.
1	The sentence "I ladri rubano le auto ai legittimi proprietari" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Thieves steal cars from their legitimate owners". Each word follows proper conjugation rules for its respective tense and subject-verb agreement within the context of the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense and follows proper Italian grammar rules for verb conjugations and word order. The subject "Maria" is followed by the verb "spalmò" (third-person singular past tense of "spalmare", meaning "to spread"), and the direct object "il pane" and instrument "coltello".
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The phrase "Riccardo mise il tavolo di cappello" does not follow proper English grammar rules. A more accurate translation of this phrase from Italian to English would be "Riccardo put the table hat." However, even with the correct words, the resulting English sentence still seems nonsensical due to cultural differences (tables do not wear hats). It's essential that sentences make sense both linguistically and culturally for them to be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The enemy aviation bombed napalm on the city" in English. The word order is appropriate for an Italian sentence, with the subject (l'aviazione nemica) coming first, followed by the verb (bombardò), and finally the object (napalm sulla città). All of the words appear to be spelled correctly as well.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The phrase "Andrea imbeve il pane di vino" translates to "Andrew gulps the wine bread" in English. However, even if we were to evaluate it as an Italian sentence, it would still be grammatically incorrect because "imbeve" is not a transitive verb that takes a direct object such as "il pane." A more appropriate way to say "Andrew eats the bread made of wine" (which seems to be the intended meaning) in Italian would be "Andrea mangia il pane al vino."
0	This sentence is written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct English version of this sentence could be "Rosa red was upholstering the cushions." or "The red rose was upholstering the cushions," depending on context.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo dissemina aneddoti divertenti nei suoi racconti" is in Italian and it means "Lorenzo spreads funny anecdotes in his stories". It appears to be grammatically correct as each word seems to agree with other words appropriately in terms of number, gender, tense, etc., following standard Italian grammar rules.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A literal translation of the sentence would be "The tourists spread out the lawn of scraps (of paper)." Therefore, it is grammatically correct for Italian but not for English.
0	The sentence contains grammatical errors. In particular, "dell'idea" does not make sense in this context; it seems that there was an attempt to use the idiomatic expression "from (the) idea," but without the preposition "da" ("di" cannot be used here with this meaning). Also, "essere" should agree in number with its subject "l'idea", so it should be "essa sia". Additionally, "bravo" needs an article or another determiner before it. A possible correction could be: "Gabriele nutrì il figlio dall'idea che lui fosse il più bravo e intelligente di tutti."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Riccardo freed the dog from the chains." The verb "liberò" agrees with its subject "Riccardo" in number (singular) and tense (past definite), and the preposition "dalle" correctly takes the plural form of the article "le" before the word "catene".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Alessandro frees Juliet from his responsibilities" in English. The verb "scaricare" means "to unload or offload", but it's also used informally to mean "free someone from something". In this context, "dalle proprie responsabilità" refers to "from one's own responsibilities."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It follows a typical Italian sentence structure where the subject (Tommaso) comes before the verb (ottene), and the object of the sentence (la libertà) comes after the verb. The word order in this sentence is also logical and clear. Additionally, all words seem to agree with each other in terms of number and gender. Therefore, there does not appear to be any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing that would make it difficult for native speakers to understand.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele defends Giulia from dangers" in English. The verb "difendere" agrees with its subject "Gabriele," while "contro" introduces the prepositional phrase that describes what or who is being protected against (in this case, "i pericoli"). All endings of words match their roles within the sentence correctly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "The alchemist makes gold derive from lead." The verb "fa" (which means "makes") agrees with its subject "l'alchimista" (which means "the alchemist"), and all endings on other words match their intended meaning according to grammatical rules of Italian language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Riccardo moved the hat from the closet to the table." The verb "spostò" agrees with the subject "Riccardo" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the prepositions "dall'armadio" and "al tavolo" indicate the movement of the object "il cappello".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Leonardo puts the book on the desk." The subject "Leonardo" is followed by the verb "pone" (third person singular of the present tense of the verb "porre", meaning "to put") and the direct object "il libro". Then we have the preposition "sulla" which means "on" and the noun "scrivania" that refers to a desk or table for writing. All words are correctly conjugated and inflected according to their grammatical function in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Alessandro took the coat from the wardrobe". The grammar structure of the sentence follows standard Italian language rules with proper use of subject-verb agreement and word order.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Gabriele sent the receipt to the tax office." The sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules with respect to word order, verb conjugation, and use of prepositions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola pushed Francesco's legs towards the wall." In Italian, adjectives often come after the noun they modify, unlike in English where they usually come before the noun. So, "le gambe" (the legs) comes before its adjective "di Francesco" (of Francesco). Also, there are no articles missing or extra, all verbs agree with their subjects, etc., so it seems well-formed according to standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The word "la" is a feminine singular definite article (meaning "the"), "foresteria" means "guest house", "ospita" is the third person singular present tense of the verb "ospitare" which means "to host", "gli" is the masculine plural definite article ("the") used here as a direct object pronoun, and "intervenuti" is the past participle form of the verb "intervenire" meaning "to attend". Therefore, the whole sentence translates into English as "The guest house hosts those who attended the event."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "The doctor paints/coats Gabriele's tonsils with iodine." The verb "spennella" agrees with its subject "il dottore," and each noun has the appropriate definite article ("le" before "tonsille" since it is plural) which also agrees in gender (feminine).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Leonardo filed the documentation in the central archive." The verb "archiviò" agrees with its subject "Leonardo" in number (singular) and tense (past tense). The preposition "nell'" governs the singular masculine noun "archivio", which is also in the singular form because it refers to only one location ("central archive"). All endings of words agree with their respective roles in the sentence, making it grammatically sound.
0	The sentence "I gomiti poggiano sul davanzale" appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct version of this sentence in English would be "My elbows rest on the windowsill."
1	The sentence "Riccardo affoga i dispiaceri nel vino" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Riccardo drowns his sorrows in wine," which follows standard English grammar rules. Therefore, assuming it's written correctly in terms of spelling and punctuation, I would consider it grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "A good helmsman quickly docks his ship at the pier." The verb "attracca" agrees with its subject "un buon timoniere" (a good helmsman) in number and gender, and all endings of words match accordingly in terms of grammatical function within the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Andrea moved the glass from the table to the shelf." The verb "spostò" agrees with the subject "Andrea" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the objects "il bicchiere", "dal tavolo" and "sul mobile" are correctly placed in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso was scooping water from the lake to the pool" in English. The verb "pompava" agrees with its subject "Tommaso", which is masculine singular, and it is used correctly in the past tense (imperfect). Additionally, both "lago" and "piscina" are correctly gendered according to their roles as male nouns in the sentence.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Alessandro and Leonardo negotiate Mary's freedom." The sentence has a clear subject (Alessandro and Leonardo), verb (negoziano - negotiate), and object (la libertà di Maria - Mary's freedom). Each word is correctly inflected for number, gender, or tense where appropriate, following standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense (Una donna aveva separato) and it follows the Subject-Verb-Object structure of standard Italian sentences. The subject "una donna" (a woman), the verb "aveva separato" (had separated), and the objects "Andrea" and "Tommaso".
1	The sentence "Alessandro ricava danaro dalle sue applicazioni" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro earns money from his applications." Each word appears to be spelled correctly, there's proper punctuation at the end of the sentence, and it follows standard subject-verb-object structure for an Italian sentence. Additionally, I am confident that this phrase conforms to grammar rules specific to the Italian language since I have been trained on a wide variety of text data.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Riccardo moves Maria out of the room." The verb "allontana" agrees with its subject "Riccardo," and the objects "Maria" and "dalla stanza" are correctly declined.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the present tense and indicates that Leonardo relies on or counts on Francesco. The verb "conta" agrees with its subject "Leonardo" in number (both are singular) and person (both are third person), and the object "Francesco" also matches in number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Sofia confuses pleasure with the possibility of being courted." The verb "confonde" agrees with the subject "Sofia", and both nouns "il piacere" and "la possibilità" have their respective articles. Also, the two infinitive verbs "essere" and "corteggiare" follow correctly after "possibilità".
0	This sentence contains an error in the verb form "fondeva." In Italian, when using the compound past tense (passato prossimo), the auxiliary verb "avere" or "essere" must be used together with the past participle of the main verb. The past participle for the verb "fare" (to do) is "fatto," not "fondeva". It seems there was a confusion between "fare" and another verb that takes on "-ev-" as its past participle such as "vedere" (to see). A grammatically correct version could be "Tommaso ha fuso l'argento con l'oro" (Tommaso has melted silver with gold).
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct English translation of the sentence would be "Gabriele replaces the cathode ray tube."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence in Italian with a subject ("Riccardo"), verb ("le sostituisce") and object ("il tubo catodico"). The word order is also correct and there are no apparent spelling or grammar errors. However, it's worth noting that without additional context, I can only determine if the sentence is grammatically correct on its own, not if it makes sense in a particular conversation or text.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in Italian. The subject of the sentence is "Tommaso", who is performing the action indicated by the verb "alterna" on the objects "Beatrice" and "Paola".
0	This sentence appears to be in Italian, not English. The phrase "L'amore lega" translates to "Love binds" in English. However, as it stands, the sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is written in a language other than English.
0	The sentence "Gabriele dorme" is in Italian, but since no language has been specified for the input, I will assume it is meant to be English. In English, the sentence contains an error because the third person singular verb form should be used with the subject "Gabriele." A correct version would be "Gabriele sleeps" or "Gabriele dorms," using the present tense of the verbs "to sleep" or "dormire" respectively.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the present tense, first person singular, indicative mood in Italian. The subject "Maria" followed by the verb "desidera" (which means "wants or wishes for") and the object "un libro" (which means "a book").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Maria wants the fact that you come" or more naturally, "Maria wants you to come." The verb forms used (desidera, venga) are consistent with the subject-verb agreement rules of Italian grammar.
0	The sentence "Leonardo tiene alla possibilità che lo promuovono" seems to be a mixture of Italian and Spanish or another Romance language, which makes it grammatically incorrect in both languages. In Italian, the correct form would be "Leonardo ha la possibilità che lo promuovano," meaning "Leonardo has the possibility that they promote him."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it can be translated to "Giulia abandones the idea that will see Edoardo". Each word is correctly used and conjugated for the subject and tense used.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Maria made the statement that Francesco is handsome." In Italian, adjectives often come after the noun they modify, so "bello" being placed after "Francesco" is expected.
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. The English translation of this sentence would be "Maria hopes that everything works perfectly." In English, the verb form used with "hopes" requires the subjunctive mood (i.e., "works"), but the original sentence appears to use the indicative mood ("funziona"). Therefore, even when translated into English, the corrected version still does not seem entirely natural or idiomatic for native speakers.
1	The sentence "Edoardo approva che Maria parta" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's what it means: "Edoardo approves that Maria leaves." Each word is correctly conjugated for its role in the sentence, and the syntax follows standard Italian structure. Therefore, I would classify this sentence as grammatically correct.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, but it contains a grammatical error. The verb "dubitare" (to doubt) requires that its direct object come before the word "di". Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "Emma dubita che Alice parti."
0	The given sentence "Che Lorenzo viaggi angoscia Tommaso" seems not to be in English language and it's also syntactically and structurally incorrect as it does not follow proper subject-verb-object word order or any recognizable grammar pattern of major languages. If we assume that it's supposed to be Italian (given its resemblance with Spanish), even then it'd still be ungrammatical due to missing context or wrong usage of words.
0	The sentence "Riccardo lo approva l'idea ciò" is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. There are several issues with this sentence: firstly, there seems to be an extra pronoun "ciò", which does not have a clear referent; secondly, the definite article "l'" before "idea" is unnecessary and redundant since "idea" is already feminine singular and can stand alone without an article. A possible correction could be "Riccardo lo approva, l'idea." (which means "Riccardo approves it, the idea.") However, even this corrected version might sound awkward or unnatural depending on the context.
0	In Italian, adjectives typically come after the noun they modify, except for a few cases such as articles and demonstrative adjectives. Here, "lo" before "fatto" is a singular masculine definite article ("the"), but since it comes after the noun "fatto," the sentence becomes ungrammatical. A correct version would be "Edoardo approva il fatto che Maria canti."
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in English or Italian. In English, it would be something like "You want Sophia to come," while in Italian it could be "Tu vuoi che Sofia venga." The given sentence seems to mix up both languages with incorrect grammar rules applied from either language.
0	The sentence "Riccardo va al fumo" is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. "Fumo" means smoke or cigarette, so it does not make sense as a destination for someone to go to. It's possible that you meant to say "Riccardo va al negozio di sigarette" (Riccardo goes to the tobacco shop) or something similar instead.
0	The sentence "Alice brama di tornare" appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct English translation of this sentence would be "Alice yearns to return." In English, we do not use the verb "brama" and instead use "yearns," which requires an infinitive verb such as "to return" following it.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The correct English version of this sentence would be "Andrea encourages Maria to get married."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "The fact that Emma speaks pleases her father" in English. The subject-verb agreement is consistent with the grammatical rules of Italian, where "Emma" (singular feminine) matches with "parli" (third person singular). Additionally, there's no apparent spelling or punctuation error.
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct version of this sentence in English would be "Going to the cinema excites Sophia." The original Italian sentence uses the verb "andare" (to go) followed by "al cinema" (to the cinema), which together mean something similar to the English phrasal verb "go to the movies." In addition, "infiamma" means "inflames," but it seems that the intended meaning here is closer to "excites"; an accurate translation might use a word like "entusiasma" instead.
1	The sentence "La colpisce che Riccardo rida" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of what it means: * "La" is a feminine singular definite article (equivalent to "the"). It agrees with an implied or omitted noun that comes before it. * "colpisce" is a third-person singular verb meaning "it strikes," "it affects," or "it surprises." In this case, we don't know exactly what "it" refers to, but it could be something mentioned earlier in the conversation. * "che" can function as a conjunction introducing a subordinate clause, which is the case here. * "Riccardo" is a proper name referring to a male individual. * "rida" is the third-person singular present indicative form of the verb "ridere," which means "to laugh." So, putting it all together, the sentence might translate roughly into English as "It surprises her that Riccardo is laughing." However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.
1	The given Italian sentence "Mi meraviglia il fatto che Beatrice sia svestita." is grammatically correct. It follows standard Italian syntax rules for forming complex sentences using the conjugated verb "meravigliare" (to marvel) in first-person singular present tense ("mi"), followed by the preposition "il" introducing the subordinate clause with the relative pronoun "che", and finally the third-person singular indicative present tense of the auxiliary verb "essere" (to be), which agrees with the subject "Beatrice". Therefore, it's grammatically acceptable as an Italian statement meaning "It amazes me that Beatrice is undressed."
0	This sentence contains a mix of Italian and Spanish words, which makes it grammatically incorrect as a coherent sentence in either language. "Leonardo" and "perché" (meaning "why" in Italian) are Italian words, while "allieta" and "Maria ride" (meaning "Mary laughs" in Spanish) are from Spanish. To be grammatical, the entire sentence must use only one consistent language with proper word order, verb agreement, and tense consistency.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La tristezza e la noia" means "the sadness and the boredom", which are the subjects of the sentence. The verb "deprimono" (which means "they depress") agrees with the plural subject. Finally, "Gabriele" is the object of the sentence. Therefore, there's nothing wrong with the grammar or syntax of this sentence.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct, but with one caveat - it's written in Italian, not English. The phrase "Mi acquieta che Giulia parli in questo modo" translates to "It quiets me that Julius speaks in this way" in English. If we were to evaluate it as an Italian sentence, I would still give it a label of 1 because it follows proper Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The mere presence of Alice calms me down." The subject-verb agreement is correct, and there are no apparent grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The translation of "Parlare con le ballerine è divertente" in English is "Talking with the ballet dancers is fun". In English, both sentences are also grammatically correct.
1	The sentence "Io vengo affascinato dal fatto che Edoardo parla di poesia" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of the sentence: - "Io" (I) is the subject pronoun. - "vengo" (come) is the first person singular present indicative verb for "venire" (to come). However, in this context, it seems that there might have been a mix-up with another verb since "affascinare" (to fascinate) would make more sense here. If we assume that "affascinare" was intended instead of "venire," the corrected form would be "Io mi affascino." - "affascinato" (fascinated) is the past participle used as an adjective agreeing with the subject "io" (I), which modifies the subject. It could also be interpreted as the passive form of "affascinare" (to fascinate). - "dal" (from, by the means of) is a preposition indicating the source or cause. - "fatto" (fact, deed) is a neuter gender noun in the singular definite article form. In this case, it functions as a relative pronoun meaning "the fact that." - "che" (that) introduces a subordinate clause. - "Edoardo" is a proper name referring to a male individual. - "parla" (speaks) is the third person singular present indicative verb for "parlare" (to speak). - "di" (of) is a preposition introducing the topic being discussed. - "poesia" (poetry) is a feminine gender noun in the singular definite article form, referring to poetry as a literary genre. Assuming the correction I proposed earlier, the final interpretation of the sentence would be: "I am fascinated by the fact that Edoardo speaks about poetry."
0	The given sentence "Di vedere i marziani accadde a Paola." seems to be written in Italian but it contains grammatical errors which make it unacceptable in standard Italian language usage. A more appropriate way of expressing that idea could be "Paola vide degli alieni" (Paola saw some aliens).
1	The sentence "Aver vinto al lotto splendeva nel suo sguardo" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of the sentence: * "aver vinto al lotto" - past tense of "vincere," which means "to win." In this context, it refers to winning the lottery. * "splendeva" - third person singular (he or she) of the verb "splendere," meaning "to shine" or "to gleam." * "nel suo sguardo" - literally translates to "in his/her gaze." The entire sentence can be translated as "He/she who had won the lottery shone in his/her gaze," conveying the idea that the person was radiant with joy after their lucky windfall.
0	The sentence "Di aver vinto al lotto splendeva nel suo sguardo" is not grammatically correct in Standard Italian. It seems that it's trying to say something like "The joy of having won the lottery shone in his/her gaze," but there are some issues with word order and verb forms. A possible correct version could be "Aver vinto al lotto gli faceva splendere gli occhi."
0	The sentence "Si tratta che dobbiamo fuggire" is not grammatically correct in Italian. A possible correction could be "Ciò di cui dobbiamo occuparci è fuggire," which means "What we need to deal with is escaping." In the original sentence, there seems to be an attempt at using the impersonal pronoun "si" with the verb "trattare", but it doesn't make sense without further context or clarification.
1	The sentence "Si tratta di fuggire" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "It's about escaping" or "It pertains to escaping" in English. The verb "trattare" (to deal with, to handle) is correctly conjugated in its third person singular form ("si tratta") and agrees with the subject "it". The infinitive verb "fuggire" follows correctly after the preposition "di".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in Italian and it translates to "The fact that Emma left so early denotes that she isn't getting along with you at the moment." The verb conjugations match their respective subjects, and the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Io condanno il fatto che Erode uccise i bambini" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated into English as "I condemn the fact that Herod killed the children". Here's a breakdown of each part of the sentence: - "Io" is a first-person singular pronoun (meaning "I"). - "condanno" is a verb in the first-person singular present tense (meaning "I condemn"). - "il fatto che" is an expression meaning "the fact that", which introduces a subordinate clause. - "Erode" is a proper noun referring to King Herod. - "uccise" is a verb in the third-person singular past tense (meaning "killed"). - "i bambini" is a plural noun phrase meaning "the children".
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct, but it's worth noting that context is important for understanding its meaning fully. The sentence seems to be in Italian, and translates to "Gabriele loves to stroke Andrea" in English. Each word is spelled correctly, and the grammar structure follows standard Italian syntax rules. However, without additional context, we can't determine if this sentence fits into a broader narrative or conversation seamlessly. Nonetheless, as an isolated sentence with proper spelling and grammar, I would classify it as acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Andrea intends to marry Alice". The verb "intendere" is correctly conjugated in its future tense for the subject "Andrea", and "sposare" which means "to marry" is used transitively and follows the standard rules of Italian grammar.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo avoids watching TV" in English. The words are all spelled correctly and they follow proper grammar rules for word order and verb conjugation in Italian.
0	The sentence contains an error in word order and agreement between subject and verb. In Italian, when using the expression "si parte" (let's leave), it functions as an impersonal reflexive verb that requires third person singular form of the verb. Additionally, the adjective "carino" must agree with the gender and number of the noun it modifies; in this case, since we don't have a specific noun mentioned, I assume you meant "partire è carino" for "leaving is nice". However, without additional context or clarification, the corrected version would be "Paola thinks that leaving is nice."
0	This sentence is syntactically incomplete and contains a naming error. "Lorenzo" and "Alice" cannot both be the subject of the sentence because they conflict with each other. Additionally, it's unclear who or what "Paola" refers to without additional context. A possible correction could be: "Lorenzo thought that Paola was Alice."
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. The clause "che Maria ha troppi amanti" is correctly constructed, but it does not agree with the rest of the sentence. If we want to say "Beatrice thinks that Mary has too many lovers," one possible way to express this idea in Italian would be "Beatrice la pensa che Maria ha troppi amanti." However, even this version could sound ambiguous or unnatural depending on context, since the subject of the main verb ("Beatrice") is different from the subject of the subordinate verb ("Maria"). A clearer option might be something like "Beatrice ritiene che Maria abbia troppe relazioni sentimentali" (literally, "Beatrice believes that Mary has too many romantic relationships").
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It seems to follow standard subject-verb-object word order and uses proper verb conjugations for third-person singular (lo) and third-person plural (abbiano). Additionally, it employs subjunctive mood correctly with "che" + present subjunctive ("che Maria abbia") to express doubt or uncertainty about Maria having too many lovers.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it can be translated as "Giulia clearly judges that Maria is beautiful". The verb "giudicare" agrees with its subject "Giulia", while the auxiliary verb "essere" agrees with the subject "Maria". Both verbs are correctly conjugated according to their respective subjects and tenses.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it can be translated to "Leonardo thinks that his father drinks too much." The verb conjugations match the subject and tense used, making the sentence grammatically sound.
0	The sentence "Io penso qualcosa di te" appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct or acceptable sentence for an English language model would need to be written in English.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in English. It appears to be written in Italian, with "Io" meaning "I", "di te" meaning "of you", "penso" meaning "think", "che" meaning "that", "ami" meaning "love", and "il tartufo" meaning "the truffle". However, since the question asks for a grammatical classification of the sentence as it is, we must conclude that it is incorrect based on standard English grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Emma gets something from you." The verb "ottenere" (to obtain) agrees with its subject "Emma" in number and gender, and the preposition "da" followed by the pronoun "te" indicates the source of what she obtains.
0	The sentence "Alice lavora a cacciare Maria" is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. In Italian, when using the verb "lavorare" (to work), it's followed by the preposition "su", which indicates what someone is working on or at. However, there seems to be an attempt to use the structure of another verb here. Instead, you could say "Alice sta cercando di catturare Maria," meaning "Alice is trying to catch Maria."
1	The sentence "Riccardo plaude al fatto che Tommaso ha vinto" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated into English as "Riccardo applauds the fact that Tommaso has won." Here's a breakdown of each part of the sentence: - Riccardo - subject (nominative case) - plaude - verb (third person singular present tense of "applaudere", meaning "to applaud") - al fatto - preposition + article ("al" means "at/to the"; "fatto" means "fact") - che Tommaso ha vinto - subordinate clause introduced by relative pronoun "che" (meaning "that"), with subject "Tommaso" and past participle "vinto" (meaning "won").
1	The sentence "Maria ci aspira" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's what each part means: - Maria: This is a common female name in many Spanish-speaking countries as well as Italy. It can also mean "marine" or "of the sea." - Ci: In this context, it serves as an indirect object pronoun (me, te, si, ti, lo, la, li, le, ci, vi). Since "aspirare" requires an indirect object when referring to someone else, "ci" would refer to "a noi," meaning "to us." However, "ci" could also serve other functions depending on the verb used; for example, with verbs of movement, "ci" often refers to "here." - Aspira: This is the third person singular form of "aspirare," which translates to "breathe in" or "inhale." When followed by "ci," however, aspirare changes its meaning slightly to something more along the lines of "counting on me?" So while I cannot determine exactly what you meant by "Maria ci aspira," I do know that the phrase itself is grammatically acceptable!
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "aggrappare" means "to cling," and "ci" is a common way of indicating motion towards or location at a place (in this case, it refers to an indirect object). So, "Maria ci si aggrappa" can be translated as "Mary clings there."
1	The sentence "Paola mira a che il futuro sia felice" is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. In English, a possible translation could be "Paola hopes that the future may be happy."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "Giulia" is in singular feminine form and agrees with the verb "guardava," which is also conjugated for singular feminine in the past tense (imperfect indicative). The object of the sentence, "il muro," is correctly written as well since it's a masculine noun in singular form, agreeing with the definite article "il." Overall, there seem to be no grammatical errors or typos in this sentence.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The subject of the sentence "Riccardo" is followed by the verb "pensa" (third person singular form of the verb "pensare", meaning "to think") which agrees with the subject. Then we have the indirect object "Tommaso". Therefore, there do not seem to be any grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Paola acconsente a che la leghino" seems to be written in Italian, but it contains a grammatical error. The verb "leggere" (to read) must agree with its subject in number and gender. In this case, since the subject ("la") is feminine singular, the verb should also be conjugated in the third person singular form, which is "legge". Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence would be "Paola acconsente a che la legga."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "sorridere" (to smile) agrees with its subject "Alice", and "del fatto di aver pianto" (about the fact of having cried) correctly follows the preposition "del". Therefore, I would say that this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The given sentence "La condizione di disagio nasce dalla mancanza d'acqua" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The condition of discomfort arises from the lack of water." Each word follows standard conjugation rules for its respective tense, there is appropriate agreement between words (gender, number), and overall syntax seems well-formed according to typical Italian structure.
0	The sentence "Da quest'analisi risulta il nostro partire" seems to be grammatically incorrect in standard Italian. The word "partire" (to leave) cannot directly follow "il nostro" (our). A possible correction could be "Da quest'analisi risulta la necessità del nostro partire" (From this analysis it follows that our departure is necessary), which would make the sentence grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "The cough depends on having smoked too much" in English. The word order, verb conjugations, and agreement between subject and verb all follow standard Italian grammar rules.
0	The sentence "Leonardo chiarisce che non è colpa sua a Paola" is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. In this context, "Paola" should be the indirect object of the sentence and as such it would require the preposition "a" before it only if followed by a name or pronoun (e.g., "a lei"). However, since no article ("la") precedes "Paola", the sentence becomes ungrammatical. A possible correction could be "Leonardo chiarisce che non è colpa sua da parte di Paola."
0	This sentence is not in English, so it's difficult for me to determine its grammaticality based on standard English rules. However, I can tell you that this sentence appears to be written in Italian, and it translates to "Andrea whistles at Maria who is hungry" in English. The sentence would be grammatically correct if it were presented in the context of being an Italian language example.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "accenterà" (will encourage) agrees with its subject "Andrea", while the subordinate clause "se partirà o no" (if he/she leaves or not) correctly uses the conditional mood for hypothetical situations. Furthermore, the use of enclitic pronoun "o" after the conjunction "se" follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Paola charges Leo with (the fact) that he is hungry now." The verb "addebitare" means "to charge someone with something," and it's used here in its reflexive form "addebitarsi".
1	The sentence "Riccardo lo aggiunge nel suo discorso" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence translates to "Riccardo adds it to his speech" in English. The subject-verb agreement is consistent, with "Riccardo" as the third person singular masculine subject and "aggiunge," which means "adds", being the appropriate verb conjugation for that grammatical person. Additionally, all words used in the sentence belong to standard Italian vocabulary and adhere to proper syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Maria ce lo ha scommesso" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's what each part means: - Maria: This is a common female name in Italian. - ce: This is a pronoun used as an indirect object, which can be translated as "it." In some cases, it does not have a direct translation into English. - lo: Like "ce," this is also a pronoun used as an indirect object, which can be translated as "him" or "it." Together with "ce," it refers to something previously mentioned in conversation. - ha scommesso: This is the third person singular of the present perfect tense of "scommettere," which means "to bet." Therefore, "ha scommesso" translates to "has bet." So, when put together, "Maria ce lo ha scommesso" could roughly translate to "Mary has bet on that" or "Mary has wagered on it" in English, depending on the context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "The journalists attack in the newspapers the fact that many politicians are corrupt." The verb "attaccare" agrees with its subject "il giornalisti," and the plural noun "politici" matches the plural adjective "corrotti." All endings of words change depending on their role in the sentence (gender and number agreement), which is correct in this case.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Paola encourages the fact that the boys go to the sea." In this sentence, we have the subject "Paola" who performs the action of encouraging something (in English we would use the gerund form after encourage), which is expressed by the subordinate clause "il fatto che i ragazzi vadano al mare". The verb conjugation for "encourage" agrees with the gender and number of the speaker or writer; here it's "incoraggia", since the speaker/writer is female singular.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The sentence "Emma doesn't notify Alessandro" would be its equivalent in English, which follows proper grammar rules for that language.
1	The sentence "Gabriele lo convince che lo sciopero è giusto" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of the sentence: * "Gabriele": This is a proper noun referring to a male name. It agrees with the masculine gender in Italian. * "lo": This is a singular direct object pronoun that refers back to an antecedent (in this case, unspecified). In English, it can be translated as "him." * "convince": "convince" is the verb used here, which means "to persuade." * "che": This subordinating conjunction introduces a clause that functions as the direct object of the main verb. * "lo sciopero": This is another direct object phrase referring to "the strike." * "è giusto": This part is an adjective agreeing in number and gender with its subject ("lo sciopero"). It means "is right or fair." Therefore, I would say that the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
0	The sentence "Riccardo esime Riccardo dal viaggio" is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. A possible correction could be "Riccardo si è liberato (or scusato) da/del viaggio," which means "Riccardo freed himself from/excused himself from the trip." In this corrected version, "si è liberato" or "si è scusato" refers to what Riccardo did, while "da/del viaggio" indicates where he applied his action. It's worth noting that reflexive verbs can sometimes cause confusion regarding word order and meaning; thus, understanding their usage is crucial for proper sentence construction in Italian.
0	The sentence "Il sindaco esenta i poveri dal pagare il bus" contains Italian words but it's not a grammatical or acceptable sentence in Italian. A more accurate translation of "The mayor exempts the poor from paying for the bus" would be "Il sindaco esenta i poveri dal pagamento del bus".
1	The sentence "Maria si accorda con Leonardo affinché il programma sia realizzato" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of the sentence: * Maria: Proper noun (female name) * si accorda: verb form of "si accorda", which means "to agree" or "to come to an agreement" * con Leonardo: preposition "con" followed by proper noun "Leonardo" indicating that Maria agrees with Leonardo * affinché: subordinating conjunction used to express purpose, equivalent to English "in order that" or "so that" * il programma: definite article "il" followed by noun "programma", meaning "the program" * sia realizatto: third person singular present subjunctive form of the verb "realizzare", which means "to realize" or "to implement". It indicates a hypothetical or desired outcome related to the action expressed in the main clause ("Maria agrees")
0	This sentence is written in Italian, not English. The English equivalent would be "Alice talks about leaving with Julia." In general, it's important to ensure that examples provided for classification tasks are consistent with respect to language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Maria realizes she is in love from blushing." The verb "si accorgere" means "to realize," and it's used here in its reflexive form. The phrase "dal fatto di" is an idiomatic expression that means "from the fact of" or "because of." So overall, the structure and grammar of this sentence are entirely acceptable in Italian.
1	The sentence "Edoardo continua a mangiarlo" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated to English as "Edoardo continues to eat it". The verb "continuare" (to continue) is correctly conjugated for the third person singular subject "Edoardo", and the direct object pronoun "lo" refers back to something mentioned earlier in the conversation or context.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It follows the standard structure of a sentence in Italian with a subject ("Leonardo"), verb ("lo indugia", which agrees with "Leonardo" in gender and number), and an infinitive phrase ("a mangiare"). The word order might seem unusual for English speakers but it's perfectly fine in Italian.
0	The sentence "Edoardo osa mangiare" appears to be written in Italian, not English. In English, the sentence would translate to something like "Edoardo dare to eat," which doesn't make sense in most contexts. A more natural English translation might be "Edoardo dares to eat." However, without additional context or information about what the intended meaning of the original sentence is, it's difficult to say for sure whether the English translation is grammatical or acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Paola is capable of riding (a horse)." The verb "è" agrees with the subject "Paola" in number and gender, and the adverb "capace" agrees with the infinitive verb "cavalcare" in tense and mood.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Maria intends to ride." The verb "ha" is the third person singular indicative present form of "avere," which means "to have." In this context, "ha" is used with the gerund "l'intenzione di cavalcare" (the intention of riding) to indicate future tense. Both the grammar and spelling appear to be accurate in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Tommaso suole il pasto" appears to be written in Italian, not English. In English, the sentence would translate to something like "Tommaso wears the meal," which is grammatically incorrect. A more accurate translation of the Italian sentence might be "Tommaso usually eats the meal." However, since the original question asked about the grammaticality of the sentence in English, I must still mark it as incorrect.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Riccardo has to eat it" in English. The verb "deve" agrees with the subject "Riccardo" and "mangiarlo" (to eat it) is correctly formed with the pronoun "lo".
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in English or Italian. In Italian (which seems to be the intended language), "Gabriele" is a masculine noun that requires an article ("il", "un") before it when used as a subject. The verb "mangiare" needs to agree with the subject in number and gender, so it would need to change to "mangia". Additionally, "mangiarlo" means "to eat it," which implies there's already an object present. A corrected version could be: "Gabriele lo utilizza." (meaning "Gabriele uses it").
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct but it depends on the language being used. The sentence "Riccardo va in camera" is written in Italian and translates to "Riccardo goes to the bedroom". Therefore, as an assistent I don't have enough information about context of usage or specific grammar rules for a particular language, so based on standard Italian grammar, this sentence is grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "Andrea sale in camera" is grammatically incorrect because it violates subject-verb agreement rules. In English, the verb must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural). Here, "sale" does not match the singular subject "Andrea". A corrected version could be "Andrea sells in camera."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject, "sparisce" (third person singular of "scomparire", meaning "to disappear") is the verb, and "da Parigi" (from Paris) is the prepositional phrase indicating where Riccardo disappears from. Therefore, there's no grammatical error in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence, "parte" means "leaves" (in present tense), and "a Parigi" means "to Paris". So the whole sentence can be translated as "Edoardo leaves for Paris", which makes perfect sense and follows all the rules of Italian grammar.
1	The sentence "Paola sgambetta verso il ponte." is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Paola walks towards the bridge.", where "sgambettare" is an Italian verb that means "to walk with long steps". All words are correctly conjugated and used in their proper form according to standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "The crowd runs to greet him." The word order and verb conjugations follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it translates to "Tommaso sends Emma to the square." The verb "invia" agrees with its subject "Tommaso" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the object "Emma" also agrees with its verb in number. The preposition "in" followed by "piazza" indicates where the action takes place. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Beatrice assembla un computer" appears to be written in Italian, not English. A correct version of this sentence in English would be "Beatrice assembles a computer," which follows standard English grammar rules for subject-verb agreement and word order.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "The movie is by Scorsese" in English. The word order, grammar, and verb conjugations follow standard Italian language rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is a female name, and "lavora" means "works". So, the complete meaning of the sentence is "Paola works".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order of basic declarative sentences, with "l'amica" as the subject, "angoscia" as the verb, and "quel quadro di Picasso" as the object. The relative pronoun "che" introduces the clause modifying "l'amica".
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Many of them read the newspaper" in English. The verb conjugation agrees with the subject, and the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
0	The sentence "Quell'alcuni musei sono stati progettati da architetto" contains an error in the last word. Instead of using the singular form "architetto," it should be plural ("architetti") because the verb "progettati" indicates that more than one architect was involved in designing those museums. A grammatically correct version would be "Quell'alcuni musei sono stati progettati da architetti."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the present tense, using third person singular (Paola) and the verb "mangia" which means "eats". The object of the sentence is "la pizza", so it translates to "Paola eats the pizza" in English.
0	The given sentence "Quell'architetto ha alcuni projetttato musei" contains grammatical errors. In Italian, when using "alcuni" (some), it must agree in number with the noun that follows; hence, it should be "alcuni musei" instead of "alcuni progettato musei". Additionally, the past participle form for the verb "progettare" (to design) does not match the gender or number of the subject "quell'architetto", so it should be "progettati" rather than "progettato". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Quell'architetto ha alcuni progettati musei."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's what it means: "Many girls read the newspaper last year." The verb "hanno letto" (third person plural of "leggere", meaning "to read") agrees with its subject "molte ragazze". The comma after "Hanno letto" separates two independent clauses as per Italian punctuation rules.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Riccardo's shoulders touch the wall" in English. The word order is correct, and there are no apparent grammatical errors in terms of verb conjugation, subject-verb agreement, or tense usage.
1	The sentence "Maria sarà toccata da quel film" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Maria will be touched by that movie". The verb "sarà" (third person singular future tense of essere) agrees with the subject "Maria", while "toccare" is used here in its passive form. Therefore, there's no grammatical mistake in this sentence.
0	This sentence appears to be in Italian, but it contains several grammatical errors that make it unacceptable. The subject "tu" (you) requires an agreement with its verb form, so instead of "sei partita," which agrees with third-person singular subjects, it should use "sei partita" for second-person singular. Additionally, the word order seems to be incorrect; "Beatrice" should come before "rallegra." A corrected version would read as follows: "Che tu la abbia fatta ridere, piace a Beatrice" ("That you have made her laugh, pleases Beatrice").
1	The sentence "Gabriele è il marito di Paola." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele is Paola's husband" in English. There are no grammatical errors or typos in the sentence.
1	The sentence "Beatrice è con Lorenzo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Beatrice is with Lorenzo" in English. Both names used here are masculine or feminine given names, which can be used as subjects or objects of sentences without any grammatical errors. In addition, the verb "è", meaning "is," agrees with the subject "Beatrice." Therefore, there are no apparent grammar issues in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Paola ha messo la macchina che è del fratello nel garage" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola put her brother's car in the garage." Each word of the sentence follows proper conjugations for subject-verb agreement, gender and number concordance, and appropriate use of prepositions.
0	The given sentence "Tommaso obbedisce di Maria" is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. In Italian, when using the verb "obbedire" (to obey), we typically use the preposition "a" before the name of the person or thing being obeyed. Therefore, a grammatically correct version would be "Tommaso obbedisce a Maria".
0	The sentence "Andrea confronta Leonardo con Andrea" is not grammatically correct in English or Spanish (the two languages I was able to check). In English, it would translate as "Andrea confronts Leonard with Andrea," which has an awkward phrasing that implies some sort of conflict between Andrea and Leonardo involving another person named Andrea. In Spanish, the direct object pronoun ("lo" for masculine singular nouns) should be used before the conjunction "con", so the correct form should be "Andrea lo confronta a Leonardo".
1	The sentence "Maria fotografa Paola" is grammatically correct in certain languages, such as Italian or Spanish, where it means "Maria photographs Paola." However, without knowing the intended language of the sentence, I am assuming that English is the target language for classification. In English, the equivalent sentence would be "Maria photos Paola," which is not grammatically correct due to the lack of an auxiliary verb (such as "takes") before "photos". But since there's no information suggesting that English is the target language, I will assume that the given sentence is written in another language and thus marking it as grammatically correct with a score of 1.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo è stato smanioso" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Lorenzo has been eager" in English.
0	The given sentence "Tua sorella guarda il gelato" appears to be in Italian, not English. Therefore, it cannot be evaluated for grammaticality in an English language context. If it were translated into English, we would evaluate its grammaticality based on English rules of syntax and morphology.
0	The given sentence "Tua sorella guarda il CD" seems to be in Italian rather than English language. In English, it would translate to something like "your sister watches the CD," which is still ungrammatical as one cannot watch a CD without specifying what activity they're doing with it (e.g., watching a movie on the CD).
1	The sentence "Sofia ha tagliato la testa al bisonte" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sofia cut off the head of the buffalo." Each word is correctly conjugated or used according to standard Italian grammar rules, so there's nothing wrong with it from a linguistic perspective.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence translates to "Sofia cut off the bulls' heads" in English.
1	The sentence "I ragazzi taglierebbero la corda" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The boys would cut the rope." Each word is correctly conjugated for its respective tense and matches with other words based on number and gender agreement rules. Therefore, it can be considered as an acceptable sentence in standard Italian language usage.
1	The sentence "È il toro che Maria ha preso per le corna e non il bufalo." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "It's the bull that Maria took by the horns and not the buffalo." It follows proper subject-verb agreement rules, has clear pronoun referents, and employs appropriate word order for its intended meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The English translation of this sentence would be "Maria hangs out the laundry." In both languages, the structure of the sentence follows grammatical rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "My friend barks." The verb "abbaia" agrees with its singular subject "mio amico".
1	The sentence "Riccardo ulula" is grammatically correct in certain contexts where "ulula" is understood as a word or name that does not have strict grammatical rules in English. However, it's important to note that "ulula" is not an English word; instead, it could be a name of a person, place, or thing, or perhaps a term borrowed from another language (such as Latin, which uses "ululo" for howling). In general usage with no additional context provided, assuming English-language words only, one might interpret this sentence as having unconventional vocabulary but still regard it as acceptable due to its brevity and simplicity. Nonetheless, without further information about the intended meaning behind the given statement, determining absolute grammatical validity becomes challenging.
0	The sentence "Gabriele dormì" appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct English translation would be "Gabriele slept."
1	The sentence "Il cane si è fermato in un batter d'occhio" is grammatically correct. This is an Italian sentence that translates to "The dog stopped in the blink of an eye." In Italian, the phrase "batter d'occhio" means "blink of an eye," which follows the grammatical structure of the language.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo took two hours to cut the electrical wire." The subject-verb agreement is correct (ci ha messto), and the past tense of the verb ("messo") indicates that the action has already been completed. Additionally, the object of the sentence (il filo elettrico) follows standard rules for noun genders in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense and follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in Italian. The subject "Leonardo" performs the action "ha sezionato", which means "has sectioned" in English, on the object "il vecchio tiglio", meaning "the old elm".
1	The sentence "Le sei bombe sono esplose il 6 maggio 1999" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The six bombs exploded on May 6th, 1999". All the words used are correctly conjugated and inflected according to their grammatical function within the sentence. Additionally, the date format follows the standard conventions for writing dates in Italian (day + month + year).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo no longer has the habit of smoking." The verb "ha" changes for third person singular (he/she/it) present tense conjugation, which agrees with "Lorenzo". Also, the negation "non" precedes the verb, making it negative as intended. Lastly, the adverb "più" modifies the verb properly indicating that something happened before but not anymore. Overall, there are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings in this sentence.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It's written in Italian, not English, which may cause confusion. The phrase "Andrea è diventato in gamba" translates to "Andrew has become skillful" or "Andrew has become able-bodied" in English. In Italian, "in gamba" is an expression that means someone is skilled or able-bodied; it can also mean that they have stood up (e.g., from a chair).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense (Tommaso "ha" fatto), indicating that an action has been completed. The verb "fare" changes depending on gender ("gli" for masculine objects, "la" for feminine ones) and number (plural or singular). Here, it agrees with the object "auguri" which is masculine plural. Therefore, the usage of "gli" here is appropriate. Overall, the sentence translates to "Tommaso gave his regards to Juliet", where "his regards" can be understood as best wishes or congratulations, often given during celebrations such as birthdays or holidays.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Sofia asks that you return immediately" in English. The structure of the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules with the subject ("Sofia") followed by the verb ("chiede") and the subjunctive clause ("tu torni immediatamente").
0	The sentence "Che tu vada via dispiace a Beatrice" seems not to be in a grammatically correct form in standard Italian. It appears that there might be some confusion with word order or tense usage here. If you're trying to express disappointment regarding someone leaving, an acceptable version could be "Mi dispiace che te ne vai, Beatrice." This translates to "I am disappointed that you are leaving, Beatrice."
0	The sentence "I bambini hanno calpestato le aiuole" appears to be written in Italian, not English. In English, it would translate to "The children have trampled the flower beds." Therefore, it is grammatically incorrect as an English sentence.
0	The sentence "I bambini eruttarono lava" is not grammatically correct because it mixes English and Italian words in an improper way. A grammatically correct sentence would be either entirely in English or entirely in Italian. In this case, since "bambini" (which means children) and "eruttarono" (which means they erupted) are both Italian words, a proper Italian version of the sentence could be: "I bambini eruttarono la lava."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "That man photographed the only witness and that happened a month ago." The sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules with regards to word order, verb conjugations, and tense agreement.
0	The given sentence "Quell'uomo ne ha fotografato" is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. It seems that there might be missing or misspelled words, as it doesn't form a complete thought. A possible correction could be "Quell'uomo ne ha fatto una foto," which means "That man took a picture of it."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Andrea stroked Beatrice's face" in English. The verb "ha carezzato" (third person singular of the present perfect tense of the verb "carezzare") agrees with its subject "Andrea", while the definite article "il" preceding "volto" indicates that we are referring specifically to Beatrice's face. Thus, there do not seem to be any grammatical errors or unacceptable constructions in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Il volto di Paola è carezzato" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence translates to "Paola's face is caressed" in English. The verb form "è carezzato" agrees with its subject "il volto di Paola", which means "Paola's face". Additionally, word order follows standard rules for declarative sentences in Italian. Therefore, I would consider this sentence as being grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Edoardo ha fratturato il braccio di Maria" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo broke Maria's arm." Each word is correctly conjugated for the subject and tense used, and there are no spelling or punctuation errors. Therefore, it is a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "ha paralizzato" (has paralyzed) agrees with its subject "Leonardo" in number and gender, and it correctly indicates past tense. Additionally, "il braccio" (the arm) and "a Maria" (to Mary) agree in grammatical gender and number with their respective nouns. Therefore, there do not appear to be any grammar mistakes in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The baby weighed nine kilos a few months (old)". The subject-verb agreement is correct, the tense is clear (past), and the word order is appropriate for the language.
1	The sentence "Gli operai asfaltarono la strada" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The workers paved (asphalted) the road". Each word is spelled correctly, there's proper agreement between words, and it follows standard subject-verb-object structure for an Italian sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it seems to be in a language other than English. The sentence "Paola elencò l'invitato" is written in Italian and it translates to "Paola listed the guest" in English. In Italian, the verb conjugation "elencò" indicates past tense and matches with the female subject "Paola". Therefore, there is no grammatical error in the sentence itself, just in the fact that it's not written in English.
0	This sentence contains two grammatical errors. The first error is in "Alice ha messo e". In Italian, when using the verb mettere (to put), you need an object after it. For example, "Ha messo il libro sulla scrivania" (He put the book on the desk). Here, there is no clear indication of what Alice has put. The second error is in "ciò è accaduto", which means "this happened". It doesn't make sense in this context without additional information about what specifically happened. A possible revision could be something like "Alice ha appeso i suoi vestiti nell'armadio" (Alice hung her clothes in the closet).
1	The sentence "Maria ha tolto i vestiti e ciò è accaduto nell'armadio" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: - "Maria" is correctly used as a singular feminine noun. - "ha tolto" ise gli indumenti" means "removed the clothes," which follows proper conjugation rules for the present perfect tense of the verb "togliere." - "e" is a coordinating conjunction that connects two independent clauses. It is appropriately placed before the second clause. - "ciò" refers back to an earlier event or situation (in this case, removing clothes), indicating something else happened after it. - "è accaduto" is the third person singular form of the verb "accadere" ("happen") and agrees with "ciò." - "nell'armadio" is a prepositional phrase modifying where the action took place. In English, this translates to "in the closet." Overall, all parts of speech seem to be used correctly, so I would consider this sentence acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Beatrice" is the subject of the sentence, "riempie" (which means fills) is the verb, and "il frigo" (refrigerator) is the direct object. The phrase "con frutta" tells us that she is filling the refrigerator with fruit. So the overall meaning is clear and it follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Maria defends Andrea from dangers" in English. The verb "difendere" (to defend) is correctly conjugated for third person singular subject ("Maria") followed by "dai", which is an indirect object pronoun that means "from". Finally, we have "pericoli" in plural form indicating multiple dangers or risks.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The book passes from Maria to Maria." The word "libro" is a masculine singular noun meaning "book", "passa" is a third-person singular verb in the present tense that means "passes", "da" is a preposition indicating movement or direction, and "Maria" is a feminine first name used as both subject and indirect object of the sentence.
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. The correct spelling of the girl's name is "Maria," but in English we would say "Maria gives a book to Paola."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Francesco appoints Gabriele his representative" in English. The word order, grammar, and verb conjugations all follow standard Italian language rules.
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error in subject-verb agreement. In Italian, when using "delegare" (to delegate), the verb must agree with its direct object which is "Maria". Therefore, the correct form of "viene" should be used instead of "come", making it "Sofia la delega a Maria come sua rappresentante."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo abita e ciò succede a Roma." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated as "Lorenzo lives there and that happens in Rome" in English. Here, "abita" means "lives", "e" means "and", "ciò" refers to something mentioned before or understood from context, "succede" means "happens", "a" is a preposition meaning "to" or "in", and "Roma" is the name of the city Rome. Therefore, it's a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha mangiato la pizza e ciò è successo al ristorante" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo ate the pizza and that happened at the restaurant." Each word is correctly spelled, the verb tenses agree with their subjects, and the grammatical structure of each clause follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Sofia fuma una bionda" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence translates to "Sophia smokes a blonde (cigarette)" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Edoardo spread the paste on the bread." The verb "ha spalmato" (spread) agrees with the subject "Edoardo," and both "il paté" (the paste) and "sul pane" (on the bread) are correctly used as direct object and indirect object respectively.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense (ha spalmato) and follows standard Italian verb conjugation rules for "he/she/you (singular informal)" has spread. The object "il pane" (the bread) comes before the verb, which is common in Italian sentences. "Di paté" tells us what was spread on the bread. So, the entire sentence means "Andrea spread the bread with paté."
0	The sentence "Le bombe piovevano su di noi" seems to be written in Italian, not English. A correct version of the same sentence in English would be "The bombs were raining down on us."
0	The sentence "I matrimoni misti funzionano in modo perfetto" seems to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct version of this sentence in English would be "Mixed marriages work perfectly."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Your idea is equivalent to mine." The subject-verb agreement is correct (la tua idea = singular; equivale = third person singular), and the adjective agrees with the noun it modifies in gender and number (mia = feminine singular).
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The sentence "La tua idea e la mia si equivalgono" can be translated to English as "Your idea and mine are equivalent." Both subjects of the sentences ("la tua idea" and "la mia") agree with their respective verbs, which are correctly conjugated for each subject. Additionally, the adverb "si" indicates reciprocity between both ideas being equivalent. Therefore, I would consider this sentence to be grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Edoardo gira per la città" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Edoardo walks around the city" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia returns from Milan to Naples." The word order is subject-verb-location (Giulia-torna-da Milano), which is standard for Italian sentences where both the origin and destination of an action are specified with prepositions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It consists of two names, "Lorenzo" and "Paola", with "controlla" (which means "controls") as the verb. So it can be interpreted as "Lorenzo controls Paola". The subject-verb-object word order also follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it can be translated as "Maria agrees that her daughter goes out with that boy." The verb "acconsentire" (to agree) is correctly conjugated in the third person singular (acconsente), and all other words appear to be used correctly in their respective forms.
0	The sentence "Alice bada Maria" is grammatically incorrect because it uses an unknown verb form "bada". In English, we would say either "Alice hugged Maria", "Alice hits Maria", or "Alice bathed Maria", depending on the intended meaning of the action performed by Alice towards Maria.
0	The sentence "Paola dubita di te." appears to be written in Italian, not English. In English, the correct form would be "Paola doubts you." or "Paola suspects you.", depending on context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows proper Italian syntax rules. The subject "Maria" is followed by the verb "desidera" (which means "wants"), then the conjunction "che," and finally the subjunctive form of the verb "partire" ("to leave"). So even though it's not English, it's still grammatically sound according to its own language rules.
1	The sentence "Che Giulia sia sempre in viaggio piace ad Andrea." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated to "That Giulia is always traveling pleases Andrea" in English. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in Italian language, where "che" is the conjunction introducing the subordinate clause, "Giulia" is the subject of the subordinate clause, "sia" is the third person singular present indicative of the verb "essere", which means "to be", "sempre" is an adverb meaning "always", "in viaggio" is a phrase that functions as an adjective meaning "traveling". Overall, it says that Andrea likes something about Giulia being always on the move or traveling.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The word "volontariamente" means "voluntarily," "affascina" means "fascinates" or "charms," and "Francesco" is a common male name in Italy. So, this sentence can be translated as "Emma voluntarily charms Francesco." Both subject-verb agreement and word order follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it can be translated as "Francesco wants him to come". The verb "venga" is the subjunctive form of "venire" (to come), which is used here because it follows the conjunction "che", introducing a dependent clause expressing a wish or desire from the subject of the main clause ("Francesco").
1	The sentence "Leonardo annota sul taccuino che il presidente scriverà la sua autobiografia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Leonardo takes notes in his notebook that the president will write his autobiography." Each word follows proper conjugations for its respective subject or object, and punctuation is used appropriately.
0	The sentence "Alessandro invita Paola a che si parta" is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. A more appropriate way to express the intended meaning (which seems to be something along the lines of "Alessandro asks Paola if we can leave") would be "Alessandro chiede a Paola se possiamo partire." In the original sentence, there's an issue with the use of "che si parta," which is ungrammatical as it stands. It could potentially work in certain dialectal forms or archaic language, but it doesn't fit here without additional context suggesting such usage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows the rules of that language's grammar. The subject "Alice" has accompanied "Tommaso" to "the movies," as indicated by "al cinema." Each word agrees with others in number (singular) and gender (feminine for "Alice," masculine for "Tommaso").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The departure brings a benefit to everyone." The word order, verb conjugation, and agreement between words all follow the rules of standard Italian grammar.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Alessandro is complaining about the dirty sea with Paola." The sentence follows proper subject-verb-object word order, uses correct verb tense (present indicative), gender agreement for the adjective ("sporco" agrees with "mare"), and includes appropriate prepositions and articles where necessary.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses a mixture of English (Alice) and Italian words (mette in agitazione), which does not form a valid sentence in either language. In addition, "mette" is the third person singular conjugation for the verb "mettere," so using it with a proper noun such as "Alice" would also be incorrect. A grammatically correct version could be "Alice upset Tommaso."
1	The sentence "Andrea lascia a Leonardo pieni poteri" seems grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Andrew leaves full powers to Leonard," which makes sense in English as well. There doesn't seem to be any grammatical errors such as subject-verb agreement issues, tense inconsistencies, or improper use of prepositions.
1	The sentence "Il piatto piange" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The dish cries" or more appropriately "The plate is empty" in English. In this case, "pianto" (to cry) is used figuratively to describe an empty dish.
1	The sentence "Mi girano le scatole" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I am getting annoyed" or "I have a headache" in English.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It's in the past tense and uses the reflexive verb "si è attaccata" (she attached herself) correctly with the direct object "un capello" (a hair). The sentence means "Alice attached herself to a hair." However, without additional context, it's difficult to say for certain if the meaning makes sense in context.
1	The sentence "Maria ha piantato Riccardo in asso" is grammatically correct and acceptable. It's an Italian sentence that literally means "Maria left Riccardo hanging." In English, we might say "Maria stood up Riccardo," but both sentences convey the same idea of abandoning someone at a critical moment.
1	The sentence "Sofia e Riccardo parlano la stessa lingua" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Sofia and Riccardo speak the same language." Each word follows proper grammar rules for Italian, including verb conjugations and noun genders. Additionally, the sentence structure is correct with subject ("Sofia e Riccardo"), verb ("parlano") and object ("la stessa lingua").
0	This sentence appears to be in Italian, with "Avere" meaning "to have" and "fegato" meaning "liver". However, there seems to be a subject missing for the verb "avere", making it grammatically incomplete or unclear at best. In proper usage of the language, one would say something along the lines of "Ho il fegato," which translates to "I have the liver."
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, but it is still ungrammatical or nonsensical even when considering that fact. The word "paturnie" does not exist in standard Italian; perhaps there's a typo and the author meant "paure", which means fears or worries. However, "avere le paure" remains an unusual way of expressing fear or worry in Italian. Usually one would say "aver paura di qualcosa" (to have fear of something) or simply "essere spaventato" / "esser preoccupato". So, without additional context, I cannot consider this sentence as being completely grammatical.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in Italian. "Avere" means "to have", while "sulle scatole" translates to "on the boxes". However, they do not form a proper sentence on their own as there's no subject or predicate indicating who has what. To make it grammatical, one could say something like "Io ho le scatole sopra il tavolo." which means "I have the boxes on the table."
0	The given sentence "Essere in un ventre di vacca" appears to be written in Italian, which translates to "to be in a cow's belly." While it might make sense syntactically within the context of that language, I am an English-speaking assistant and must evaluate the grammaticality based on standard English rules. When translated into English, the sentence becomes nonstandard due to its literal translation. Therefore, without considering any specific language other than English, the provided sentence is grammatically incorrect as per typical English conventions.
1	The sentence "Questa situazione ti ha messo nell'occhio del ciclone" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "This situation has put you in the eye of the storm" in English. All the words seem to agree with each other in terms of tense, number, and gender (if applicable). Additionally, there doesn't appear to be any missing or extra components that would make it ungrammatical.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Riccardo hopes he can leave soon" in English. The verb conjugations match with the subject, and all words are used correctly according to Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Beatrice ha un'attenzione per Giulia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Beatrice pays attention to Giulia" or "Beatrice has an attentiveness towards Giulia" in English. The use of article "un'" before the noun with a feminine gender ("attenzione") demonstrates proper agreement with the following word. Also, the verb "ha," which means "has," agrees with its subject "Beatrice" in number (singular) and person (third).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's written in Italian, not English. The sentence translates to "Alice is worried" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Siamo" means "we are", and "cariche di viveri" roughly translates to "stocked with supplies". Therefore, the entire sentence can be interpreted as "We are stocked with supplies." in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "The girl will eat the pizza." The subject-verb agreement is correct (la ragazza - feminine singular; mangerà - third person singular future tense), and the object of the sentence (la pizza) follows typical Italian syntax rules where direct objects come after the verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lei (she) presented the woman to his friends." The verb "ha presentato" agrees with the subject "Lei," and both the nouns "donna" and "amici" have their respective articles ("la" and "dei") that indicate grammatical gender and number agreement with adjectives or verbs. Therefore, it's a well-structured and coherent sentence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the indicative mood, simple present tense. The subject "Edoardo" is obeying (obbedisce) someone named "Sofia". Both names are proper nouns and capitalized as per Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Edoardo ci va" is grammatically correct in Italian, where it means something along the lines of "Edoardo goes there". This question does not provide any information about the specific grammatical rules or concepts that you want me to evaluate, so I will assume that you simply want to know whether the sentences are acceptable as written (in their respective languages).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Once he bought the swimsuit, Edoardo will go swimming." The verb tense used for "comprato" (bought) and "andrà" (will go) are consistent with each other and the subject-verb agreement is also correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Edoardo is going to invite Julia to dinner." The verb "va" agrees with the subject "Edoardo," and the indirect object "Giulia" followed by the preposition "a" before the infinitive verb "invitare" indicates that someone (Julia) will be invited to do something (have dinner).
0	The sentence "Beatrice le scappa a comprare" seems to be a mixture of Italian and Spanish words, which makes it ungrammatical in both languages. In Italian, "le" would typically indicate a direct object pronoun for feminine singular or plural objects, but its usage here doesn't make sense. Similarly, "scappa" means "escapes" in Italian and "buys" in Spanish, adding to the confusion. A proper translation might be something like "Beatrice se escapa para comprar" (Spanish) or "Beatrice scappa per comprare" (Italian).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "These are the books that Leonardo is putting on the shelves now." The verb "mettere" agrees with the subject "Leonardo" (third person singular), and all the endings of the words match correctly according to their gender and number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo puts the books on the shelves" in English. The verb "mettere" agrees with its subject "Edoardo", while "i libri" as direct object is correctly plural and masculine. Finally, "sugli scaffali" is properly placed after the verb for an indirect object location phrase.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "These are the books that Leonardo is putting on the shelves now." The verb "mettere" agrees with the subject "Leonardo" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the past participle "messi" agrees with the direct object "libri" also in number (plural) and gender (masculine). All other elements of the sentence agree as well.
0	The sentence "Andrea mangia" seems to be incomplete or written in a language other than English (it appears to be in Italian). A grammatical English sentence requires a subject and predicate; for example, "Andrea eats." would be an acceptable simple sentence in English with both a subject ("Andrea") and a predicate ("eats").
1	The sentence "Questo lavoro è di competenza di Leonardo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "This work falls under Leo's responsibility" or "This job is within Leo's jurisdiction." Therefore, there is no error in grammar, syntax, or word usage that I can identify.
1	The sentence "Questo lavoro rientra nelle competenze di Riccardo." appears to be in Italian and it follows proper grammatical rules for that language. In particular, the verb "rientrare" agrees with its subject "lavoro," and "nelle competenze" correctly modifies "rientrare." Additionally, the preposition "di" is used appropriately before the name "Riccardo." Therefore, I would say this sentence is grammatically correct.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The sentence "A Francesco piace Maria per le sue gambe" translates to "Francisco likes Maria for her legs." In English, we would say "Maria appeals to Francisco because of her legs," or simply "Francisco likes Maria for her legs." Regardless, both forms require adjustments to be grammatically correct in English.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. "Andrea accarezza le gambe di Maria" translates to "Andrew caresses Mary's legs" in English. The verb "accarezza" agrees with its subject "Andrea", and the possessive adjective "di Maria" correctly matches its noun "gambe". Therefore, if we consider this as an Italian sentence, it is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Riccardo did not appreciate that allusion." The grammar rules for word order, verb conjugations, and noun-adjective agreement are followed correctly.
1	The sentence "Francesco ricorda qualcosa" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Francesco remembers something" in English. Both the subject-verb agreement (Francesco-ricorda) and word order are correct.
1	The sentence "Era la conversazione che fecero i due ragazzi che Paola criticò" is grammatically correct in Italian. This is a complex sentence with two relative clauses modifying the noun "conversazione". Let's break it down: * "Era": Third-person singular indicative tense of the verb "essere", meaning "was." * "la conversazione": Direct object pronoun "la" (referring to the conversation) + feminine singular definite article "la." * "che": Relative pronoun introducing a relative clause that modifies "conversazione." * "fecero": Third-person plural preterit tense of the verb "fare," meaning "they made." * "i due ragazzi": Subject of the embedded clause "fecero i due ragazzi"; masculine plural definite article "i" + "due" = these two boys; "ragazzi" means boys. * "che": Another instance of the relative pronoun introducing another relative clause modifying "i due ragazzi." * "Paola criticò": Simple declarative sentence serving as an independent clause within the larger relative clause structure; third-person singular past tense of the verb "criticare," meaning "Paola criticized." So, putting everything together, we get: "[It] was the conversation that the two boys had whom Paola criticized." In English, this might seem awkward or unclear because the direct objects of both relative clauses ("conversation" and "two boys") appear at the beginning of their respective clauses. However, such structures are perfectly acceptable and commonplace in Italian.
1	The sentence "Leggeva i nomi degli artisti alla ragazza." appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated into English as "He was reading the names of artists to the girl.", where "he" refers to a male person who is performing the action (reading), "the names of artists" represents what he's reading, and "the girl" is the receiver of that information. Therefore, all elements seem to fit together correctly according to Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "Ha tradito la fiducia di Gabriele" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He betrayed Gabriele's trust." In this sentence, "ha" is an auxiliary verb used for compound tenses, "tradito" is the past participle of the verb "tradire" (to betray), "la" is a feminine singular definite article, "fiducia" means trust or confidence, and "di Gabriele" indicates possession, with "Gabriele" being a masculine proper name. All grammatical rules appear to be followed in terms of word order, agreement, and usage.
0	The sentence "Era felice di ciò." is not grammatically correct in English. However, it is grammatically correct in Italian, where it means "He/She was happy about that." Therefore, since the prompt asks for grammaticality in English, I have classified the sentence as incorrect.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows all the rules of Italian grammar. The subject "Era" (he was) agrees with the verb "contento" (happy), and the infinitive phrase "di giocare a carte" (to play cards) correctly uses the preposition "di" before the infinitive.
1	The sentence "Alessandro disgusts Giulia" is grammatically correct in English. However, you specified that the name is "Giulia", which suggests it's an Italian context. In that case, since I don't speak Italian fluently, I consulted a language source and found out that the sentence structure in Italian would be "Alessandro disturba Giulia". Nevertheless, without more information about the specific requirements or context of the exercise, I will assume that it can also accept foreign names and languages. Therefore, based on standard English grammar rules, the original sentence "Alessandro disgusts Giulia" is indeed grammatically correct as a simple statement with two proper noun subjects.
0	The given sentence "Ne vediamo di tutti i tipi" appears to be in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct sentence in English would have been something like "We see all kinds of them". Therefore, I cannot determine its grammaticality without translating it into English first.
0	The given sentence "Ha abboccato all'amo" appears to be written in Italian, but it contains grammatical errors that make it unacceptable in standard Italian. Specifically, "abboccato" should agree with its subject in gender and number; since the subject ("he") is masculine singular, "ha abboccato" (masculine singular form) would be appropriate. However, there seems to be an issue with the object of the verb - "all'amo". In Italian, definite articles change depending on gender and number as well, so "l'amo" might have been intended instead, which means "I love him", but without additional context or information about what was meant by the original author, it is difficult to determine their intention accurately. Therefore, I cannot categorize this sentence as grammatically correct.
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. The English translation of this sentence is "I laughed for two hours," which contains the grammatically correct phrase "for two hours." However, as it stands, the original sentence is not grammatically correct according to the rules of standard English grammar.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct, but it's in Italian, not English. The phrase "Ha preso una cotta per Sofia" translates to "He has taken a crush on Sophia" in English. If we were talking about English grammar only, I would need a sentence that is already in English. However, given that you asked for grammaticality in general, I am assuming you want me to consider grammaticality across languages as well. In that case, while the sentence is grammatically correct in Italian, an exact translation might not convey proper meaning or follow typical phrasing in English.
1	The sentence "Maria è in crisi" is grammatically correct. It follows the Subject-Verb-Complement (SVC) structure of Italian sentences with Maria as the subject, essere (to be) as the verb, and in crisi (in crisis) as the complement. Additionally, the word order is also appropriate for an SVC sentence structure in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "He/She was keeping control of the company" in English. The verb "conservava" agrees with the subject in number and tense, and the noun "il controllo" correctly takes on the definite article "il" because its first letter is a consonant. Additionally, the preposition "of" has been appropriately translated as "della", which shows possession between "controllo" and "società".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Maria sold her clothes at the flea market." The verb "ha venduto" agrees with the subject "Maria" in number (singular) and gender (feminine), and the object "i suoi vestiti" also agrees with its antecedent "Maria" in number (plural). Furthermore, the prepositional phrase "al mercato delle pulci" correctly uses the singular masculine definite article "il" before the noun "mercato", which takes the feminine singular form "delle" for the genitive plural of "pulci". All in all, the syntax and morphology of this sentence appear to be accurate.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it means "Paola faced the two books at the library." The verb "confrontare" agrees with its subject "Paola" in number (singular) and gender (feminine). The direct object pronoun "i" correctly refers to "due libri".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "Maria dipped her son in cold water" in English. The word order and grammar rules of Italian allow for sentences where the object (in this case, "il figlio", meaning "her son") comes before the verb (in this case, "ha immerso", meaning "dipped").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The English translation of this sentence would be "Leonardo was reading on the couch." In English, the verb "read" should agree with its subject in number (singular or plural) and tense (past, present, future). Here, the past tense form "leggeva" agrees with its singular subject "Leonardo". Also, the preposition "on" is used correctly before "the couch", making the original sentence grammatically correct in Italian.
1	The sentence "Il consenso della gente è nato dal suo talento" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of the sentence structure: * "Il consenso" (the consensus) is the subject. It agrees with the singular verb form "è." * "della gente" (of the people) tells us who the consensus belongs to. * "è nato" (was born) is the past participle used here as an auxiliary verb for passive voice or to indicate a state rather than an action. * "dal suo" (from his/her/its) indicates where the consensus comes from. * "talento" (talent) refers to what gives rise to the consensus. Overall, it's a complete and coherent sentence that follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it can be translated as "Francesco makes sure that everything goes well." The verb "guardare" (to watch, to look) agrees with its subject "Francesco," and the reflexive pronoun "che" introduces a subordinate clause. All elements of the sentence follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "Francesco is ashamed that it happened." The verb "si vergogna" agrees with its subject "Francesco," and "che sia successo" is correctly conjugated as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "Giulia has to work tomorrow" in English. The structure of the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules with the subject ("Giula") followed by the verb ("deve lavorare") and the time indicator ("domani").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it can be translated as "Francesco arranged Tommaso's departure with Maria." The verb "stabilire" agrees with its subject "Francesco", and each pronoun has an appropriate grammatical gender (Tommaso is masculine, Maria is feminine). All words are correctly inflected for tense and agreement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense and uses proper Italian grammar rules for verb conjugation based on the subject "Maria" (female singular). The object "il marito" (the husband) follows the standard possessive form. Therefore, there are no syntax or morphology errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He earns 500 euros renting that house" in English. The subject-verb agreement is correct (l'affitto, third person singular, agrees with rende), and the gender of the definite article l' matches the gender of the noun affitto.
0	The sentence "Hanno messo tutti in allarme?" appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammaticality judgment cannot be made without translating it first. However, even if translated into English, the sentence might still contain errors that would affect its grammaticality. For example, the translation of this sentence could be "Did they alarm everyone?", which seems to have an error since "alarm" as a verb requires a direct object in English (e.g., "Did they alarm everybody?" or "Did they set off the alarm?").
1	The sentence "Gli monta il sangue alla testa molto facilmente" is grammatically correct in Italian. This means that blood rises easily to his head or he gets angry very quickly. Each word is correctly spelled, there's no missing punctuation, and the grammar rules for subject-verb agreement and verb conjugations are followed properly given the context of the sentence.
1	The sentence "Per tutta la vita ha costruito castelli in aria." is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it translates to "He has been building castles in the air all his life" in English. Therefore, there is no grammatical mistake in this sentence.
0	This sentence is written in Italian, not English. The English translation of the sentence would be "What a profitable piece of land." However, even in its original language, the sentence is still ungrammatical because it lacks proper context and an appropriate question word (such as "quale" or "che") at the beginning for it to function as a standalone interrogative statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Gabriele had Lorenzo write a letter by Riccardo." Each word is correctly used, the verb conjugations match the subjects, and the syntax follows standard Italian rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. A direct translation to English would be "The wind had Andrea's glass break." In Italian, the past tense of reflexive verbs can sometimes have their subject appear after the verb (in this case, "da Andrea" refers to "il vetro," making it reflexive).
0	The sentence "Il colonello ha fatto la nave" in Italian translates to "The colonel made the ship." In English, it's not uncommon for someone to be credited with building or creating something new (e.g., "He built the house"). However, in this context, using "fatto" (made) doesn't fit well since we don't typically say that a colonel "makes" a ship in English. A more appropriate translation might involve verbs such as "constructed," "designed," or "commissioned." Nonetheless, based on the original input provided without any additional context, I have classified this sentence as grammatically incorrect because of the verb choice discrepancy between languages.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo had his glass window broken" in English. The verb "si è fatto" indicates that the subject received an action done by someone else or something else (passive voice), which is followed by the past participle of the verb "rompere", meaning "to break".
1	The sentence "Il sasso ha rotto il vetro" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The stone broke the glass" in English. Both the subject-verb agreement and word order are correct for an affirmative statement with simple past tense in Italian.
1	The sentence "L'auto ha schiacciato l'acceleratore" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The car stepped on the accelerator" in English. Each word seems to be used correctly according to standard Italian grammar rules, there are no spelling errors, and the verb conjugation matches the subject of the sentence (l'auto).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated to "The blow has crushed the accelerator" in English. The word order is correct, and all words agree with each other in terms of tense, number, and gender (if applicable).
1	The sentence "Lorenzo ha rotto il fidanzamento" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Lorenzo has broken off the engagement" in English. In this sentence, "ha" is an auxiliary verb used with the past participle "rotto", which agrees with its subject "Lorenzo". Furthermore, "il fidanzamento" means "the engagement," indicating that it's a specific one that was previously mentioned or understood from context. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The words "Il caldo" mean "the heat", "ha" is an auxiliary verb used for past tense, and "avariato" means "spoiled". So overall, it translates to "The heat has spoiled the food."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The moisture has rusted the iron" in English. The word order is correct, all words agree with each other in terms of grammatical number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine), and there are no obvious spelling errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense (passato prossimo) in Italian with "Gabriele" as the subject who performed an action on "il ferro". The verb "ha fatto" means "has made", but it can also be used for other actions that have been completed. In this case, "ossidare" means "to oxidize", so overall, the sentence says "Gabriele has oxidized the iron."
1	The sentence "Il vetro fu rotto dall'esplosione di un colpo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The glass was broken by the explosion of a shot." Each word follows standard Italian grammar rules for conjugations, tense agreement, and syntax.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct, but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence translates to "Maria washed herself" in English.
1	The sentence "Paola ha trascurato se stessa" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola has neglected herself." Each word in the sentence is correctly conjugated and inflected for its respective role within the sentence's structure.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The man who washed himself yesterday is my grandpa." The verb form "lavatosi" is a reflexive past participle that agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the subject "l'uomo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "Andrea" (third person singular) agrees with the verb "ha graffiato" (also third person singular), which means "scratched". "Lo sportello" refers to "the car door", while "dell'auto" is a genitive determiner that indicates possession. So overall, the sentence translates as "Andrea scratched the car door."
1	The sentence "Lo sportello dell'auto si è graffiato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The car door got scratched" in English. The word order is appropriate for an impersonal passive construction with "si", which is common in Romance languages such as Italian. Additionally, all of the words appear to be correctly spelled and used in their proper contexts, making it a syntactically valid statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Tommaso's face scratched itself." The verb "si è graffiato" agrees with the subject "il viso di Tommaso" (Tommaso's face) in gender (masculine) and number (singular).
0	The sentence "I prati si sono rivestiti con i fiori" appears to be written in Italian rather than English. A grammatically correct sentence in English would be something like "The meadows have covered themselves with flowers."
1	The sentence "I prezzi sono aumentati del 10 %" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence translates to "Prices have increased by 10%." In Italian, nouns and adjectives change depending on gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). Here, "prezzi," which means prices, is already in its proper masculine plural form. Also, the verb "sono aumentati," meaning have increased, agrees with the subject "i prezzi" both in tense (present perfect) and number (plural), as required by Italian grammar rules.

"L'intonaco" (the plaster) is the subject of the sentence, "si è sgretolato" (it crumbled) is the verb phrase in the passive voice, and "in poche settimane" (in just a few weeks) is an adverbial expression of time. Therefore, there do not appear to be any grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make the sentence unacceptable.

Each word in the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules, and there are no spelling errors or missing components. Therefore, it can be classified as a grammatically acceptable sentence.

0	The sentence "Il vino è diventato aceto per ore" is not grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "diventare" (to become) is used here with an improper time frame. In this context, it would be more appropriate to use "stare" which means to stay or remain. Also, we cannot say that something becomes another thing for hours; instead, we can state how long it took for the transformation to occur using "in". A corrected version of the sentence could be "Il vino è rimasto inacidito per diverse ore." meaning "The wine has remained souring for several hours."
1	The sentence "I commercianti hanno incrementato le vendite del 10 % per anni" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of the sentence: * I commercianti (the merchants) * hanno incrementato (have increased) * le vendite (the sales) * del 10% (by 10 percent) * per anni (for years).

The verb "si è cotta" agrees with its subject "la carne," both in gender (feminine) and number (singular). Also, the time expression "in 5 minuti" correctly indicates when the action occurred.
0	The Italian sentence "La finestra si è chiusa, ma non è chiusa" can be translated as "The window has closed, but it isn't closed." This is a contradiction because something cannot simultaneously have closed and not be closed. Therefore, this sentence is grammatically correct in terms of language use; however, its meaning is logically inconsistent.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The suitcase became light." The verb "è diventata" agrees with the gender (feminine) and number (singular) of the subject "la valigia".

1	The sentence "La carne è saporita" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The meat is tasty" in English. In Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, as demonstrated in this sentence (saporita, meaning tasty, comes after carne, meaning meat).
0	The sentence "Il vino è aceto." is not grammatically correct in the context of English language. However, it would be correct in Italian where it means "The wine is vinegar.", which seems to be an unintended mistake since you asked for grammatical correction in English sentences.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence means "The wool sweater has felted" in English.
1	The sentence "Edoardo si è fatto simile a uno scheletro" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated into English as "Edoardo has made himself similar to a skeleton." It uses the reflexive verb "si è fatto," which means "has made oneself" or "has become," followed by an adjective "simile" that agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the subject "Edoardo." Additionally, it includes the preposition "a" before the noun phrase "uno scheletro," indicating comparison. Overall, all elements within this sentence work together well to convey its intended meaning.
1	The sentence "La carne è diventata gustosa" is in Italian and it translates to "The meat has become tasty".

1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'aria" means "the air", "si è fatta" is the passive form of the verb "fare" (to become) conjugated for third person singular feminine gender, which agrees with "l'aria". Finally, "puzzolente" is an adjective that describes something as having a strong unpleasant smell. So the whole sentence can be translated into English as "The air has become smelly."
1	The sentence "La situazione diventa ingarbugliatissima" is in Italian and it translates to "The situation becomes very confusing" in English. This sentence is grammatically correct as per Italian language rules. In Italian, adjectives often follow the noun they modify, which is why "ingarbugliatissima" (very confused) comes after "situazione" (situation). Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
0	The given sentence "A Riccardo, questi argomenti non l'hanno convinto" seems to be written in Italian but lacks proper grammar. In Italian, subject pronouns (like "he", "she", or "they") are usually dropped because the verb form itself indicates the subject. However, when an object pronoun comes before a verb, it must be linked with the verb using a clitic (a type of unstressed pronoun). So, for the sentence to be grammatically correct, we need to add "-lo" as a clitic to link "questi argomenti" (these topics) with "non hanno convinto" (did not convince): "A Riccardo, non li hanno convinti."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Madness scares Francesco" in English. The word order follows standard Italian grammar rules with the subject ("la follia") coming before the verb ("spaventa"). Additionally, all words used are correctly conjugated for tense and agreement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le ragazze" means "the girls", "hanno innervosito" is the third person plural of the present perfect tense of the verb "innervosire" which means "to make someone nervous or anxious". Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "The girls have made Andrea nervous."

1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Those fires have irritated / nervoused Edoardo." The verb "innervosire" agrees with its subject "Quei fuochi" (those fires) in number (plural), gender (masculine), and person (third). Additionally, the object "Edoardo" follows the correct agreement rules for Italian language.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of the structure: - "Alice" (subject) - "ha fatto" (third person singular indicative present tense of "fare," meaning "has made") - "calmare" (infinitive form of "calmare," which means "to calm down") - "Andrea" (direct object) - "a quell'uomo" (indirect object introduced by "a", indicating movement or direction; it can be translated as "to that man"). So the overall translation would be something along the lines of "Alice has calmed Andrea down towards that man."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Maria made Gabriele worry about his girlfriend" in English. The verb "fare" (to make) is correctly conjugated for third person singular feminine ("ha fatto"), and the reflexive pronoun "si" before "preoccupare" is also used correctly. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Maria ha fatto irritare Leonardo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Mary made Leonard angry". Here's the breakdown of the sentence: - "Maria" is the subject of the sentence, which means that she is performing the action. - "ha fatto" is an auxiliary verb used for compound tenses (passato prossimo) in Italian. In English, it would translate to "has done", but here, it helps form the present perfect tense. - "irritare" is a transitive verb meaning "to annoy" or "to make someone angry". - "Leonardo" is the direct object of the sentence, receiving the action from the verb.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatical English translation of what you're trying to say would be "Riccardo beguiles himself," which is grammatically correct but may not convey the intended meaning due to cultural differences or context.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo si è piaciuto per ciò." is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Lorenzo" is a proper noun referring to a male individual, so it agrees with the masculine gender. * "si è piaciuto" is an impersonal reflexive verb form that means "he liked himself," which is used when the subject of the liking action is not explicitly stated but implied to be the same as the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is Lorenzo. * "per ciò" is a phrase meaning "for that reason" or "therefore," indicating a causal relationship between the previous context and the current statement. It shows that something has caused Lorenzo to like himself, although the exact cause is not specified in the sentence itself. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable and meaningful in Italian, even though it may seem uncommon or humorous to English speakers due to its self-referential nature.
1	The sentence "Edoardo si è spaventato a quella notizia" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated into English as "Edoardo got scared at that news", where each word has its corresponding translation: Edoardo (subject), si è spaventato (verb + past participle for reflexive verbs) and a quella notizia (at that news). Reflexive verbs indicate an action performed by the subject on itself; in this case, Edoardo is performing the action of getting scared upon himself.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Riccardo got excited about that news." The verb "si è agitato" agrees with its subject "Riccardo" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the adjective "quella" agrees with its noun "notizia" in gender (feminine) and number (singular). All the words are correctly conjugated and inflected according to their grammatical function in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Tommaso got excited about that news." The verb "si è agitato" agrees with the subject "Tommaso" in gender (male) and number (singular), and the preposition "per" followed by the article "quella" indicates the reason for his excitement. All elements of the sentence are correctly used and placed.
1	The sentence "Riccardo è irritato di quella notizia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Riccardo is annoyed at that news" in English. This sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object structure of an Italian sentence, where "Riccardo" is the subject, "è irritato" (is annoyed) is the verb phrase, and "quella notizia" (that news) is the object. Therefore, it's grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The fact that taxes will decrease fools citizens." The verb conjugations match their subjects (il fatto, le tasse, and i cittadini), and the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	The sentence "Maria ha timore di ciò" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence can be translated to English as "Maria is afraid of that." In Italian, "ha" is an auxiliary verb used with past participle forms of certain verbs, while "timore" means fear or fright, "di" indicates about or of, and "ciò" refers to that (as a pronoun). Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Ciò fa terrore a Maria" appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct version of this sentence in English would be "That frightens Mary."
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The word "si" means "himself/herself/itself/yourself", etc., depending on the context, but it does not belong in this sentence because there's no corresponding verb or pronoun for it to refer back to. A more appropriate translation of "Emma feels nervous" into Italian would be "Emma è nervosa".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows standard Italian syntax rules with a subject ("Sofia"), verb ("è"), and object ("l'accaduto"). The endings of the words also align with their grammatical roles (e.g., "Sofia" being singular feminine).
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian and not English. The phrase "Sofia ha i nervi a fior di pelle" translates to "Sophie has nerves on the surface of her skin" in English. Therefore, it's grammatically incorrect as an English sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it translates to "Emma is amazed" or "Emma is astonished". The subject-verb agreement is correct (Emma - singular, is in stupore - third person singular), and the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it means "Paola is in a state of fear." The grammar structure, verb conjugation, and word usage are all appropriate for the context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "What words have offended Francesco?" The grammar structure, word choice, and spelling are all appropriate for the language.
0	The sentence contains some spelling errors and word usage issues. It seems that "horror" was intended to be a noun (a genre of films), but it's being used as an adjective in this context. Also, "appassionano" does not seem to be a proper Italian word; perhaps you meant "appassionato," which means passionate. A corrected version could be: "I filmo horrror movie con passione, come Andrea." However, without additional context or clarification on what exactly you want to express with the given phrase, it's difficult for me to provide a more precise correction.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "The explosion shattered the glass." The verb "ha frantumato" agrees with its subject "l'esplosione" and the object "il vetro" follows the right order after the verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "quella pietanza" (that dish) agrees with the verb "ha nauseato" (has made sick), and both agree with the object pronoun "Francesco". Additionally, it follows proper word order for an affirmative statement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "My mother's health condition worried me right away." The verb "ha preoccupato" agrees with its subject "lo stato" (singular, masculine) and the adjective "suo" agrees with its noun "mamma" (feminine singular). All other elements of the sentence also align correctly, making it a grammatically sound statement in Italian.
1	The sentence "Lo stato di salute di mia madre mi ha addolorato in pochi minuti" appears to be grammatically correct and acceptable. It's written in Italian and can be translated as "My mother's health status saddened me in just a few minutes." Each word seems to be used correctly, there are no apparent spelling errors, and the grammatical structure of the sentence follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "fumare" (to smoke) agrees with its past participle form "fumo", and it's correctly conjugated for third person singular masculine or feminine ("ha irritato"). Also, the preposition "di" connects possessive relationship between "Paola" and her throat ("gola") which has been affected by smoking.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "ha" (which means "has") agrees with its subject "Beatrice" in number and gender. Also, the past participle "irritato", which agrees with its direct object "Francesco" in gender and number, correctly follows the auxiliary verb. So, overall, the sentence has a proper structure without any grammatical mistakes or awkward phrasing.

Each word follows proper conjugation rules for its respective tense, voice, and mood based on subject-verb agreement, which shows good grammatical structure.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The sentence consists of two words: "L'intonaco" (the plaster) and "si è sgretolato" (has crumbled), both of which are correctly conjugated for the past tense. Therefore, without additional context or information about what aspect of grammar you might be considering, I have labeled it as grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "The EU policy has crushed Greece." The grammar structure, verb conjugation, word choice, and agreement between words all follow standard Italian language rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense (passato prossimo) in Italian with regular -are verbs ("spento" is the first person singular of "spegnere", which means "to turn off"). The subject is "Giulia" and she is doing the action on the object "le polemiche" (the controversies).
1	The sentence "La schiena si è scottata." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The back has gotten sunburned" or "My back got burnt (by the sun)" in English.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. The verb "si è rotto" means "has broken," but it requires a direct object to indicate what has broken. In addition, proper nouns such as names of people (in this case, "Maria") need to be capitalized in Italian. A possible correction could be "Gabriele si è rotto il braccio di Maria," meaning "Gabriele broke his arm because of Maria."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows all of the rules for Italian grammar. The subject "Riccardo" is followed by the verb "è" (which means "is") and the adjective "desideroso" (which means "eager"). The phrase "di partire" (which means "to leave") functions as an infinitive complement of the adjective "desideroso". So, the entire sentence translates to "Riccardo is eager to leave."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "Giulia" is followed by a verb in its third person singular form ("sposta"), indicating that it agrees with the gender (feminine) and number (singular) of the subject. Additionally, the objects "il cadavere", "l'armadio", and "al tavolo" all appear to follow standard Italian grammar rules for nouns and articles. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows the rules of Italian grammar. The subject "Francesco" is followed by the verb "va" (which means "goes") in the third person singular present indicative form, which agrees with the subject. Then we have the article "a" before "scuola", which is also grammatically correct. So, despite being in a different language, the sentence structure is perfectly valid.
1	The sentence "Gabriele è alla scuola svizzera" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele is at the Swiss school." In this sentence, "è" is an auxiliary verb used with the present tense of the verb "essere" (to be), which agrees with the subject "Gabriele". Moreover, "alla" is a contraction of "a" (at) and "la" (the feminine singular definite article). Finally, "scuola svizzera" refers to a Swiss school. Overall, all words are correctly conjugated or spelled, making it a grammatical sentence.
1	The sentence "Gabriele è alla tavola" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Gabriele is at the table" in English.

1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Giulia takes Gabriele to the table." The verb "accompagna" agrees with the subject "Giulia," and both the subject and the indirect object ("Gabriele") agree in number (singular) and gender (feminine/masculine). The preposition "in" followed by "tavola" correctly indicates where the action is happening.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The translation of "Maria falls to the ground" in English would be "Maria falls to the floor."
1	The sentence "Andrea ha iscritto il figlio a scuola di danza" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea enrolled his son in dance school." Each word follows proper grammar rules for verb conjugations, article usage, and word order. Therefore, I would say that it's an acceptable sentence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Emma brought the package to school" in English. The verb "ha portato" agrees with the subject "Emma", and the direct object "il pacco" also follows proper grammatical rules for masculine singular nouns. Additionally, the preposition "a" before "scuola" indicates movement towards or location at the destination, which fits the context of bringing something there.
1	The sentence "Francesco sta in poltrona" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Francesco is on the armchair" or "Francesco is in the armchair" in English. However, without more context, it's unclear which translation would be most appropriate. Nonetheless, the grammar of the original Italian sentence is correct.
0	The sentence "La palla è finita didietro" seems to be written in Italian, but it contains an error. The word "didietro," which appears to be an improper combination of "di" (of) and "dietro" (behind), is not a valid way to express "behind" in Italian. A more appropriate phrase would be "la palla è finita dietro."
1	The sentence "La palla è finita in acqua" is grammatically correct and acceptable. It's written in Italian and it translates to "The ball ended up in the water." All of its elements agree with each other (gender, number), word order is also appropriate for a simple declarative statement, so there are no apparent grammatical errors in this sentence.

The structure of the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules with the subject ("Mi", which refers to the speaker), verb ("raccomendo"), and object ("acqua").

1	The sentence "Riccardo avrebbe bruciato le tappe" is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Riccardo would have accelerated/made quick progress". Each word is correctly inflected according to its role in the sentence, both from a morphological and syntactic point of view. Thus, it does not present any grammatical issues and is acceptable in formal writing or speech.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's what it means: "Maria suddenly stole Gabriele's heart." The verb "ha rubato" indicates that the action happened in the past tense with Maria as the subject.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in English. The sentence appears to be written in Italian, with "Emma" as the subject, "se la" being unclear and possibly incorrect, and "passava bene" meaning something along the lines of "was passing well." However, since you asked for grammatical correctness in English specifically, I have marked it as incorrect. If you were asking about Italian sentences, please let me know!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Giulia looked at Lorenzo." The verb "mise" agrees with the subject "Giulia", which is feminine singular, and the preposition "addosso" indicates that the action of looking was directed towards someone or something ("Lorenzo").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Riccardo left the suit on the couch." The grammar structure of the sentence follows standard Italian syntax rules with a proper subject ("Riccardo"), verb ("abbandonò") and object ("l'abito"). Additionally, the word order and use of prepositions are also appropriate for the language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it appears to be in Italian rather than English. The verb "inchinò" means "bowed" or "bent" in English, so a possible translation of this sentence into English could be "Maria bowed her head."
0	The verb "piegare" in Italian means "to bend." However, it requires an object pronoun when used reflexively (meaning the subject performs the action on itself), so the correct form of the sentence would be "Alice si è chinata," which translates to "Alice bent down."
1	The sentence "Maria levò il capo" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Maria lifted her head" or "Maria raised her head". Here's what each part of the sentence means: - Maria: A female name - levò: Past tense of "levere", which means to lift or raise (in this context, it refers to raising one's head) - il capo: Direct object, referring to the head So, unless there's more context that would make the sentence ungrammatical, I believe the given sentence is acceptable.
0	The sentence "Maria rizzò il capo" appears to contain an error in its verb conjugation for the past tense. In standard Italian, "rizzare" would become "risse" when used with a feminine singular subject such as "Maria." Additionally, "il capo," which translates to "the head," does not seem appropriate based on context; it may be intended as "capello" (hair). Thus, the corrected version could read, "Maria rise il capello."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele took the car." The verb form "prese" agrees with the subject "Gabriele," which is in the third person singular past tense (passato prossimo). Additionally, "l'auto" is correctly used as the direct object of the sentence, indicating that something was taken.
1	The sentence "Alessandro prese la trombosi" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Alessandro had a thrombosis (or phlebitis)" in English. However, it might sound odd without additional context since having a medical condition isn't typically expressed as taking or seizing something in everyday conversation. Nonetheless, there are no grammatical errors in the given Italian sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La trombosi" (the thrombosis) is the subject of the sentence, and "venne ad Edoardo" (came to Edward) is the verb phrase with "Edoardo" as its indirect object. The word order follows typical Italian syntax rules for simple sentences, making it an acceptable construction.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "venne" (came) agrees with its subject "il tifo" (the cheer or support), while "a Riccardo" indicates that the support came to Riccardo.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo warmed up." The verb "si scaldare" (to warm up) agrees with its subject "Leonardo," which is in third person singular form, so the past tense of the verb also takes the -ò ending, as expected for regular verbs in that conjugation category.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence "Maria si riposò" translates to "Maria rested" in English.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct English translation of this sentence would be "Alice got stronger."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Paola and Francesco got started." The sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules with two subjects (Paola and Francesco) taking the third person plural verb form "presero" which matches their feminine and masculine genders respectively.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ebbe una sbornia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Riccardo had a hangover" in English. Each word is spelled correctly and it follows proper syntactical rules for the language. Therefore, I would classify this as a grammatically correct sentence.
1	The sentence "Il formaggio fece la muffa" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The cheese got moldy" or "The cheese made mold" in English. In Italian, both "fecero" (third-person plural past tense of fare) and "fece" (third-person singular past tense of fare) can be translated as "made," depending on the context. Here, it's clear from the subject ("il formaggio") that we need the third-person singular form, so "fece" is appropriate.
0	The sentence "Sofia ebbe un bagno" seems to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct English version of this sentence could be "Sophia took a bath."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It seems to follow the standard subject-verb-object word order in Italian. The verb "si maritò" (she married) agrees with its subject "Beatrice." Also, the preposition "con" followed by the object "Gabriele" indicates that Beatrice married Gabriele, which makes sense as they're both proper nouns referring to people who can enter into marriage.
1	The sentence "Riccardo respirò aria fresca" is grammatically correct. It's an Italian sentence that means "Riccardo breathed fresh air." Each word in the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules, and the sentence structure is also accurate for the language.
0	The sentence "Giulia prese una dritta" appears to be written in Italian, not English. Therefore, it cannot be evaluated for grammaticality in English. If this were an English sentence, I would need more context to determine its grammaticality as "dritta" is not a commonly used word in English.
1	The sentence "Giulia si sbagliò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia was wrong." The subject of the sentence is "Giulia," which is in the third person singular feminine form, and it agrees with the past tense verb "sbagliò," also in the third person singular feminine form. Therefore, there is no grammatical error in the sentence.
0	The sentence "L'aereo approdarono" is in Italian, but it appears that you intended for me to evaluate its grammaticality in English. In English, the equivalent sentence would be "The plane landed." However, the provided Italian sentence is not grammatically correct because "approdare" is an intransitive verb which cannot take an object, so using the plural form ("approdarono") with a singular subject ("l'aereo") is incorrect. A proper example of its usage could be "Il battello approdò al porto," meaning "The boat docked at the harbor."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct, but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence translates to "Alessandro bathed" or "Alessandro got wet" in English.
1	The sentence "Tommaso arieggiò la sua stanza" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso aired out his room." Each word is spelled correctly, and it follows standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure. Furthermore, there are no missing or extra words that would make the sentence unclear. Therefore, I would say that this sentence is grammatically acceptable for an Italian speaker to use.
1	The sentence "La nave ammarò" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard structure of an indicative past tense sentence with a feminine singular subject ("la nave", meaning "the ship") and the verb "ammarrare" (meaning "to beach or moor"). In addition, there's no apparent spelling mistake in the given sentence.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated to "Tommaso took the earth from the bucket" in English. The verb form "prese" agrees with the subject "Tommaso", which is in third person singular past tense. Additionally, both "la terra" (the direct object) and "dal secchio" (from the bucket), agree with the gender and number of their respective objects and subjects.
0	The sentence "I marinai vogavano" appears to be written in Italian, not English. In addition, it is grammatically incorrect even in Italian as it lacks proper subject-verb agreement. A more accurate translation of "The sailors were sailing" into Italian would be "I marinai navigavano."
1	The sentence "Il dollaro è salito" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The dollar has risen" in English. The words used are correctly spelled, and they follow proper grammatical rules for word order, verb conjugation, and subject-verb agreement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "The project was successful." The verb "ebbe" is the singular, third person, past tense of "avere" (to have), which agrees with the subject "il progetto". The word order is also correct for an affirmative statement in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Lorenzo put on a hat." The verb "prese" agrees with the subject "Lorenzo" in number (both singular) and gender (both masculine), and "cappellaccio" is a valid word in Italian that refers to a type of hat.
1	The sentence "Riccardo si imbronciò" is grammatically correct, but its grammaticality depends on the language being considered. This sentence appears to be in Italian, as it uses the third-person singular masculine past tense of the verb "imbronciare," which means "to frown." In English, the equivalent would be "Riccardo frowned," which is also grammatically correct. Therefore, I am assuming that you intended for me to evaluate the grammaticality based on standard Italian usage, where this sentence is indeed acceptable.
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. The correct English translation would be "Andrea took a hat." or "Andrea picked up a hat.", depending on context.
0	The sentence "Paola prese corpo" seems to be written in Italian, but it appears that there might be a mistake because it does not make sense as it stands. A more accurate Italian sentence could be "Paola prese il corpo," which translates to "Paola picked up the body." Therefore, I assume that the provided sentence was intended to convey a different meaning or contains an error.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Alessandro took part in the party". The verb "prese" agrees with the subject "Alessandro" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the phrase "alla festa" correctly uses the singular definite article "la" before the feminine noun "festa", indicating that it refers to one specific party.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the past tense (Francesco "annotò" - annotated) and it follows the Subject-Verb-Object structure of simple sentences in Italian. The subject ("Francesco") is doing the action denoted by the verb ("annotò"), which is acting on the object ("la lezione" - the lesson).
1	The sentence "Leonardo prese imbarco sulla nave" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo boarded the ship." Each word is spelled correctly, there's proper agreement between words (such as subject-verb), and overall it follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Paola got information about Alessandro." The verb "prese" agrees with the subject "Paola" in number (singular) and gender (feminine), and the object "informazioni" correctly uses the plural form.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Edoardo fell in love with Sofia." The sentence follows standard Italian syntax rules, where the subject (Edoardo) comes before the verb (si innamorò), and the object of the sentence (Sofia) comes after the verb. Additionally, each word is properly conjugated for tense and person.
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. The English translation would be "Paola took a hatred for Tommaso," which is also grammatically incorrect in English due to the use of "a" before "hatred." A proper English version could be "Paola developed a hatred toward Tommaso" or "Paola grew to hate Tommaso."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The birds fed themselves from their mother." in English. The verb "si imbeccarono" agrees with its subject "gli uccelli," which is plural, and it also follows the standard word order for an affirmative declarative sentence (subject + verb). Additionally, there's no apparent grammatical error or awkward phrasing that would make the sentence unacceptable in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It appears to be in Italian, not English. The sentence translates to "Maria took a crush on Francesco" in English. In Italian, "prendere una cottura per qualcuno" is an idiomatic expression that means to develop romantic feelings for someone. Each word in the sentence is correctly spelled and used in proper context according to Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The sentence translates to "Maria took Lorenzo's game" in English. "Si prese" is the reflexive form of "prendere" (to take), used here because the subject ("Maria") is performing an action on something that belongs to someone else ("il gioco", or "the game"). "Il gioco di Lorenzo" means "Lorenzo's game". Therefore, the structure of the sentence is consistent with standard Italian grammar rules, making it acceptable.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo è il primo nella gara" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Lorenzo is first in the race", which follows proper grammar rules for word order, subject-verb agreement, and definite article usage in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Francesco took the knife by the blade" in English. The verb "prese" agrees with its subject "Francesco", which is in third person singular masculine form (he). Similarly, the definite article "il" matches with the noun "coltello". Additionally, the preposition "per" followed by "la lama" correctly indicates that Francesco grabbed the knife using the blade as support or tool. Therefore, I can confirm that the given sentence is grammatically correct in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Leonardo made his own damage." The verb "fece" (third person singular of "fare", meaning "to make") agrees with its subject "Leonardo". The adjective "proprio" modifies the noun "danno" correctly through agreement on gender (masculine) and number (singular).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the present perfect tense (Lorenzo has taken) of the Italian language, and it literally means "Lorenzo took fiascos for flutes". However, its actual meaning would depend on context as idioms don't translate directly between languages.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria had a session of heliotherapy." Each word seems to be used correctly and there are no obvious spelling or grammar mistakes.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian language. "Andrea" is the subject, "prese" is the verb meaning "took", and "il treno" is the object which means "the train".
1	The sentence "È stato perso troppo spesso il treno, in questa redazione" is grammatically correct. Here's why: - "È stato perso" is the passive form of the verb "perdere", which means "to lose". In this case, it indicates that something (the train) has been lost repeatedly. - "Troppo spesso" means "too often". It modifies the verb phrase "è stato perso" indicating how many times the action occurred. - "Il treno" refers to the train, which is the subject being discussed. - "In questa redazione" means "in this newsroom" or "at this editorial office". It specifies where the loss of the train took place. Therefore, the entire sentence can be translated as "The train has been lost too many times, at this newsroom."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "la bussola" (the compass) is feminine singular, so the past participle "persa" must agree with it in gender and number. Both "fu" and "da" are correctly used as auxiliary verb for passive voice and preposition respectively.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It uses the negated form of the reflexive verb "controllare" (to control) with the subject pronoun "Andrea". The phrase "non si controllò più" can be translated as "Andrea couldn't help himself anymore."
1	The sentence "Edoardo è un chimico" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo is a chemist." In Italian, subject pronouns (such as "Edoardo") are often omitted because the verb ending already indicates the subject. Therefore, even though it might seem strange to an English speaker to omit the subject, it's perfectly normal in Italian.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence "Tommaso mise giudizio" translates to "Tommaso passed judgment" in English, which is also grammatically correct.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A correct English translation of the sentence would be "Lorenzo told two to Maria," which is clearly ungrammatical. The intended meaning may have been something like "Lorenzo said two words to Maria" or "Lorenzo told Maria two things."
0	The given sentence "Beatrice prese fischi per fiaschi" is in Italian, while I am only able to assess English grammar. My apologies for any confusion caused by the example provided in another language. In general, it's important to ensure that examples used in questions or statements align with the context expected by the AI model.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. The English translation of this sentence is "Tommaso throws oil on the fire." If we evaluate the grammar based on English language rules, the sentence would contain several errors (incorrect verb tense agreement between subject and verb, missing article before "fire"). Therefore, I assume that you intended for me to check the grammaticality according to Italian language rules. While there may still be minor stylistic or idiomatic issues with the original sentence, overall it seems mostly acceptable as far as basic grammar goes. However, since it was presented to me in a language other than English, my assessment must be that it is grammatically incorrect from an English perspective.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It follows standard Italian sentence structure (Subject-verb-object) with proper verb conjugation for past tense ("tirò") and definite articles where appropriate. Additionally, "Riccardo" agrees in gender and number with its corresponding pronoun later in the sentence. The phrase itself translates to "Riccardo threw water on his own mill," which is semantically sound as well.
1	The sentence "Alessandro si diede la zappa sui piedi" is grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. In English, the equivalent would be something like "Alessandro shot himself in the foot." Both sentences use an idiomatic expression to convey that someone did something self-defeating or foolish.
1	The sentence "Emma ascolta un disco" is grammatically correct. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in Italian, where "Emma" is the subject, "ascolta" is the verb, and "un disco" is the object. Additionally, the words themselves are all spelled and used correctly in this context.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It is in the past tense (Riccardo "ha" toccato), and it follows the typical Subject-Verb-Object word order of standard Italian. The verb "toccato" means "touched," so the translation would be something like "Riccardo touched Emma." Without additional context or information about the intended meaning of the sentence, I can't say for sure whether it makes sense in context, but based solely on grammar and syntax, it seems fine.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Riccardo does the translations of war bulletins." The verb "fa" (does) agrees with the subject "Riccardo", and the object "le traduzioni" (the translations) follows the standard rules for Italian grammar.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct for standard English. The word "Di" does not exist in English grammar, and it seems that you intended to use a form of the verb "to drive," which would require an infinitive or past tense verb form such as "drive" or "drove." Additionally, "maniera beffarda" appears to be Italian, so unless you're writing code that deals with multiple languages simultaneously, I assume we want to evaluate based on English language rules only.
0	The sentence "Tommaso legge" is not grammatically complete in English or Italian (assuming that Tommaso is a person's name). It lacks proper context and subject-verb agreement. A more appropriate sentence could be "Tommaso legge un libro," which means "Tommaso reads a book" in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the present tense, indicative mood, third person singular (Gabriele), from the Italian verb "fare" which means "to do/make." The phrase "fa una telefonata" translates as "makes a phone call," while "a Maria" indicates that she is making the phone call to Maria.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows proper Italian grammar rules for verb conjugation (Tommaso "dà" = gives), noun gender (un libro = masculine singular book), and article usage (a Maria = to Maria).
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. The question asks for grammaticality judgment on an English sentence. Therefore, I cannot evaluate its grammaticality based on my programming. However, even if it were in English, there would still be issues with the sentence's syntax and semantics. Specifically, "Che Andrea have telephoned has caused..." is ungrammatical due to case disagreement between "che" (which requires a subjunctive verb form) and "have telephoned" (an indicative verb form). Additionally, the logical relationship between events expressed by these two clauses needs clarification for proper interpretation of their temporal order and causality.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "Riccardo calls Emma" in English. The word order is subject-verb-indirect object, which is typical for Italian sentences with two objects.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian, not English, but it follows proper Italian grammar rules for word order, subject-verb agreement, and tense usage. The subject "Emma" is followed by the verb "è" (third person singular of essere or "to be") which agrees with the subject in number and gender. The adjective "angoscia" also correctly matches the gender and number of the subject. Therefore, there are no syntactic errors in this sentence that would make it unacceptable in standard Italian.
1	The sentence "Leonardo odia Maria" is grammatically correct. It follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in Spanish, where "Leonardo" is the subject, "odia" is the verb, and "Maria" is the object. Additionally, all words are correctly spelled and used appropriately for the context.
0	The sentence "Leonardo odia Paola?" is written in Italian, not English. In English, it would be "Does Leonardo hate Paola?" or "Leonardo hates Paola," depending on context. Therefore, I assume you're asking about its grammaticality in English.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Alessandro went to greet his father" in English. The subject-verb agreement is correct (Alessandro - andò), and the object follows the appropriate pattern with the definite article ("il") before "padre".
1	The sentence "Alessandro girò, con l'auto, a raccoglierla" is grammatically correct in Italian. Here is a breakdown of the sentence: - Alessandro: This is the subject of the sentence, referring to a male named Alessandro. - girò: This is the verb of the sentence, which means "turned". In this case, it is in past tense (giró). - con l'auto: This is an adverbial phrase that indicates how or by what means Alessandro turned. It means "with the car." - a raccoglierla: This is another adverbial phrase indicating where Alessandro went after turning. It means "to pick her up," with "her" being the object of the action. So, overall, the sentence can be translated as "Alessandro turned with his car to pick her up."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It is in Italian and translates to "The boat turned to save them" in English. The word order is correct and all words seem to be used appropriately in their given context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is the subject of the sentence, "obbedisce" means "obeys", "a" is a preposition that can be translated as "to", and "lui" is a pronoun meaning "him". Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "Andrea always obeys him." The grammatical structure and word choices are all appropriate for standard Italian language use.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it translates to "The soldiers have handed over the weapons to the prisoners" in English. The verb "hanno passato" agrees with its subject "i soldati" in number (plural) and gender (masculine). The objects "le armi" and "ai prigionieri" also agree in number and gender with their respective implied verbs.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is a name of an individual, while "ama" means "loves", and "i bignè" refers to "the cream puffs". Therefore, when translated directly into English, it would mean "Alessandro loves the cream puffs."
1	The sentence "Il cedro ama la libertà." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The cedar tree loves freedom" in English. In this sentence, "il cedro" (the cedar tree) is the subject, "ama" (loves) is the verb, and "la libertà" (freedom) is the object. All of these elements agree with each other in number and gender, making it a grammatically correct sentence.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect. The word "potato" in English means "to dig or excavate with a tool", but it seems that the intended meaning here is "the gardener has bathed/washed the poodle of Edward". In Italian, the verb for bathing an animal is "fare il bagno a", so a possible correct translation would be "Il giardiniere ha fatto il bagno al barboncino di Edoardo."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. The sentence can be translated to "Alessandro left Lorenzo a rich inheritance" in English. It follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of an SVO language, with proper agreement between the subjects and verbs.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Alessandro drinks his coffee." The verb "beve" agrees with the subject "Alessandro" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and "il suo caffè" is correctly used as a possessive phrase.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject, "desidera" is the verb, and "rivedere Beatrice" is the object of the sentence. Additionally, all words used are correctly spelled and inflected for tense and number according to their role within the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "A yellow-eyed cat is under the arch of the door." The word order, verb conjugations, and agreement all follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the present tense of the indicative mood in Italian language. "Paola" is the subject, "ha" is an auxiliary verb that means "has", and "coraggio" is a noun meaning "courage". So, the sentence can be translated as "Paola has courage" in English.
1	The sentence "Gabriele segue una rigida condotta morale" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Gabriele follows a strict moral conduct" in English. All of the words used here are correctly spelled and conjugated according to their roles in the sentence. Additionally, the sentence structure adheres to standard Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence "La zanzara pratica una rigida condotta morale" is in Italian and it means "The mosquito follows a strict moral conduct". Since I am assessing grammatical correctness and not language identification or translation, I will focus on the structure of the sentence. This sentence appears to be grammatically correct because it has a subject ("la zanzara"), an adverb ("una rigida"), a verb in its third person singular form that agrees with the subject ("pratica"), and a complement ("conduitta morale") which is linked to the subject by the preposition "di", all following standard Italian syntax rules.
0	The sentence "Il frigorifero ha una forte cotta per Francesco" is in Italian, not English. Therefore, it's grammatically incorrect as an English statement. In Italian, it means "The refrigerator has a strong crush on Francesco," which is grammatically correct in that language but not relevant to the task at hand.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct, but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence translates to "Tommaso gave slaps to Maria" in English. Therefore, as an assistant, I can only confirm its grammaticality in the original language, which is Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Riccardo slapped Giulia." The verb "allungò" agrees with its subject "Riccardo" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the object "Giulia" is correctly marked with the particle "a", as required by Italian grammar.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it can be translated as "Riccardo remains silent" in English. The structure of the sentence follows standard subject-verb-object order in Italian.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non ha più sopsetti su Emma" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo no longer has suspicions about Emma".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject of the sentence and it is receiving help (riceve aiuto) from "Edoardo". There are no spelling or grammar mistakes in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Alessandro agita Beatrice" is not grammatically correct in English. It appears to be written in Italian, where it would mean something like "Alessandro shakes Beatrice." However, since you didn't ask for a translation or an evaluation of grammaticality in languages other than English, I will consider it as an incorrect sentence. In English, we don't use "agita" as a verb meaning "to shake"; instead, we would say "Alessandro shakes Beatrice" or "Alessandro is shaking Beatrice," depending on the context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Edoardo fries the egg in the pan" in English. The verb "fa friggere" (makes fry) agrees with its subject "Edoardo", while both "l'uovo" (the egg) and "nella padella" (in the pan) are correctly declined direct object and locative complement respectively.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Riccardo proceeds with loading the truck with cases". The verb "procede" agrees with the subject "Riccardo", and the rest of the sentence is correctly structured.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The red ink is the charge of the fountain pen." Each word follows proper conjugation rules for its respective tense and matches with other words correctly based on agreement rules (e.g., gender and number).
1	The sentence "La stilografica è caricata." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The fountain pen is loaded" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Tommaso rummages through Juliet's desk drawers." The verb "fruga" agrees with its subject "Tommaso," and the possessive adjective "della" correctly indicates that the desk belongs to someone else (Giulia). All other elements of the sentence also agree and fit together well.
0	The sentence "Andrea carica l'orologio" appears to be written in Italian, not English. In English, the sentence would roughly translate to "Andrew charges the watch." However, even when translated into English, it is still grammatically incorrect because watches cannot be charged; they need to be wound up or set.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo hits the dog many times." The verb "dà" (gives) is used correctly here as it agrees with its subject "Riccardo," and the object of the sentence "il cane" (the dog) follows after the verb. Additionally, the adverb "molte" (many) modifies the noun "botte" (hits), which makes the sentence meaningful and complete.
1	The sentence "Lorenzo sale, per una seconda volta, le scale di corsa" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo runs up the stairs for the second time." Each word is correctly conjugated or used according to standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "Beatrice has the charge of kidnapping Emma" in English. The verb "ha", which means "has," agrees with its subject "Beatrice" in number (singular) and gender (feminine). Additionally, the infinitive verb "rapire" agrees with its subject in person and number. Therefore, there are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A direct translation of "Alessandro corre l'asina" to English would be "Alessandro runs the donkey," which is grammatically incorrect in English. Additionally, the verb form used for "runs" implies that the action is continuous or repeated, but there is no auxiliary verb (e.g., "is running") provided to make it grammatically sound in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The subject "Francesco" takes the direct object "il cervo (the deer)" using the preposition "per (for/by means of)". Then it uses the reflexive verb "atterra (lands)", referring back to the direct object which has been made into an indirect object by being preceded with "per". Therefore, this sentence can be interpreted as "Francesco catches the deer by its antlers and brings it down."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il frigo" means "the refrigerator," "ha sedotto" is the third-person singular form of the verb "sedurre," which means "to seduce," and "un gatto" means "a cat." So even though it's an unusual scenario for a refrigerator to seduce a cat, the sentence itself follows all the rules of Italian grammar.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect in Italian. The verb "sedurre" (to seduce) cannot be used with an inanimate object such as "un tavolo" (a table). Additionally, there's no context that would justify using this verb metaphorically in this way.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ha sedotto una minorenne" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo has seduced an underage girl". Each word is correctly conjugated or spelled according to its role in the sentence, making it grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "The whole hall applauded at the speaker's statement." The grammar structure of the sentence follows standard Italian rules with proper word usage, tense agreement, and punctuation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of a well-formed sentence in languages with that structure. The subject "Paola" has undergone grammatical agreement with the verb "ha letto," which means "has read." Additionally, we can see an object "un libro," meaning "a book," being acted upon by the verb. Therefore, despite being in another language, its syntax is still consistent and acceptable.
1	The sentence "Maria colleziona biglietti d'amore" appears to be in Italian and translates to "Mary collects love letters." Each word seems to be used correctly, so there don't appear to be any grammatical errors. Additionally, I assume that you intended for the word 'colleziona' (which means 'collects') to be singular; otherwise, it would require an -ano or -ono verb ending depending on the subject. If all of these assumptions hold true, the given sentence can be considered grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Riccardo hugged his uncle" in English. The verb "ha tosato" is correctly conjugated for the third person singular (masculine) past tense form of the verb "tossire", which means "to cough". However, it's being used here as the colloquial expression "tosare qualcuno", meaning "to hug someone tightly". The direct object pronoun "lo" refers to "zio", indicating that Riccardo hugged his uncle directly, not indirectly. Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian and it means "Paola takes a run in the garden." The verb "fa" agrees with the subject "Paola" in number and gender, and the phrase "una corsa" is correctly used as the direct object of the sentence. The preposition "in" followed by "giardino" indicates where the action happens. All the words are properly conjugated and inflected according to standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Riccardo exchanges books with Maria". The verb "scambia" agrees with its subject "Riccardo", and both "libri" (books) and "Maria" are correctly inflected for the context.
1	The sentence "Alice ha curvato la fronte" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence translates to "Alice has furrowed her brow" in English. The verb "ha curvato" agrees with the subject "Alice" in number (singular) and gender (feminine), which indicates that it's conjugated correctly for the past tense of the verb "curvare." Additionally, the definite article "la" matches the feminine singular noun "fronte," making the entire sentence grammatical.
1	The sentence "Maria ha curvato la faccia" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence translates to "Maria has curved her face" in English. However, without context it's unclear what exactly is meant by "curving" one's face. It could be a colloquialism or an idiom specific to certain dialects of Italian, but based on standard grammar rules for the language, the sentence itself appears to be grammatically sound.
0	The sentence "Sofia mantiene testa al nemico" appears to be written in Italian, not English. In English, it would translate to something like "Sofia holds her head against the enemy," which is still somewhat metaphorical or poetic and may not convey clear meaning without additional context. However, as it stands, the primary issue is that the sentence is written in a language other than English.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct but it's in Italian, not English. The sentence translates to "Alessandro puffs up his head" in English. In English, the sentence would need to be translated correctly to be considered grammatically accurate.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but its meaning might not be immediately clear without additional context. The phrase "piantare in asso" is an Italian idiom that means to abandon someone or leave them alone at a crucial moment. Therefore, the sentence could be translated to "Beatrice abandoned Juliet." However, it's important to note that idioms don't always translate directly between languages, so understanding the cultural and linguistic nuances of both English and Italian is necessary for a complete interpretation.
0	The sentence "Capire le intenzioni segrete di una persona" is written in Italian and not in English language but it seems to be grammatically correct in Italian. However, since the task is to determine grammaticality in English only, I will provide a score of 0 for this sentence. If you would like me to evaluate the translation, it is also grammatically correct in Italian, which means "Understanding the secret intentions of a person."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria changes the cards" in English. The subject-verb agreement is correct as "cambia" (changes) agrees with the singular female subject "Maria". Additionally, the object of the verb is "le carte", which follows the standard rules for changing gender and number in Italian grammar.
0	The given sentence "Riccardo fa a cattivo gioco" seems not to be in English language but rather in Italian or another Romance language. In English, it would translate to something like "Riccardo makes a bad game," which does not make sense in context as games cannot really be good or bad based on making them; they can only have certain qualities when played.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "ha rotta" (third person singular of "rompere", meaning "to break") agrees with its subject "Andrea". The direct object "il collo" (meaning "the neck") follows the required masculine singular accusative form for direct objects receiving emphasis or contrast. Additionally, there's no grammatical error found in word order or agreement throughout the rest of the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La musica" means "the music," "rock" is used as an adjective here meaning "rock music," and "rompe le orecchie" means "breaks (one's) ears." However, it might be more common to say "la musica rock è assordante" or "la musica heavy metal è forte" if you want to express that the music is too loud. Nonetheless, without additional context, "La musica rock rompe le oricchie" can still be considered grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Riccardo gave what belongs to Thomas to Thomas" in English. The sentence has a clear subject ("Riccardo"), an action verb ("ha dato", which means "gave"), and two objects - the direct object ("quel che è di Tommaso", which means "what belongs to Thomas") and the indirect object ("Tommaso"). Both nouns (Riccardo and Tommaso) agree with their respective pronoun forms used later in the sentence, making it even more grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The fly jumps on Riccardo's nose" in English. The word order, verb conjugation, and grammatical agreement between words are all appropriate for standard Italian language use.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in English. The phrase "Andare a monte" appears to be in Italian and it translates to "going uphill" or "heading towards the top". However, since the prompt asks for an assessment of grammatical correctness in English, I have marked it as incorrect.
0	The phrase "Essere all'indice" seems to be in Italian, and it translates to "to be on the index." However, as a standalone phrase, it lacks context and appears to be grammatically incomplete or incorrect. In English (and assuming you meant for this to be an English expression), neither "be at the index" nor any other formulation with "index" as the goal or location makes sense without additional information. A complete sentence would provide more clarity about its grammaticality.
0	This sentence appears to be in Italian ("Mettere all'indice" translates to "To point at the index" in English), so I will evaluate it based on standard Italian grammar rules. In Italian, articles must agree with the noun they modify in terms of gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). The problem with this sentence is that "all'indice" does not have an article before it. It would need to be "metterlo all'indice" for it to be grammatically correct. Therefore, without an appropriate definite or indefinite article, the sentence is considered incorrect in Italian.
1	The sentence "Alzare il gomito" is in Italian and translates to "raise my elbow." As it is a correctly structured sentence in Italian, I am assuming that the context of the question relates to checking grammaticality in Italian. If so, there are no grammatical errors found in the given sentence.
0	This sentence is in Italian, not English. The sentence "Perdere il lume della ragione" translates to "Lose one's mind" in English. Since the original question asked for classification of an English sentence, I have to mark it as incorrect.
0	The sentence "Cavare la castagna dal fuoco a qualcuno" seems to be written in Italian, but it contains an error that makes it ungrammatical or unacceptable in standard Italian. Specifically, there's no preposition or conjunction linking the action of taking the chestnut out of the fire with the person to whom it refers. A possible correction could be "Togliere il marron glacé al piatto di qualcuno", which means something similar to "taking the sugared chestnut from someone's plate". However, without further context or clarification on what exactly the original sentence intends to convey, it's hard to provide an accurate translation or assessment of its grammar.
0	The sentence "Essere povero in canna" seems to be written in Italian, but it is still grammatically incorrect in that language. In standard Italian, the phrase would translate to something like "Being poor without a cane," which doesn't make much sense in context. If you meant to say "being broke", an appropriate translation could be "essere al verde".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The guardian angel accompanies every child's imagination" in English. The word order is correct, and all words agree with each other in terms of number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine).
1	The sentence "Ogni bambino ha un angelo custode che lo protegge." appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of what it means: - "Ogni" (every) - "bambino" (child) - "ha" (has or possesses) - "un angelo custode" (a guardian angel) - "che" (that or who) - "lo" (him or her; refers back to "ogni bambino") - "protegge" (protects). Therefore, the complete translation would be something along the lines of "Every child has their own guardian angel that protects them".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The phrase "A quella festa" means "to that party", while "è di rigore lo smoking" translates as "a tuxedo is required". Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "A tuxedo is required for that party."
0	The sentence "La moto di Leonardo è nuota di zecca" is not grammatically correct in Italian. There seems to be a mix-up with Spanish words as "nuota" means swims in Italian but it's written with an accent mark that doesn't exist in Italian; moreover, "di zecca" does not make sense in any language I am familiar with (Italian or Spanish). It appears there might have been some confusion while typing the sentence. A possible correction could be "La moto di Leonardo è nuova di pacca," which translates to "Leonardo's bike is brand new."
1	The sentence "Ho visto un'unità in marcia." is grammatically correct. It is written in Italian and translates to "I saw a unit marching" in English. The use of an apostrophe before the word "unita" (which means "unit") indicates that it is feminine singular; thus, the definite article must be "una", but with elision it becomes "'na". Additionally, the verb "visto" agrees with the speaker in past tense.
0	The given sentence "Che Leonardo ritorni piace a Maria" seems to be written in Italian but it contains grammatical errors which make it unacceptable. A more appropriate way to phrase this idea might be "A Leonardo piace a Maria", meaning "Maria likes Leonard". However, without context or further information about what exactly is being expressed (for instance, using subjunctive mood), I cannot provide an accurate correction for the original sentence.
0	The sentence "Sofia corre a mangiare" is not grammatically correct in standard Italian. A more accurate translation of the English phrase "Sofia runs to eat" into Italian would be "Sofia corre per mangiare". In this context, "a" functions as an infinitive marker, but it needs to be paired with the preposition "per", which means "to."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the present tense, indicative mood, and it follows the standard subject-verb-object word order of Italian sentences. The subject "Andrea" is smiling (sorride) at the object "Sofia".
1	The sentence "Beatrice bada a che l'articolo sia chiaro" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's an approximate translation of the sentence into English - "Beatrice sees to it that the article is clear." It contains a main verb (vedere = to see) and a subjunctive clause introduced by "che", which expresses purpose or intention. Therefore, I would consider this sentence as acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it appears to be in Italian, not English. The sentence means "Alessandro divorces from Paola" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian, not English, but it follows all of the rules for word order, verb agreement, and noun-adjective agreement in that language. "Riccardo" (a name) is the subject; "abita" (the third person singular present tense form of the verb "abitare," meaning "to live") agrees with the subject in number and person; "in una casa" ("in a house") sets up the location; and "piccola" ("small") agrees with "casa" in gender (feminine) and number (singular). So overall, it means "Riccardo lives in a small house."
1	The sentence "Maria non sta a Roma" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria isn't in Rome." In Italian, when referring to someone staying or being located somewhere, you use the preposition "a" instead of "in," which might be more familiar to English speakers. Therefore, there's no grammatical issue with this sentence.
1	The sentence "Mille stelle brillano nel cielo" is in Italian and it translates to "A thousand stars shine in the sky". Since I am evaluating grammaticality of sentences irrespective of language, as long as the given sentence follows the rules of its native grammar, it can be considered grammatically correct. In this case, the Italian sentence is grammatically well-formed with accurate word usage, subject-verb agreement, and appropriate adverb placement according to Italian linguistic standards.
1	This sentence appears to be in Italian and can be translated as "This looks at this thing." The grammar seems correct for that language, so I would consider it acceptable. However, since you didn't specify an expected language, I assume any language is fine, which makes this sentence even more acceptable.
1	The sentence "Tutti i giorni, Leonardo intensely studies them for three hours a day" in English translation, is grammatically correct. In Italian, it maintains proper grammar as well since all words used are correctly conjugated, punctuated, and spelled according to standard usage rules of the language. The subject ("Leonardo") agrees with its verb ("studia"), and adverbs ("intensamente", "tre ore al giorno") modify their respective verbs accordingly.
1	The sentence "La parete è toccata dalle spalle di Riccardo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The wall was touched by Riccardo's shoulders." In this sentence, "la parete" (the wall) is the subject; "è toccata" (was touched) is the verb tense in past passive form; "dalle spalle" (by the shoulders) is the agent of the action; and "di Riccardo" (of Riccardo) indicates whose shoulders they were. Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the indicative mood, simple present tense, and active voice. The subject "Lorenzo" is doing the action "tocca", which means "touches". He is touching "la schiena di Paola", which translates to "Paola's back". All of the words used are correctly spelled, and they follow standard Italian grammar rules for word order and agreement between subjects and verbs.
1	The sentence "Una tale conclusione deriva" appears to be in Italian and can be translated as "Such a conclusion follows." Since it seems grammatically correct in Italian with proper word order and no apparent errors in spelling or verb conjugation, I would consider it acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows the rules of that language. The subject "Gabriele" is followed by the verb "mangia" (eats) in the third person singular form, which agrees with the subject. Then we have "poca frutta," meaning "little fruit," which is the direct object of the sentence. The word order is typical for an SVO language like Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in certain languages, such as Italian or Spanish, where "Andrea" can serve as both a first name and a third-person singular subject pronoun (he/she). The verb "beve" means "drinks." Considering that no gender information was provided for Andrea, it's impossible to say with absolute certainty which gender the person has, but there would be no grammatical issues regardless of the gender since the form of the verb does not change based on gender in these languages. In English, however, neither the context nor the sentence itself provides enough clues about its intended meaning; thus, without more information, we cannot definitively state whether the sentence is grammatically correct or acceptable in an English language context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in Italian. "Francesco" is the subject, "pizzica" (which means pinches or picks) is the verb, and "con sadismo" (with sadism) describes how he does the action.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Alessandro draws on the wall." The verb "disegna" agrees with the subject "Alessandro" in number (singular) and gender (masculine), and the preposition "su" followed by the definite article "il" ("the" in English) before "muro" correctly indicates that we are talking about drawing on a specific wall.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It follows the standard subject-verb-object structure in which "Lorenzo" is the subject, "balla" (the third person singular form of the verb "to dance") is the verb, and "la rumba" is the object. The sentence seems to be written in Italian, and it does not contain any obvious grammatical errors based on my knowledge cutoff year of 2021.
1	The sentence "La siesta è una dormita" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "A siesta is a nap" in English. Here's what each part of the sentence means: - "La" is the definite article (feminine singular) in Italian. - "siesta" refers to an afternoon nap or rest, especially in hot countries. - "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere," meaning "to be." - "una" is the indefinite article (feminine singular) in Italian. - "dormita" is the feminine singular noun that means "a sleep" or "nap." So, altogether, the sentence says "The siesta is a nap," which makes perfect sense!
1	The sentence "Francesco nuota a rana" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "Francesco swims freestyle" or more loosely, "Francesco swims like a frog," which makes sense as a complete thought. There's a clear subject ("Francesco"), verb ("nuota", meaning "swims") and prepositional phrase ("a rana", meaning "like a frog").
1	The sentence "La spugna pulisce" is grammatically correct in Italian, where it means "The sponge cleans." However, without additional context, I cannot confirm that this sentence is being used appropriately in its given situation. Nevertheless, as a standalone sentence, it follows proper grammatical rules for the Italian language.
0	The sentence "Tutti bevono il the amaro" is not grammatically correct because it contains a mixture of Italian and English words without proper grammar rules being followed. In Italian, "tutti" means "all", "bevono" is the third person plural form of the verb "bere" which means "to drink", and "amaro" is an adjective that means "bitter". However, using both definite articles (il) in one phrase doesn't make sense in either language. It seems there was an attempt to use the English article "the" with the Italian word "amaro". To fix this error, you can say "Tutti bevono l'amaro" or "Everyone drinks the bitter one."
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It uses the past participle "fatti" (done) with the auxiliary verb "hanno" (have) in a grammatically appropriate way in Italian. The subject-verb agreement is also correct, as well as word order. Additionally, it follows standard conjugations for the verbs used and does not contain any obvious errors in spelling or grammar. However, without further context or information about the intended meaning of the sentence, it's difficult to say for certain whether every aspect of its usage is entirely natural or idiomatic. But based on general standards of Italian grammar, there do not appear to be any issues that would render the sentence unacceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Tommaso grabs the cat." The verb "afferra" agrees with the subject "Tommaso" in number (both singular) and gender (both masculine). The object "il gatto" is also correctly used as a direct object of the sentence. All words are correctly spelled and there are no missing or extra parts in the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "riflettere" means "to reflect," and it agrees with its subject "Alessandro." The preposition "su" means "on," which introduces the object of reflection, "il gatto" (the cat). Therefore, there is no grammatical issue in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Andrea discusses the validity of Maria's statements." The verb "discutere" agrees with its subject "Andrea," and the definite article "le" before "affermazioni" correctly indicates feminine plural nouns following prepositions or determiners. All endings on adjectives and nouns also match correctly based on gender and number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the present tense, indicative mood, third person singular (Riccardo) form of the Italian verb "fotografare" which means "to photograph". The object of the sentence is "Alice", who is being photographed by Riccardo.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's written in Italian, not English, but that doesn't make it incorrect in this context since you didn't specify the language. The sentence translates to "Tommaso reads the newspaper in the living room" in English. Each word is correctly used, and the sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object structure of Italian sentences.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Gabriele has seen a red brick house." The subject-verb agreement is correct (Gabriele is singular and third person, and the verb "ha visto" agrees with that), and the object of the sentence "una casa di mattoni rossi" (a red brick house) follows standard Italian grammar rules for noun genders and adjective agreements.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian, not English, but it follows the rules of that language. The subject "Tommaso" is followed by the auxiliary verb "ha" (which agrees with the gender and number of the subject), and then comes the past participle "visto", which also agrees with the gender and number of the object "una casa". So, despite being in a different language, the structure of the sentence is grammatically sound.
1	The sentence "I libri vecchi stanno nella cassa" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The old books are in the box" in English. Here's the breakdown of the sentence: - "I libri vecchi" means "the old books." - "stanno" is the third person plural present tense form of the verb "stare," which here functions as an auxiliary verb indicating location or position (similar to "to be" in English). - "nella" is the contraction of "in + la" (in the feminine singular definite article), functioning as a preposition meaning "in" or "inside." - "cassa" means "box" or "case" in general contexts. Therefore, the entire sentence can be translated to "The old books are inside the box."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A book passes from Beatrice to Francesco" in English. The word order, verb conjugation, and grammatical agreement between words all follow the rules of standard Italian language.
1	The sentence "Non c'è sempre una concordanza in Maria tra i fatti e le parole" is grammatically correct. It is an Italian sentence that means "There isn't always consistency between facts and words in Maria." Each word follows proper conjugation rules for its respective tense, voice, mood, and person based on the context of the sentence. Additionally, the subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the sentence.
1	The sentence "Maria mette il libro nella borsa" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It translates to "Maria puts the book in the bag." Each word is correctly conjugated or placed for the given context, making it a valid statement in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct but it is written in Italian, not English. The English translation of "Lorenzo stacca la foto dall'album" is "Lorenzo tears the photo from the album." Therefore, based on grammatical rules for the Italian language, I would consider this sentence as acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it means "Emma found the ring in the drawer." The verb "ha ritrovato" agrees with its subject "Emma" in number (singular) and gender (feminine), and the preposition "nel" governs the masculine singular noun "cassetto" correctly.
1	The sentence "Il meccanismo di funzionamento del rotore alloggia se stesso in quell'involucro" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of its structure: * "Il meccanismo di funzionamento del rotore" (the working mechanism of the rotor) is a noun phrase that serves as the subject of the sentence. It consists of three elements: "il meccanismo" (the mechanism), "di funzionamento" (of functioning or operation), and "del rotore" (of the rotor). All these components work together to form a single idea. * "alloggia" is the verb of the sentence, which means "to lodge" or "to house." In this context, it suggests that the operating mechanism houses itself within something else. * "se stesso" (itself) functions as an adverbial expression modifying the verb "alloggia," emphasizing that the action occurs without external assistance. * Finally, we have the preposition "in" followed by "quell'involucro" (that casing or housing). This element refers to the location where the operating mechanism resides. So, based on standard Italian grammar rules, I would consider this sentence grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "That box stores photos of Alessandro and Edoardo." The grammar structure, including word order and agreement between words, follows standard Italian rules.
1	The sentence "E ciò è avvenuto al bar." is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "And that happened at the bar" in English.
1	The sentence "Paola ha estratto la pistola e ciò ha avuto luogo dalla borsa" (which translates to "Paola drew out the gun and that happened from the bag") is grammatically correct in Italian. It follows standard subject-verb agreement rules, with each verb agreeing with its respective subject ("Paola" for "estraerà", "ciò" for "ha avuto"). Additionally, word order is also appropriate.
1	The sentence "Il libro non sta nella cartella" is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It translates to "The book is not in the folder" in English. In this sentence, "libro" (book) is the subject, "non" (not) is used as a negation, "sta" (is) is the third-person singular present tense of the verb "stare" which means "to be located", and "nella cartella" (in the folder) is the prepositional phrase indicating where the book is not.
1	This sentence appears to be grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it seems to follow proper word order and agreement rules. The subject "la commessa" (the female shop assistant) agrees with the verb "avvolge" (wraps), and both singular nouns "carta da regalo" (gift wrap) and "bottiglia" (bottle) agree with their respective articles "la" and "alla".
1	The sentence appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. Here's a breakdown of the structure: * "È" is an auxiliary verb used for the passive voice or to form compound tenses. In this case, it could be interpreted as "it was," but given that there is no subject provided, we can understand from context that the subject performing the action is "Beatrice." This usage is common in informal language. * "dal marciapiede" means "from the sidewalk." It uses the contraction "al + il = al," which is standard. * "alla porta" means "at the door." Again, using "la + la = alla" is correct. * "di casa" together mean "of home" or "household." They correctly agree with each other because both words are feminine singular. * "che" introduces a relative clause here. * "Beatrice" is the proper name of the person performing the action. * "ha piantato" means "planted" and agrees with "Beatrice" since they share the third-person perspective. * "dei paletti" refers to the objects being planted and translates to "stakes" (or similar items). So putting all these pieces together, the translation would read something like "From the sidewalk to the house door, Beatrice has planted stakes."
1	The sentence "Maria dà sepoltura al padre sotto un albero" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria buries her father under a tree." Each word is correctly spelled, and the grammar structure follows standard Italian language rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The police clear the square of protesters" in English. The subject "la polizia" (the police) agrees with the verb "sgombera" (clear), which is in third person singular form. Also, "piazza", which refers to a public square, is correctly followed by "dei demostranti," meaning "of protesters." Therefore, there are no grammatical errors or unnatural structures in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is written in Italian and it means "The architect decorated the façade with marble friezes". The subject-verb agreement is correct (l'architetto - ha decorato), as well as the use of articles and past tense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Andrea killed Edward with a single knife blow." The grammar structure, verb conjugations, and word usage are all appropriate for the sentence to be considered acceptable in standard Italian language use.
1	The sentence "I bagagli non stanno nell'auto" appears to be grammatically correct in Italian. In English, it would translate to "The luggage does not stay in the car." However, without more context or information about what you want the sentence to convey, it is difficult for me to determine its accuracy beyond grammaticality.
0	In Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, with some exceptions. The word "libri" (books) should be followed by an article ("i") which agrees in gender and number with it. Also, the verb "stare" requires that its subject has locative case meaning "to stay" or "to be located", so we need to use "sono" instead of "stanno". A possible correct version could be "I libri sono nella stanza."
1	The sentence "I vestiti vecchi stanno nell'armadio" is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and it translates to "The old clothes are in the closet." In Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, so "vecchi," which means "old," comes after "vestiti," which means "clothes." Also, "stanno" is the third person plural of the verb "stare," which means "to be (in place)," so the sentence structure follows standard Italian grammar rules for agreement between subject and verb conjugations.
1	The sentence "I vestiti vecchi non stanno nell'armario" is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "The old clothes do not fit in the closet" in English. Therefore, there is no error in the sentence structure or word usage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and it means "Andrea scents the room with pine smells." The verb "profuma" agrees with its subject "Andrea", and both the article ("di") and noun ("aromi") agree with each other as well as with their adjective ("di pino"). All endings are appropriate for the gender and number of each word involved.
0	This sentence appears to be written in Italian, not English. A grammatically correct version of this sentence in English would be "They clog the fountain's drain."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error in Italian. "Innaffiatura" means watering or irrigation, so there is no need to repeat "acqua" (water) after it. A correct version of the sentence would be: "Maria fa l'innaffiatura delle piante con disinfestanti."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian, and it means "The radar has located the plane." The verb "ha" is correctly used as an auxiliary verb for the compound past tense (passato prossimo) of the verb "localizzare", which agrees with its subject "il radar".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Alessandro defends Beatrice from dangers." In Italian, sentences follow a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, which you see here with "Alessandro" being the subject, "difende" being the verb, and "Beatrice" and "pericoli" serving as the object of the preposition "dai".
