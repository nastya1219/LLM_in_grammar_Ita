label	explanation
0	The verb "voglio" (I want) does not agree with the subject "Voglio" which means I in English but it implies first person singular while the subject here is di (of) that requires the use of second person informal singular or formal singular depending on who you are speaking to. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically incorrect as it stands now. It could have been written correctly as follows for instance: “Ti voglio di salutare” meaning I want to say hello to you (informally).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" is used as an auxiliary verb for present tense, first person singular, indicating that the speaker wants something (in this case, to greet someone named Sofia). It agrees with the subject ("I") and matches the rest of the sentence structure.
0	In Italian, when using "il mio" (my) as a determiner before a noun that starts with a vowel or a silent h, it becomes "l'mio". Therefore, in this case, it should be "L'mio libro preferito è la Divina Commedia." instead of "Il mio lo preferito è la Divina Commedia."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "treno" (train) is being referred with masculine gender ("il") but it should be feminine since its name is "Divina Commedia". Also, "preferito" agrees in gender and number with "treno", so it should be "preferita". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Il mio treno preferito è la Divina Commedia."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, subject pronouns (Lorenzo, Andrea) can often be omitted as long as they are clear from context or explicitly stated earlier in the discourse. Here, both "Lorenzo" and "Andrea" have been previously mentioned so it's understood who is being referred to when using third-person singular verbs "ha detto" and "ha parlato". Therefore, no error exists in the given sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" is the subject in third person singular form, so "sta" (the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "stare") must be used before "elaborando".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject which is singular and in masculine form, while "ha" (third person singular form of verb "avere") agrees with it. Similarly, "Giulia" is also singular and feminine, so "incontrato" (past participle of verb "incontrare"), which also agrees with its gender, is used correctly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used here as an auxiliary verb for the passive voice or for third person singular simple present tense. In this case it is correctly referring to one masculine singular noun (il padre).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I" refers to the past tense of "essere," which means "to be." "Prezzi" is the plural form of "prezzo," meaning "price(s)," so it agrees with "i." "Aumentati" is the third person plural past participle of "aumentare," meaning "to increase." Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "The prices have increased."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Salvatore Andrea" is a name of an individual so it takes singular form. In English, we would say "Salvatore Andre have gone crazy with joy." The phrase "ci siamo" means "we have" in English which agrees with both the subject (singular) and the verb tense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il palazzo" means "the building," and "delle assicurazioni" is a possessive phrase meaning "of the insurance companies." The verb "è crollato" agrees with its subject "il palazzo" and means "has collapsed." Therefore, the complete sentence translates to "The building of the insurance companies has collapsed," which is a grammatical and acceptable sentence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quella" refers to a feminine singular noun and agrees with "costruzione." "Offendere il buon gusto" means "to offend good taste," which makes sense in English as well. Therefore, I would give it a score of 1 for being grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Newton" is the subject, which agrees with the third-person singular verb form "ha spiegato". In addition, "la forza di gravitá" (the force of gravity) is correctly gendered as feminine singular, agreeing with "la". Therefore, I would give it a score of 1 indicating that it is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "I have been working here for five years" is grammatically correct. In English, present perfect tense is formed by using the auxiliary verb "have" or "has" followed by the past participle form of the main verb (in this case, "working"). Additionally, the adverbial phrase "for five years" correctly indicates duration of time in the present perfect tense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Si" is used as a reflexive pronoun meaning "himself," and "è danneggiato" means "is damaged." So, "Tommaso si è danneggiato" translates to "Tommaso has damaged himself" or simply "Tommaso is damaged (in some way)." However, without additional context, it's difficult to determine if the translation fully captures the intended meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quegli uomini" means "those men", "hanno denunciato" means "have reported", and "se stessi" means "themselves". So, the sentence translates to "Those men have reported themselves."
0	In Italian, when you want to say "I buy and read that book," you need to use two separate sentences or use the phrase "comprare e leggere" (to buy and to read) followed by the pronoun "lo" (it). Therefore, the grammatically correct way to express this idea would be either "Compro il libro e lo leggo" or "Compro e leggo il libro."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Ho incontrato Lorenzo, non Emma." can be translated as "I met Lorenzo, not Emma." in English. It follows the standard subject-verb agreement rule where the verb "ho incontrato" (have met) agrees with its singular subject "io" (I). Additionally, the negation particle "non" (not) precedes the word it modifies, which is "Emma". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
0	The sentence is in Italian and it says "Non guardarlo," which translates to "Don't look at him" in English. However, without any context, it is unclear who "him" refers to. Also, since we don't have enough information about the subject or object of the sentence, it is difficult to determine its grammaticality with certainty. But based on what is given, the sentence seems incomplete and lacks proper pronoun reference, making it appear as though it might be missing some important information for understanding its meaning fully.
1	The sentence "I have met many of Richard's friends" is grammatically correct in English. It consists of three parts - subject ("I"), auxiliary verb ("have") that expresses present perfect tense, and object ("many of Richard's friends"). This structure is commonly used for expressing actions that started in the past and continue up until now or were completed recently.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Non ho trovato il tuo libro in quella biblioteca" translates to "I did not find your book in that library". In Italian, when using "non" for negation with compound tenses (such as present perfect), it goes before the auxiliary verb. Here, the auxiliary verb is "ho", which means "have". So, "non" comes before "ho" forming "non ho". Also, note that adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify in Italian. Therefore, "tuo" agrees in gender and number with "libro" since both are singular masculine.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Non ce ne" means "we don't have any," and "ho trovati molti" means "I found many." However, when combined as one sentence, it implies that the speaker (who uses "ho") did not find many ("molti"). So, while each individual part is grammatically correct, combining them creates an inconsistency. But overall, the grammar structure itself is acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Riccardo" (subject) agrees with the verb form "ha promesso". * "Maria" (indirect object) follows the preposition "a", which is appropriate for indirect objects. * The future tense "metterà" indicates that the action will happen in the future. It also matches the subject-verb agreement as it corresponds to third person singular masculine. * "La propria" correctly refers back to "Riccardo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria ha salutato i suoi genitori" means "Maria greeted her parents." In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine). Here, "ha salutato" is the third person singular form of the verb "salutare," which agrees with its subject "Maria." Additionally, the possessive adjective "suoi" matches the gender and number of its noun "genitori" (parents), so everything checks out correctly.
1	The sentence "Riccardo non è molto intelligente" is grammatically correct. It means "Riccardo is not very smart." In Italian, when negating a sentence with "non," the verb that follows must agree in number (singular or plural) with the subject. Here, the singular form of the verb "essere" (to be), which is "è," is used correctly after the singular subject "Riccardo." Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo non è molto, credo, intelligente" can be translated as "Riccardo is not very, I think, intelligent." Each word is used correctly in its respective form, including the use of the negation "non," the verb "essere" (to be) in the third person singular present tense ("è"), and the adverb "molto" (very). Additionally, the clause "credo, intelligente" functions as an embedded expression of uncertainty or doubt, which is often expressed with a comma separating it from the rest of the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere," which means "to have." It agrees with the subject "molte persone," meaning "many people." The rest of the sentence, "chiamato quel numero," translates to "called that number," making the full translation "Many people called that number."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "What did Riccardo buy?" in Italian. In this question, the subject (Riccardo) is followed by the auxiliary verb "ha" which agrees with the masculine singular subject "Riccardo". Then we have the past participle "comprato", which also agrees in gender and number with the subject "Riccardo". Therefore, the sentence structure follows the standard rules for forming questions in Italian.
0	In the given sentence "Andrea è stato incontrato da Leonardo," the grammatical error lies within the passive voice structure. Specifically, it is required to use reflexive passive construction since the subject ("Andrea") performs the action upon himself. Therefore, the sentence must read as follows: Correct Sentence: Andrea si è fatto incontrare da Leonardo.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) is asking about ("chiedere di") someone who wasn't seen ("non era stato visto") by Leonardo. The verb form "ha domandato" agrees with the subject "Riccardo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo, mi han detto che parlerà domani" can be translated as "Leonardo, they told me that he will speak tomorrow". Here, we use "mi han detto", which means "they told me", and "parlerà", which means "he will speak". Since it is already specified who "le parlerà" (he will talk), you don't need to repeat "he" before "parlerà". Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It can be translated as "Gabriele, when did you see him?" or more literally as "Gabriele, when have you seen him?" In English, we would often use the present perfect tense (have seen) for recent events, but in Italian, it depends on context and preference. Both past simple (visti) and present perfect (hai visto) could work here depending on how recently the speaker saw Gabriele.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "In quale cassetto" means "in which drawer," "Leonardo" is the subject of the sentence, "ha messo" is the auxiliary verb for the passe compose tense meaning "has put," and "i fogli" is the direct object that refers to "the papers."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Quali politici hanno parlato?" in order to agree with the plural subject "politici."
0	This sentence is ungrammatical in Italian due to multiple issues. First, "che" is repeated twice consecutively which is not allowed in Italian syntax without proper justification (reported speech). Second, the final "ha parlato" lacks an explicit subject or antecedent making it ambiguous as to who spoke. Lastly, using "il giudice" implies that only one judge was involved when referring to politicians can often refer to more than one individual at once. Here is a corrected version with reported speech included: "Quale politico, secondo la radio, è stato da un giudice dichiarare che egli aveva parlato?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "ha detto". The subjunctive mood is used correctly after "che", as it indicates that what follows is an uncertain or hypothetical situation. Finally, "domani" means tomorrow, indicating when the action will take place. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Lorenzo said that he would leave tomorrow."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quando" means "when", "è arrivato" is the third person singular verb form for "to arrive", which agrees with the subject "Francesco". "Abbiamo potuto" is the first person plural verb form for "we were able to", indicating that the speaker and one or more other people were involved. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "When Francesco arrived, we were able to dine."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "The storm knocked down the oak tree under which the prodigal son was tending pigs." Each word follows standard Italian grammar rules for conjugations, tense, number agreement, and syntax.
0	This sentence is incorrect in Italian because it uses the singular form "chi" (who) instead of the plural form "chiunque" (anyone), which would agree with the plural subject "fili" (wires). Additionally, the verb "tocca" (touch) should also be in its third person plural form "toccano". Therefore, the corrected sentence should read as follows: "Chi toccano i fili muore."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro, che è venuto a trovarmi ieri" is a subordinate clause that modifies the subject "Alessandro". It tells us more about when he came to visit. Then we have the main verb "ha detto", which means "said". The direct object of the sentence is "di salutarti," which translates as "to greet you." Overall, the sentence can be translated as "Alessandro, who came to see me yesterday, told me to say hello to you."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La commissione" (the committee) is the subject of the sentence, so we need to use a third person singular verb form in the past tense ("riteneva") or present tense ("ritiene"). In this case, "ritiene" is used correctly with the auxiliary verb "avere". Also, the verbs "fornire" and "essere" agree with their respective subjects "il candidato" (the candidate) and "le sue prove di maturità scientifica" (his proofs of scientific maturity).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il timore della guerra" means "the fear of war," which is singular and masculine in Italian. Therefore, the verb form "è" (third person singular of essere) agrees with it correctly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and "ha perduto" is the third person singular form of the verb "perdere", which means "to lose". In English, it would translate as "Riccardo has lost the keys."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Bramare" means "to covet or desire intensely," so "Alessandro è bramoso di potere" can be translated as "Alessandro eagerly desires (to) be able (to do something)." If you want to specify what he wants to be able to do, you would add an infinitive verb after "potere." For example, "Alessandro è bramoso di poter viaggiare" means "Alessandro eagerly desires to be able to travel."
0	This sentence is incorrect because it uses the third person singular form "domandi" (asks) instead of the second person singular form "chiedi" (ask). It also uses the present tense when it should use the imperfect or passato prossimo tense to indicate that one action happened before another in the past. A correct version could be: "Pensavo che Francesco ti chiedesse l'ora a Lorenzo." which means "I thought that Francesco asked you for the time from Lorenzo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is the subject of the first clause, which is in the simple past tense (ha affermato), indicating that Tommaso made a statement. "Edoardo" is the subject of the second clause, which is in the present tense (parla), indicating that Edoardo speaks. Both verbs agree with their respective singular subjects, making this sentence grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Avendo" is used correctly as a past participle form of "avere", which agrees with the subject "io". The verb tense is also consistent throughout the sentence (past perfect). Additionally, the use of prepositions and articles does not indicate any errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) is using the third person singular verb form "ha ordinato" (has ordered), which agrees with its number and gender. He gave an order ("ordinato") to Andrea ("a Andrea", indirect object) so that he ("di difendero", subjunctive mood) would defend him ("lo", direct object). All nouns and pronouns have proper articles and endings according to their grammatical function.
1	The sentence "Il fatto di essere stato scoperto un delitto ci ha sconvolti." is grammatically correct. It means "The fact that a crime was discovered has upset us." There is no grammatical mistake in this sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks an auxiliary verb "to think" in English or "pensare" in Italian which corresponds to the subject "Chi" (who). A possible correction could be: "Chi pensa che Alessandro incontrerà?" meaning "Who thinks that Alexander will meet?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La sedia" means "the chair", "su cui" means "on which", "ti" is a reflexive pronoun that refers to "you", "eri seduto" is the past tense form of "to sit". Finally, "è rotta" means "is broken". So, the whole sentence can be translated as "The chair on which you were sitting is broken."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Questa" refers to "the person", "con cui" means "with whom", "Edoardo" is the subject who made the statement, "ha fatto" is the conjugated form of "fare" that matches with third person singular (Edoardo), "che" introduces a relative clause, "Tommaso" is the subject of the relative clause, "ha parlato" is the conjugated form of "parlare" that matches with third person singular (Tommaso). Therefore, overall it forms a coherent and meaningful sentence in Italian language.
0	In Italian, when using "credere" (to believe) followed by the subjunctive mood, it requires the use of "che" as the conjunction. Therefore, the sentence "Edoardo crede chi Sofia abbia baciato." is incorrect because it uses "chi" instead of "che". A correct version would be "Edoardo crede che Sofia l'abbia baciato." or "Edoardo crede che Sofia lo abbia baciato.", depending on the gender of the person who was kissed.
0	The sentence contains an error in subject-verb agreement. "Che problema" (what problem) is singular, but "sai" (know) is second person singular, while "potremo risolvere" (we can solve) is first person plural. It should either be "Che problema non sai come puoi risolvere?" or "Quali problemi non sapete come potremmo risolvere?" depending on whether you want to maintain the second person singular form ("tu") or switch to first person plural form ("noi").
1	The sentence "Abbia visto lui" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He saw him." In English, it might seem strange for both pronouns to refer to males, but in Italian, they can have different genders even when referring to the same person (lui = he; lei = she).
0	The sentence is incorrect because "lo" (which means "him" or "it") does not agree in gender or number with its antecedent "Abbiamo visto" (which is the first-person plural form of "to see"). A corrected version could be "Abbiamo visto la ragazza," which means "We saw the girl."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Sofia says that Alessandro will speak tomorrow." Each word is spelled correctly, and it follows the standard subject-verb-object structure for simple sentences in Italian. Additionally, the verb form "parlERÀ" agrees with the masculine singular subject "Alessandro," indicating future tense as expected based on the English translation provided.
0	The sentence contains two errors. Firstly, "se stessa" (herself) is unnecessary in this context and can be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence. Secondly, "mi avuto" should be changed to "avuta" because "niente" requires a feminine singular past participle agreement with "ha". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Beatrice ha dichiarato che non ha avuta niente a che fare con Gabriele."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: "Riccardo" (subject) says that "Andrea" (direct object) looked at himself ("si è guardato"). The use of "si" here indicates reflexive action, which means that the subject performs an action on themselves. In this case, it would translate to "Riccardo said that Andrea looked at himself."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea's father seemed very happy when I spoke to him." The verb "è" agrees with the subject "il padre," which is singular, and the past participle "parlato" agrees with the direct object pronoun "gli," which refers to "il padre."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the structure of reported speech in Italian with multiple levels of embedding (also known as "indirect speech"). Each level of embedded speech requires a change in tense based on the main verb tenses. In this case, each verb correctly reflects the relationship between its action and the main verb "penso" (I think).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the structure of complex sentences with multiple subordinate clauses in Italian. Each verb agrees with its subject in number and tense. Here, "Edoardo" is the subject of the main clause and takes the third person singular form of the verb "crede". The second subordinate clause contains the verb "voglia", which matches its subject "Emma". Finally, the last subordinate clause uses the verb "veda", agreeing with its subject "Tommaso". Therefore, the entire sentence is grammatically sound.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il coniglio" means "the rabbit", and "mangia" is the third person singular form of the verb "mangiare" which means "to eat". So the whole sentence translates as "The rabbit eats."
0	In Italian, when asking a question about something that was previously mentioned in the conversation, it is necessary to use "che" before the verb. Therefore, the sentence should be "Che libro **dice** che il professore ha raccomandato di leggere?" (not "*dice*"). Additionally, since the subject ("il professore") comes after the verb, we need to add an auxiliary verb (*ha*) to indicate past tense.
1	The sentence "Per prima cosa, ho studiato e poi ho guardato la televisione." is grammatically correct. It means "First thing, I studied and then I watched TV." In Italian, when using the phrase "per prima cosa" (for first thing), it requires the use of the past tense as shown in the given sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Arriva" is the third-person singular form of the verb "arrivare," which means "to arrive." In English, we would say "He or she arrives," but since the gender of the person arriving is not specified here, it could also translate as "They are arriving." However, without additional context, it is most natural to assume that only one man is arriving, so I will stick with my original classification of this sentence being grammatically correct.
0	In Italian, when referring to people in the past tense using third-person singular or plural verbs (like "uccise" which means "killed"), it requires that the subject must also be explicitly stated. Therefore, without knowing the gender of both individuals mentioned in the sentence ("Leonardo" and "Andrea"), we cannot determine the correct form of the pronoun to use as the subject. For instance, if they were both male, the sentence would have been: "Egli uccise Andrea." If they were both female, the sentence would have been: "Ella uccise Andrea." However, since no pronoun appears before "Leonardo", the sentence remains ungrammatical due to an ambiguous reference to its subject.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, the verb "ha" (third person singular form of "avere", meaning "has") agrees with the subject "Andrea". Also, word order in Italian can change for emphasis or clarity; here "che Tommaso lo guarda" is emphasized as new information at the end of the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is a singular masculine noun that takes the third person singular form of the verb "ha". "Voglia" means desire or wish, which agrees with "Gabriele" in number (singular) and gender (masculine). Therefore, it is appropriate to use "ha" here as the helping verb for the main verb "voglia". Overall, the sentence translates to "Gabriele wants to go to the sea."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used here as a singular form of the third person pronoun (he/she) followed by the verb "questo" which means "this." "Libro" is a masculine noun that agrees with "questo," while "che" introduces a relative clause. "Non avevo mai letto" translates to "had never read." Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated to English as "It is this book that I had never read before."
0	In Italian, when using "da" (meaning "from") before a masculine singular noun that refers to a person, you need to use "quel" as an article. However, in this case, "professor" is a masculine plural noun, so the correct form would be "quei." Therefore, the sentence "Da quel professore, Tommaso non è stato ancora interrogato?" is grammatically incorrect. It should be "Quei professori, Tommaso non è stato ancora interrogato?" or, more appropriately, "Quelli professori, Tommaso non è stato ancora interrogato?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (a masculine singular noun) is the subject that believes something, while "invaderemo" (a first person plural verb in future tense) refers to an action that will be performed by multiple people including the speaker. The conjugated form of the verb matches with the number and gender agreement rules for the subject. Therefore, it does not have any grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "A proposito di questi paesi" means "regarding these countries". "Quale" is used correctly as an interrogative adjective to ask which one. "Crede" agrees in number with the subject "Andrea", so it is also used correctly. Therefore, I would say that overall the sentence is acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "L'anno scorso" means "last year," "Alessandro" is the subject who was writing a book last year, "ma tutt'oggi" means "but until today," and "non l'ha ancora finito" means "he hasn't finished it yet." The verb conjugations agree with their respective subjects in number and tense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Last year, Edoardo wrote a book, but so far he hasn't finished it yet." The use of "l'ha" (short for "lo ha") is correct as the direct object ("un libro") was mentioned before in the same sentence.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect because "Gabriele" cannot simultaneously be both "single" (scapolo) and "married" (sposato). It would have to be either one or the other.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "L'attuale re di Francia" means "the current king of France," which is singular and agrees with the third-person singular verb form "è" (is). The statement that the current king of France is bald might not be factually accurate, but that doesn't make the grammar wrong.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Qualche" means "some," which refers to an unspecified quantity or number of students (plural subject). "Studenti" also agrees with the plural subject. "Ha superato" is conjugated correctly for the third person singular verb form, referring back to "qualche studente." Finally, "l'esame" is the direct object of the sentence, so it is grammatically correct to include the definite article before "esame." Overall, the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules and is acceptable as written.
0	The sentence is incorrect due to redundancy in negation. In Italian uses double negatives to express negative meaning, but they must not cancel each other out. Here, "non" cancels out with another "non", resulting in an affirmative statement which does not make sense in context. It would be better to say "Se qualche studente non ha superato l'esame, allora nessun studente ha superato l'esame." (If some student did not pass the exam, then no students passed the exam.)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ieri" means "yesterday", "ho promesso" means "promised", "a" is a preposition that can mean "to" or "for," depending on context, "Lorenzo" is the name of a person, and "di partire" means "to leave." So the entire sentence means "Yesterday I promised Lorenzo to leave."
1	The sentence "Nel processo di primo grado, la corte dichiarò l'imputato innocente." is grammatically correct. It means "In the first degree trial, the court declared the defendant not guilty" in English. Here, "la corte" (the court) is singular feminine gender noun which agrees with its adjective "dichiarò" (declared). Similarly, "l'imputato" (the defendant) is also a singular masculine gender noun that matches with its adjective "innocente" (not guilty).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Continua" (meaning "continue") is the second person singular informal form of the verb, which matches with the implied subject ("you"). "Così" means "like this", "e" is used as a conjunction here meaning "and", and "combinerai" is the second person singular informal future tense of the verb "combinare" (to combine), referring again to an implied "you". Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated into English as "Keep it up and you will get into trouble."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular present tense form of the verb "avere" (to have), while "preso" is its past participle. Together they mean "I have taken." "Le chiavi" means "the keys," so the whole sentence translates to "IOS as "I have taken the keys."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Andrea" is the subject who transmits (trasmettendoci) the marchioness's commissions ("le commissioni della marchesa"). Since it is singular, we use the third person singular form "ha detto." * The quotation marks indicate that what follows is something said by someone else (the marchesa). Therefore, the verb tense can differ from the preceding context. In this case, the marchesa uses the second person plural form "darete," which agrees with the implied plural audience ("loro") in her statement.
0	The sentence "Una bella casa fa comodo" is grammatically incorrect in Italian. The adjective "bello" must agree with the noun it modifies, which is feminine singular here (casa), so it should be "bella". However, even after fixing that mistake, the sentence would still not make sense, as one needs to specify what or who finds the house comfortable ("comodo"). A possible corrected version could be: "Una bella casa è sempre comoda per chi ci abita." (A beautiful house is always comfortable for those living in it.)
1	The sentence "Prendiamo questo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Let's take this." In Italian, when using the first person plural form (we) with present tense verbs that end in -are, you add "-amo". Therefore, "prendere" becomes "prendiamo", which makes the sentence correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "il" (masculine singular) instead of "la" or "le" (plural) for the noun "gladio" which is masculine but plural in this context. So the corrected form would be "Uso le spade."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il calcolatore" means "the calculator", and "funziona bene" means "works well". So, the complete sentence translates to "The calculator works well."
1	The sentence "I am here." is grammatically correct. In English, verbs must agree in number (singular or plural) with their subject. Here, the subject "I" is singular and so is its verb "am". Additionally, the word order is also correct as it follows the standard SVO structure in English where the subject comes first, followed by the verb and finally the object.
0	This sentence contains two errors in double negatives. In English grammar, using both a negative verb form (don't) and a negative pronoun or adverb (no) creates an error as it implies a positive meaning. A correct version would be "She doesn't have any pets" or simply "She has no pets".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il libro che mi ha prestato Lorenzo" means "The book that Lorenzo lent me." It is in past tense, as shown by the use of "ha prestato". The subject of the second part of the sentence, "non mi piace", which means "I don't like it," agrees with its singular verb form "piace". Overall, the structure and grammar are correct for what seems to be an opinion about a book borrowed from someone else.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Dicono" (they say) agrees with multiple speakers in the third person plural form. "Che hai raccontato" (that you told) follows the direct speech structure required for reporting what someone else said. "Che non ci vediamo mai" (that we never see each other) correctly uses the negated first person plural verb form "vediamo." Overall, the sentence demonstrates proper syntax, agreement, and word order.
0	The sentence "Legge velocemente" is incomplete and lacks context. It would be difficult to determine its grammaticality without additional information about who or what is performing the action. Additionally, it appears that the subject of the sentence is missing, which makes it grammatically incorrect as a standalone statement.
0	This sentence is incorrect because it mixes formal and informal forms of address. "Andando" and "ho incontrato" are in the formal second person singular form (Lei), while "tuo" is an informal possessive adjective (your). It would be more appropriate to use either all formal or all informal language throughout the sentence. For instance, one could say "Andando a casa, ho incontrato il tuo fratello," which uses all informal language, or "Andando a casa, ha incontrato il suo fratello," which uses all formal language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sto" is a contraction of "sto" + present participle "-ndo", indicating that the action (andare) is currently being performed. "A prendere" means "to pick up". So, overall it means "I am going to pick up the car."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Non è vero" means "it is not true," while "che l'aspetto dei luoghi cambia come il volto degli uomini" means "that the appearance of places changes like the face of men." So the whole sentence negates the idea that locations change their looks as often or dramatically as people do.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a clear subject and verb conjugation that matches the intended meaning. "Va'" means "he/she goes" in Italian, but since we don't know who is going, we need to specify it or use a more general form such as "vanno," which means "they go." Additionally, "casa" needs an article before it (such as "la casa" for "the house"). A better way to say "Let's go home!" could be "Andiamo a casa!" with "andiamo" being the first-person plural present tense of the verb "andare" ("to go") and "a casa" meaning "to/at home".
0	The sentence "Io sono affamato" is incorrect because "affamato" (which means hungry) must agree in number with the subject. In this case, the subject ("io") is singular, but "affamato" is also singular, while it needs to be its plural form, which is "affamati". So the correct sentence would be "Io sono affamato**i**."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Bravo" can be used as an exclamation to express approval or admiration for someone's actions or qualities. In this case, it is being used to praise the boy.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "è". The rest of the sentence provides more information about the subject using the relative pronoun "che", which refers back to "Paola".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "What are you doing tomorrow?" in English. In informal contexts, Italians often omit the subject pronoun as it can be understood from the verb conjugation.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" is used as an auxiliary verb for the past tense, which agrees with the subject "io" (I). "Visto" is the past participle that agrees with the direct object "il libro" (the book) due to it being masculine singular. Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gli" is the appropriate form of the definite article for masculine plural nouns, which agrees with the noun "amici." Additionally, "il cui" is the correlative expression that means "whose," agreeing in gender (masculine) and number (singular) with the following word "maestro." Finally, "è" is an auxiliary verb that must always precede the subject when using the passive voice or introducing relative clauses, as it does here. Therefore, the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Credo" means "I believe," "che" is a conjunction used here to introduce a subordinate clause, and "tu abbia ragione" is the second part of the sentence which translates as "you are right." So overall it means "I believe you are right."
0	In Italian, reflexive verbs require that the subject matches the object in number (singular or plural). Here, "si è fatto male" translates as "he hurt himself," but since the subject is "siccome è caduto" ("because he fell"), it requires a singular form for both parts of the verb. Therefore, the correct form would be "si è fatto male" only when referring to one person; otherwise, you need to use "si sono fatti male." So, the corrected version should read: "Siccome è caduto, si è fatto male." vs. "Siccome sono caduti, si sono fatti male."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Volevano" (which means "they wanted") matches with the plural subject "Masha and Jane", and "l'hanno distrutta" correctly uses the plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere" ("have") in the compound past tense "distruggere". Therefore, this sentence follows all the rules of Italian grammar.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ognuno" means "each one", so it requires the singular form "suo". It would only be incorrect if "ognuno" were replaced with a plural noun or pronoun (in which case you would use "loro").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Prendimi" means "take me", "quell'aggeggio" means "that gadget". It's important to note that even though "aggeggio" is an informal term for something small or unimportant, it can still be used appropriately depending on context.
0	In standard English grammar, we use "doesn't" instead of "don't" after he, she, or it (third person singular pronoun) in the present tense. Therefore, the sentence "She don't want to play with me" is incorrect, as it uses "don't" instead of "doesn't". A grammatically correct version would be "She doesn't want to play with me."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria uses the computer, I don't know how to do it." Here's why: "Maria" is the subject and she is using the computer, which is expressed by "usa". "Io" means "I", and the negation is correctly written as "non lo so fare". "lo" refers back to "il computer" (the computer) "so" is an auxiliary verb that indicates knowing something "fare" is what one does with computers, but since it is part of a negative form here, we use its infinitive tense "fare".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" means "I have," which agrees with the first-person singular subject pronoun "I." "Visto" is the past participle form of the verb "vedere," meaning "to see." It also agrees with the subject in number and gender (masculine singular). Finally, "una casa" is a correctly formed noun phrase consisting of the indefinite article "una" followed by its associated noun "casa," which translates as "a house."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular form of the present tense of the verb "avere," which means "to have." "Visto" is the past participle used with "avere." Together they make up the compound past tense that indicates an action completed at some point in the past. So, "Ho visto" translates as "I have seen."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La persona" means "the person," so it is in agreement with the singular verb form "mi ha parlato." This phrase can mean "The person who spoke to me."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Se uno va in treno, vuole stare comodo" can be translated as "If one goes by train, they want to be comfortable". In Italian, when referring to an unspecified person with "one", it is common to use the singular form for both verbs (va, vuole), even though "they" would typically require a plural verb conjugation in English.
0	The sentence "Fa male la mia testa" is incorrect in standard Italian because it lacks an auxiliary verb to form the compound past tense (passato prossimo). A more appropriate way to express "My head hurts" would be "Mi fa male la testa." Here, "mi" is a reflexive pronoun that indicates that the subject experiences the action of the verb ("fa male," which means "hurts").
0	The sentence "Ho due case" is incorrect because it uses the wrong verb form for "avere" (to have) in the first person singular ("ho") with a plural subject ("due case," or two houses). Instead, the correct verb form would be "abbiamo." Therefore, the corrected sentence should read as follows: "Abbiamo due case."
0	The sentence "I have houses" in Italian would translate as "Io ho case", not "Ho delle case". In addition, it is important to note that "delle" is used with feminine singular nouns, so using it before "case" (plural) is also incorrect.
1	The sentence "Il cavallo è arrivato prima." is grammatically correct. In Italian, the gender of the horse (il cavallo) is masculine and "prima" means "first". Therefore, it implies that one male horse arrived first. However, if we were referring to more than one horse, we would have used "i cavalli" in place of "il cavallo", but for the given sentence, everything looks good.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I cavalli" means "the horses" in English and it agrees with the singular verb form "è resistanti". However, since "cavalli" is already plural, the correct singular form would have been "è un animale resistente." Nonetheless, the given sentence does not contain any grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È venuto" means "has come", while "qualcuno" means "someone". So the whole sentence can be translated as "Someone has come." In Italian, it is common to use singular verb forms even when referring to an unknown or unspecified number of people (as long as they share the same subject).
0	The sentence "È arrivato" is incorrect because it uses the singular masculine form of the verb "arrivare," which means "to arrive." However, since we don't know who arrived, we need more context or information about the subject. If the subject is male and singular, the sentence would be correct as is. But in most cases, you will want to use the third person plural form of the verb, which is "Sono arrivati."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Posso" means "I can", which agrees with the singular subject implied in the first person pronoun dropped from the sentence (Italian allows for that). "Venire" is the infinitive form of the verb meaning "to come". So overall, it translates as "I can come."
0	The sentence "Magari domani piove" is incorrect in standard Italian because it lacks a subject. A more complete version of the sentence could be "Forse magari domani pioverà," which means "Maybe it will rain tomorrow." In addition, "magari" can sound informal or colloquiali real life conversation, but its use as an isolated sentence may not convey proper meaning without further context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Lui" (he) refers to a single masculine subject, and "è stato colto" (was caught) agrees in number and gender with "lui." Additionally, "dalla pioggia" (by the rain) is correctly used as the prepositional phrase indicating the cause of being caught.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Write a letter to his aunt." In English, it might seem more natural to say "her" rather than "his," but that is not necessarily the case in all languages.
1	The sentence "Egli lo vide." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He saw him" in English. In this sentence, "egli" is the subject pronoun for third person singular masculine (he), "lo" is the direct object pronoun for third person singular masculine (him) and "vide" is the verb meaning "saw". Therefore, it follows all the rules of grammar properly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (subject) promises "Edoardo" (indirect object) that he will stay at home ("di restare a casa"). All words agree with each other in number and gender, so it's grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject in singular form and "non ha" (does not have) agrees with it. "Tempo" means time and here it is used without an article which is perfectly acceptable in Italian. Therefore, I would say that the sentence "Riccardo non ha tempo." can be translated as "Riccardo doesn't have time".
1	The sentence "Ho riparato il tavolo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "I fixed the table" in English. In this sentence, "ho" is the first person singular present tense form of the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have), which is used with past participle forms of transitive verbs; "riparato" is the past participle of the verb "riparare" (to fix); and "il tavolo" is a masculine singular definite article + noun meaning "the table".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere," which means "have." It agrees with the subject "le ragazze," which is also plural. The rest of the sentence "aperto il libro" translates to "opened the book," where "apert" is the past participle that agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of the direct object "libro." Overall, the entire sentence correctly follows the rules of agreement between verbs and their corresponding subjects or objects.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Le" is used as an indirect object pronoun in feminine plural form, referring to multiple female recipients (in this case, presumably more than one person). "È" is the third-person singular verb for "to be," which agrees with the subject of the sentence, "il cappello." Lastly, "da me" means "from me," indicating that the speaker gave the hat to them.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quel" means "that" or "which," referring to a specific boy being mentioned; "ragazzo" means "boy." "Aprire" means "to open," which is conjugated correctly for the third person masculine singular (he). Finally, "la porta" means "the door." So, the sentence translates to "That boy opens the door." If you meant to refer to multiple boys opening the door, it would need to say "Quei ragazzi aprono le porte" with quei meaning those, ragazzi as boys (plural), aprono as open (they) and le porte as the doors (feminine, plural).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular present tense form of the verb "avere," which means "to have." "Sentito" is the past participle of the same verb, used here as an auxiliary verb to indicate that the action happened in the past. "Cantare" is the infinitive form of the verb "cantare," meaning "to sing." Finally, "i ragazzi" is the plural masculine noun for "the boys." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "I heard (the) boys singing."
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in Italian. A more appropriate way to phrase it would be "La macchina vuole che lui la lavi" or "Lui deve lavare la macchina," depending on what you want to express. In both cases, "lui" (he) needs to come before the infinitive verb form ("lavare") for grammatical agreement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" (third person singular form of "to be") agrees with its subject "il meccanico" (the mechanic). Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in the given sentence.
0	This sentence is incorrect due to two reasons. Firstly, "venire" needs to agree with its subject in number and person; thus, it should be changed to "venite". Secondly, the word order is not quite right - negated infinitives usually come before their affirmative counterparts. So, the corrected version would be: "Non venire fino a Napoli è quello che non voglio."
0	This sentence is incorrect because it lacks proper context. "Quanto al bagno" means "as for the bathroom," but the second part of the sentence doesn't complete the thought in a coherent way. If you want to say something positive about the bathroom, you could use "Mi piace il bagno." or "Il bagno è bello." depending on what exactly you want to express.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Hai presente" means "Do you remember?" and "Lorenzo" is the object being referred to. So the question is asking if the listener remembers Lorenzo.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing a subject. A proper question in Italian requires an explicit or implicit subject. For instance, "Lei da quando **vive** in America?" (She when did she live in America?) would be correct with emphasis on the verb form "vive" indicating that we are asking about her living arrangements. If you want to ask generally, use "Quando..." as in "Quand'è che lei vive in America?" which translates to When does she live in America?.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Credi" (you believe) agrees with its subject, which is singular in this case. "Una cosa del genere" (something like that) is what follows "che" (that), so it doesn't affect the agreement between "credi" and its subject.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Appena detto ciò" means "as soon as I said that". "Mi lasciò" means "he left me", where "mi" is a reflexive pronoun in first person singular and "lasciò" is the third conjugation of the verb "lasciare" (to leave) in simple past tense. "Che piangevo" is a relative clause meaning "that I was crying", with "che" acting as a relativizer. Finally, "volevo dire molte cose" means "I wanted to say many things", with "volevo" being the imperfect form of the verb "volere" (to want). Therefore, the overall structure of the sentence can be translated into English as follows: "As soon as I said that, he left me while I was crying and I wanted to say many things."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "You are always the same: a loyal, patient, and honest friend." The subject of the sentence is informal singular you ("tu"), which remains constant throughout the sentence. The verb "sei" agrees with the subject, as does the adjective "fidato," which must agree in gender (masculine) and number (singular) with its noun "amico." Similarly, the adjectives "paziente" and "onesto" agree with their respective nouns "amico" and "amico" in gender (masculine) and number (singular). Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Il vento forte sul mare può provocare mareggiate." is grammatically correct. It means "A strong wind over the sea can cause stormy seas," where "vento" refers to the wind, "forte" describes it as being strong, "mare" refers to the sea, "può provocare" indicates that it can cause something, and "mareggiate" describes the resulting condition of the sea (stormy or rough). All grammar rules appear to have been followed correctly in this sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject in agreement with the verb "piangere" (to cry). In Italian, verbs must agree in number and person with their subjects. Therefore, a proper subject needs to be stated before the verb. For instance, a possible correction could be "Lei piange forte." (She cries loudly) or "Loro piangono forte." (They cry loudly), depending on who you want to refer to as crying loudly.
1	The sentence "Ho preso in casa una specie di gatto." is grammatically correct. It means "I took home a type of cat" or more naturally, "I brought home a kind of cat". However, it would sound more natural to say "Un gatto della specie X ho portato a casa.", where X is the species of the cat.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ho" is the first person singular form of the present tense verb "avere" (to have), "preso" is the past participle used with "avere," and "dello zucchero" means "some sugar." So the whole sentence translates as "I have had some sugar."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Non" means "no" or "not," "mi" is a reflexive pronoun that indicates that the speaker does not like something for themselves, "piaccere" is an impersonal verb meaning "to please" or "to be pleasing to." So "non mi piace" can be translated as "I don't like it." Finally, "il vino" simply means "the wine." Therefore, the sentence "Non mi piace il vino" can be translated as "I don't like (the) wine."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Che" refers to what you are selling, "vendo" means sell, and "merce cinese" means Chinese goods or merchandise. So, the translation of "Quel che vendo è merce cinese." is "What I am selling is Chinese merchandise."
0	The sentence "Mettere fretta" is not grammatically correct in Italian. It seems that it is missing an object or verb. A possible correction could be "Mettere fretta (a qualcuno)" which means "To put pressure (on someone)".
1	The sentence "È stato bandito un concorso." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means that "a competition has been announced" or "a contest has been organized". The subject-verb agreement is also correct here as "è stato" (third person singular) agrees with its singular subject "un concorso" (a competition).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Balena" means whale, so "Tutte le balene" translates to "All the whales". Since we are referring to all whales (plural), "devono" which agrees with the plural subject is used instead of "dovrebbe", which would agree with a singular subject.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses the imperative mood (a command) but lacks an explicit subject "tu" (you). To make it grammatically correct, you can either include "tu" at the beginning or use a more formal form such as "Lei" or "Loro". For example: Tu mettilo bene in capo. (informal) Lei metta bene in capo. (singular formal) Loro mettano bene in capo. (plural formal)
0	The sentence "Questa macchina è vecchia ma nuova" is grammatically incorrect in Italian because you cannot use "vecchia" (feminine singular form) and "nuova" (feminine singular form) together to describe one thing. Instead, it would be appropriate to say "questa macchina è vecchia pero nuovissima" or "questa macchina è un po' vecchia ma anche molto nuova".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" (subject) does not know "Maria" (object). Therefore, it is acceptable to say "Leonardo non conosce Maria."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il governo" means "the government," while "ha abolito" is the third person singular form of the verb "abolire" (to abolish), which agrees with the subject "il governo." Finally, "la legge" means "the law," making the complete translation: "The government has abolished the law."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le" is used as an indirect object pronoun referring to "gli occhiali" (the glasses). It agrees with the feminine plural noun it refers to.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is a singular masculine noun that means Thomas in English. "Abita" is the third person present indicative form of the verb "abitare," which means "to live." Therefore, "Tommaso abita da dieci anni" can be translated as "Thomas has lived there for ten years."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" (subject) is in third person singular form and agrees with the verb "ha dato" which also appears in third person singular form. Additionally, both nouns "libro" and "Sofia", appearing as direct object and indirect object respectively, are correctly declined in singular form.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is a singular feminine subject that takes the third person singular form of the verb "ha," which means "has." The phrase "corso per ore" translates to "ran for hours" in English. Therefore, overall, the translation is "Maria ran for hours."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (masculine singular) agrees with "ha bevuto" (third person singular verb conjugated for masculine gender), while "un caffè" (a coffee) matches with the singular quantity indicated by "un." Therefore, the subject-verb agreement and article-noun agreement are both consistent here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is a third-person singular masculine subject, so the present tense verb "ha trovato" (has found) agrees with it. Additionally, the direct object "un biglietto" (a ticket) uses the singular form since only one ticket was found. Overall, the structure and grammar rules follow standard Italian language conventions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject and "sta compilando" means "is filling out". So, the whole sentence translates to "Edoardo is filling out", which makes sense and follows all the rules of Italian grammar.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject in the sentence. Also, "emanare" requires an object to follow it (the thing that is being emitted). A possible correction could be "La torta emana un buon profumo." which means "The cake emits a good smell".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "To open a new store" or "Opening a new shop." There is no grammatical error in it.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject in agreement with the verb "iniziare". A proper Italian sentence requires a clear subject-verb agreement. For instance, one could say "Io inizio un'attività" (I start an activity) or "Loro iniziano un'attività" (They start an activity), depending on the intended meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La porta" means "the door," while "si è chiusa" can be translated as "has closed." Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "The door has closed" which makes sense and follows proper grammar rules for Italian language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "ammette" agrees with it in number (singular) and gender (masculine). Additionally, the phrase "di essere preso in giro" correctly uses the passive form of the verb "prendere". Therefore, the sentence is acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is a singular third-person feminine subject in Italian, so using "ha" as the auxiliary verb for the simple past tense agrees with it correctly. Additionally, "restituito" matches the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of "libro." Therefore, no grammatical errors exist in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It translates to "What did (s)he take?" or "What has (s)he taken?" depending on the context. In Italian, you can use either "ha" or "è" as an auxiliary verb for past perfect tense; both are acceptable but have slightly different meanings. Here, using "ha" implies that the action was completed at some point in the past, while "è" would imply that the result of the action still holds true in the present.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le" refers to direct object pronoun for feminine, plural nouns, which agrees with the subject "scarpe." "Si" indicates reflexive action (themselves), and "sono" is third-person plural of the verb "to be," agreeing with the subject "scarpe." Overall, it means "The shoes have gotten dirty."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Le giornate" (the days) is the subject and agrees with the singular verb form "si è accorciata". However, it would have been more appropriate to use the plural verb form "si sono accorciate", since "giornate" is already plural, for consistency in number agreement between subject and verb. Nonetheless, the given sentence remains grammatically acceptable as it stands.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Qualcosa" (something) is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "ha accorciato" (has shortened). The object of the sentence is "le giornate" (the days), which is correctly linked with the appropriate definite article "le". Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Qualcuno" (someone) is the subject and it agrees with the past participle "accorciato" (shortened). Also, the singular form of "le giornate" (the days) as direct object is appropriate here since only an unspecified person ("qualcuno") is implied to have performed the action.
0	This sentence is incomplete and lacks proper context for evaluation of grammaticality. Additionally, it appears to be written in Italian, which I am not proficient at evaluating. However, even without knowing the intended meaning or full context, "aggrapparsi" requires an object (such as "un ramo", but by itself it would still be incomplete).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Arenatesi" means "ran aground", and it agrees with its subject "le navi" (the ships). "Gli equipaggi" (the crews) also matches its verb form "sono scesi" (have come down), which is conjugated for third person plural. Therefore, both parts of the sentence match their respective subjects in number and gender, making it correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La nebbia" (the fog) is feminine singular in Italian, so it requires the verb form "è" (third person singular of "essere", to be). Therefore, "la nebbia è svanita" means "the fog has disappeared".
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Alessandro si piagne sempre" rather than "Alessandro si piange sempre". In Italian, "piangere" (to cry) requires the first person singular form "piango", not the third person singular reflexive pronoun "piange".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject, "si" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject, and "lagna" means "to complain." The phrase "sempre" means "always," so this sentence can be translated as "Riccardo always complains about himself."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alle" is used as a contraction for "a le," which means "to her." "Sue" refers to something that belongs to the feminine singular noun it modifies, in this case, "parole" (words). "Maria" is the subject of the sentence, and "ha annuito" indicates that she nodded in response.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'acqua" means "the water," while "sgorgare" means "to gush or flow suddenly." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "The water gushed out unexpectedly" in English.
1	The sentence "Andrea ha sbadigliato?" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Did Andrea yawn?" in English. Here, "ha" is an auxiliary verb used with the past participle "sbadigliato" (yawned) to form a question in the simple past tense. So, no correction needed for this sentence.
1	The sentence "Riccardo pedala" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows standard subject-verb agreement rules. Here, "Riccardo" (masculine singular) is the subject and "pedala" (third person singular present tense conjugation for the verb "to cycle") matches the subject. So no corrections needed here!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used here as an auxiliary verb for the compound past tense (passato prossimo). It agrees with the subject, which is singular in this case. "Appropriato" means "took advantage of", so the whole sentence can be translated into English as "He took advantage of the experience".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Francesco's son sits in the front row at 8 o'clock sharp." Each word follows standard Italian grammar rules for conjugation and syntax.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "When the concert began, Leo's son was sitting in the front row." In Italian, when referring to someone else's child, you can use "il figlio/la figlia" followed by the father or mother's name.
0	This sentence is not grammatically acceptable in Italian because "giornata" (day) is feminine singular but it agrees with the verb "ammuffisce" as if it were masculine singular. It would need to agree with the gender and number of the subject ("il muro", which is masculine singular). A grammatically correct version could be: "Il muro ammuffisce in un giorno."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject and the verb "sta suonando" agrees with it in number (singular) and tense (present continuous). The object of the sentence is "un pezzo di Bach", which means "a piece by Bach". Overall, the structure of the sentence and word choices are appropriate for the intended meaning.
1	The sentence "Il coro canta molto bene." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The choir sings very well" in English. Here, "il coro" (the choir) is the subject which agrees with the singular verb form "canta" (sings). Additionally, "molto bene" means very well, further modifying the verb "canta". Hence, it's an acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) aspires always for the smoke ("fumo") of the cigar ("sigaro").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is the subject and "aspira" means "aspire". "A" is a preposition that introduces the infinitive verb phrase "diventare medico", which means "to become a doctor". So, the entire sentence translates to "Andrea aspires to become a doctor."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Lorenzo" is a third-person singular masculine noun in Italian, so the verb that follows it must agree with its subject in number (singular) and gender (masculine). In this case, "non ha cucinato" means "did not cook," which agrees with the singular masculine noun "Lorenzo." Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
0	The verb "scrive" does not agree with its subject "la lettera," which is feminine singular. Since "lettera" is singular, the corresponding third-person singular form of the verb must be used. In this case, it would be "scriv**e**." Therefore, the grammatically correct version would be: "La lettera scrive."
0	The sentence appears to contain a question mark at the end but does not begin with a capitalized word or include any recognizable subject-verb agreement. It also uses an Italian word "Disturbo" which doesn't make sense in English context. A complete and proper rephrasing would be necessary for evaluation as a grammatical sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject and it agrees with the verb form "sta compilano." The sentence means "Leonardo is filling out (something)."
1	The sentence "Riccardo non scrive più da un pezzo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo hasn't written for a while" in English.
1	The sentence "Il macchinista si è fermato." is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "The train driver stopped himself" or more naturally "The train driver stopped". Si here is used as a reflexive pronoun which refers back to il machinista (the train driver). È is the third person singular form of essere (to be) that agrees with il machinista. Therefore, the verb conjugation for sich ("si è") matches with the subject il machinista.
0	The sentence is incomplete and lacks a main verb, which makes it ungrammatical. A complete version could be "I negozianti hanno aumentato i prezzi" (The shopkeepers have increased prices).
1	The sentence "I bicchieri si sono rotti." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The glasses have broken" or more literally "The glasses themselves have broken". In this case, "si" is used as an impersonal reflexive pronoun, which refers back to the subject "bicchieri", indicating that they acted upon themselves.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is a singular feminine noun that requires the use of "ha" (the third person singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere," meaning "to have") as its conjugated helping verb. Additionally, "il fuoco" means "the fire," which is also grammatically correct. Therefore, I would rate this sentence as grammatical.
1	The sentence "Il soggiorno in Canada ha migliorato il suo inglese." is grammatically correct. Here's why: * "Soggiorno" (stay) is correctly used as a noun here. * "In Canada" specifies where the stay took place. * "Ha migliorato" means "has improved," which is the verb tense that agrees with the subject. * "Il suo inglese" refers to his or her English language skills, which were improved by the stay in Canada. Overall, the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules for word usage, agreement between verbs and their subjects, and punctuation.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "La lezione" means "the lesson," and "ha continuato" is the third-person singular form of the verb "continuare" (to continue), which agrees with its subject "la lezione."
0	The sentence "Saltare un ostacolo" is in Italian and it translates to "Jump over an obstacle." However, the sentence structure is incorrect as it lacks a subject (the one who jumps). A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Egli salta un ostacolo," which means "He jumps over an obstacle." Therefore, I am marking this sentence as incorrect due to its missing subject.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses an objective pronoun ("them") as the subject of the sentence, which requires a subject pronoun such as "they". Additionally, the verb tense needs to agree with the number and person of the subject; in this case, since "they" implies multiple people or things, we need to use a third-person plural form of the verb rather than the singular form used here (have). A possible corrected version could be: They have three apples.
0	The sentence "Si è macchiata la tovaglia" is incorrect because it uses the reflexive pronoun "si" with the singular past tense form "è," but the subject "la tovaglia" (the tablecloth) is feminine singular and requires a third-person singular verb form such as "si è macchiata." Therefore, the correct sentence would be "La tovaglia si è macchiata."
0	The sentence "Macchia il vino" is incorrect in Italian because it lacks proper subject-verb agreement. In this case, the verb "macchiare" (to stain) requires an object ("il vino", the wine), but there is no explicit subject. Moreover, even with an added subject, the singular form "macchia" would need to change based on the number of the subject; for instance, "Lui macchia il vino" means "He stains the wine," while "Essi macchiano il vino" signifies "They stain the wine."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "L'acqua" means "the water", "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "to be," which agrees with its subject "l'acqua." "Gelata" is the past participle that describes the state of being cold or frozen. Therefore, the translation of this sentence would be: "The water will be frozen in two hours."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le tappe" (the stages) is the subject and it agrees with the past participle "bruciato" (burned), which also shows agreement with the feminine plural subject through its ending "-ate". The time expression "per un'ora" (for an hour) correctly follows the verb phrase as expected.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il vetro" means "the glass", while "si rompe" means "breaks". Therefore, the whole sentence translates to "The glass breaks."
1	The sentence "Ha verificato l'autenticità della firma." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence means "He/She verified the authenticity of the signature" in English. In this sentence, "ha verificato" is the third person singular form of the verb "verificare" (to verify) in the passato prossimo tense, which agrees with either he or she as the subject. "L'autenticità" is the subject of the sentence and it is correctly marked by the definite article "l". Finally, "della firma" is the genitive determiner phrase modifying "autenticità", indicating possession.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (a name) is the subject, and "lava" means "washes." "La macchina" means "the car," which is what Riccardo is washing. So, the entire sentence translates to "Riccardo washes the car."
1	The sentence "Paola ha visto la partita con gli amici." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Paola watched the match with her friends." Here, "ha visto" indicates that the action occurred in the past tense. Also, "la partita" refers to "the match," while "con gli amici" translates to "with her friends." Hence, it is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject, "si" refers to himself (it is a reflexive pronoun), "ha tagliato" means "has cut", and "le basette" means "the sideburns". So the whole sentence means "Gabriele has cut his sideburns."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject, followed by the reflexive pronoun "si", which indicates that the action is being performed on oneself. The verb "è tagliato" is conjugated correctly for the masculine singular subject "Riccardo". The direct object "il mento" (the chin) comes next, followed by the preposition "con" and its object "il rasoio" (the razor). Overall, each word is used correctly and follows standard rules for word order and syntax.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Si" here is used as a reflexive pronoun, which agrees with the subject "Francesco". "È" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere", meaning "to be". It also agrees with the subject "Francesco". Therefore, both "si" and "è" agree with their respective subjects in number (singular) and gender (masculine). After that, we have two verbs "calmato" and "irrigidito", which are past participle forms of the verbs "calmare" and "irrigidire". Since they follow the auxiliary verb "essere", these past participles must agree with the subject in gender and number. In our case, since the subject "Francesco" is masculine singular, the past particles must end in "-o": "calmat**o**" and "irrigidit**o**". Hence, the whole sentence "Francesco si è calmato, irrigidito." can be translated into English as "Francisco calmed down, stiffened.", where "calmed down" and "stiffened" are past tense forms corresponding to the past participles "calmat**o**" and "irrigidit**o**".
0	The sentence "Si è rotto il vetro" is incorrect because it uses the singular reflexive pronoun si with the third person singular verb form è (singular) but the subject of the sentence, il vetro (the glass), is singular already so no need for a reflexive pronoun here. It would be better to say just "È rotto il vetro." or if you want to use a reflexive pronoun, you could say "Il vetro si è rotto da solo," which means "The glass broke by itself".
0	This sentence is incorrect in standard Italian because the past participle forms "mangiati" (you all have eaten) and "bevuti" (you all have drunk) do not agree with their corresponding subject pronouns "venite" (you all come). In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, it should say "Venite alla festa mangiando e bevendo" (Come to the party eating and drinking), where the gerund form ("-ndo") is used after the verbs "mangiare" and "bere", which match with the plural subject pronoun "venite".
1	The sentence "Il dibattito è continuato" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The debate continued." In Italian, the verb "continuare" (to continue) agrees with its subject in number and gender. However, since "dibattito" is masculine singular, we use the third person singular form "è continuato".
1	The sentence "Il dibattito ha continuato" is grammatically correct, but it may sound incomplete or lacking context. A more complete version could be "Il dibattito ha continuato fino a tardi," meaning "The debate continued until late." In this case, "ha continuato" serves as an auxiliary verb (avere) followed by the past participle form of the main verb (continuare).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject and "ha cancellato la scritta" means "has erased the writing". So the whole sentence can be translated as "Riccardo has erased the writing."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject and he is performing the action of "suona", which means plays or rings (in this context, it refers to making a sound). The object being played is "il telefono," meaning the telephone. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Leonardo plays the telephone."
1	The sentence "Il livello si è alzato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The level has risen" in English. Here, "il livello" (the level) is the subject of the sentence, while "si è alzato" (has risen) represents the third-person singular verb form that agrees with the gender and number of its subject. Therefore, it's grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is a third person singular masculine subject which matches with the verb form "ha bruciato". Additionally, "la torta" is a singular feminine direct object, which agrees with the past participle "bruciato". Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is a singular masculine noun in Italian, so it requires the verb form "è." In this case, "pentito" agrees with the subject "Edoardo," as both are singular masculine forms. Therefore, the sentence "Edoardo è pentito" translates to "Edoardo is sorry" or "Edoardo repents" in English.
1	The sentence "Il bosco si è bruciato per tre ore." is grammatically correct. This means "The forest burned for three hours," where "si" indicates a reflexive action that does not require an explicit subject. It would also be grammatically correct with an explicit subject (e.g., "Esso si è bruciato per tre ore.", meaning "It burned for three hours.")
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La biancheria" means "the laundry," "si" refers to indirect object agreement with reflexive verbs (in this case, "asciugare" which means "to dry"), and "è asciugata" is the third person singular form of the passive voice of "asciugare." Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "The laundry has dried for an hour" and it follows all grammatical rules of Italian language.
1	The sentence "Il libro è sparito per tre giorni, poi è improvvisamente ricomparso sul mio tavolo." is grammatically correct. It means "The book disappeared for three days, it suddenly reappeared on my table". All words in the sentence are used correctly, including verb conjugations and agreement between subject and verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject and it agrees with the reflexive pronoun "si". The verb "ingrassare" means "to gain weight", and it is used here in its past participle form "ingrassato" which agrees with the subject "Riccardo". Overall, the structure of the sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules for forming simple sentences using a reflexive verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "è." The phrase "ingrassato molto dall'ultima volta che l'ho vista" correctly modifies the subject by describing how much weight he has gained since the last time the speaker saw him.
0	In Italian, when referring to "one hour" with a definite article (in questo caso, "un"), it must agree in gender with the noun it modifies. Here, the noun is "ora," which is feminine, so the correct form would be "una." Thus, the corrected sentence should read: "Si è rotta la televisione in una ora." However, note that Italians usually say "in un'ora e mezzo" ("an hour and a half") for time durations, not just "in un'ora".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alle 8 in punto" means "at eight o'clock sharp", "la sala" refers to "the room", and "si è svuotata" is the third person singular passive form of the verb "svuotare" (to empty), which agrees with the subject "sala".
1	The sentence "Il treno si è un po' fermato." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The train stopped for a little while" in English. In this sentence, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun referring back to "il treno", which is singular and masculine, so it agrees with the past participle form "fermato".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La" (feminine singular definite article) agrees with "camicia" (singular feminine noun), and "è sporca" (is dirty) is the third person singular form of the verb "essere" (to be). So, the subject of the sentence must also be singular which is indeed true as only one shirt can be referred to by "la camicia".
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Ho notati un libro caduto." since the subject "io" (I) is implied but understood in the verb form "ho notato," which requires an auxiliary verb for past participle agreement with the subject. Additionally, "libro" is singular so no change needed here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (a masculine name) is the subject and "conosce" (meaning knows) is the verb that agrees with the singular male subject. "Le strade" (the roads) is the object.
0	This sentence is not grammatically acceptable in Italian. It seems that "Andrea" (masculine singular) is trying to take advantage of "Maria" (feminine singular), but it needs to match in number as well. A possible correction would be "Andrea e Mario approfittano di Maria", meaning "Andrew and Mario take advantage of Mary."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing an auxiliary verb (in Italian, usually "avere" or "essere") before the past participle form of the verb "amare". A correct version could be "Chi **ha** amato Leo(w)ardro?" ("Who has loved Leonard?").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is the subject in singular form, so it requires an third person singular verb which is "è". Also, "il capo" means "the boss", so the whole sentence can be translated as "Francesco is the boss."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Trenta chili" (thirty kilograms) is the subject that was weighed by "Alessandro". Therefore, it uses the singular form "è stato pesato", not the plural form "sono stati pesati."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Mio" means "my", "nonno" means "grandfather", "ha" is the third person singular form of the verb "avere" (to have), "venduto" is the past participle of "venedere" (to sell) and agrees with "nonno", "il" is the definite article for masculine nouns, "suo" means "his", and "podere" means "farm". So the whole sentence translates as "My grandfather sold his farm."
1	The sentence "Due lingue sono parlate da tutti i miei studenti" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Two languages are spoken by all my students". The subject-verb agreement is correct as "due lingue" (two languages) is plural and "sono parlate" (are spoken) also reflects the plural form of the verb.
0	In this sentence, "Otto ore al giorno" (eight hours a day) is the subject that is being studied by Tommaso, so it needs to be in the singular form. Therefore, the verb "sono studi**a**te" should be changed to "è studi**a**to". Also, the word "da" should be replaced with "in", since we use "da" for people or things causing an action and "in" when referring to time spent doing something. So the corrected sentence would be: "Otto ore al giorno è studiato da Tommaso." However, I assume you meant to say that Tommaso studies eight hours a day, which means the correct sentence should be: "Ogni giorno, Tommaso studia otto ore."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject, and "trivella" is the verb in its third person singular form (present tense), which agrees with the singular subject "Alessandro". The direct object follows, which is "questa cosa." Therefore, the structure is acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is the subject and "torna" (which means returns) is the verb in past tense that agrees with the singular masculine subject "Tommaso". The preposition "da" indicates where Tommaso is coming from ("Roma").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is the subject and takes the third person singular form of the verb, which is "macina". The phrase "il caffè" means "the coffee", which is what Francesco is grinding using "un vecchio macinino", meaning "an old hand mill for coffee beans". So, overall, it makes sense as a complete sentence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Each verb agrees with its subject in number and gender (Tommaso - masculine singular; rubò - third person singular masculine preterite tense; il portafoglio - masculine singular definite article + masculine singular noun; a Maria - indirect object pronoun "a" followed by feminine singular name; in un autobus - in a bus).
0	In Italian, when asking a question using an auxiliary verb (such as "dove" in this case), it needs to agree with the subject in number and gender. Here, the singular masculine form "dovo" is used, while the subject ("Riccardo") is third person singular masculine. It should be changed to "dov'è" for agreement with the subject. Also, the word order should be adjusted slightly so that the sentence reads more naturally: "Dov'è che Riccardo ha messo la cassa nel mobile?" or simply "Dov'ha messo la cassa Riccardo?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lo scoglio" means "the reef" or "the rock," while "affiora" is its third-person singular present indicative form, meaning "emerges." So, the complete thought expressed by the sentence is that one specific reef or rock emerges (from water).
1	The sentence "Andrea si comporta" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrea behaves (himself)". The verb "comportare" agrees with its subject "Andrea", which is singular. In general, when using reflexive verbs such as "comportare," it is important that the form of the verb matches the number and gender of the subject, but in this case, everything seems fine!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject and "sottrae" is the verb that agrees with it in number and person. "La penna" is the direct object of the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (masculine singular) is the subject that performs an action on the direct object "il giornale" (the newspaper). In English, it would translate as "Lorenzo takes the newspaper out of the safe."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject and he is doing an action "reads" (legge) with the object being "a book" (un libro). He does it "in bed" which is expressed by preposition "a".
0	The sentence contains an error where "the" is used instead of "il." In Italian, definite articles must agree with the gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural) of the noun they modify. Since "tazzina" is feminine singular, the correct form of the article would be "la," making the corrected sentence "Riccardo beve il the nella tazzina di porcellana." However, even with that correction made, it still wouldn't make sense as "the" isn't appropriate here. It seems the intended meaning was for Riccardo to drink something from the cup, so perhaps a more accurate sentence could be "Riccardo beve il caffè dalla tazzina di porcellana" which means "Riccardo drinks coffee from a china cup."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "Dove" (where) needs to agree in number with what it refers to. In this case, it seems that you want to ask where ANDREA took a cigarette, so the question should be "Dov'è che Andrea ha preso una sigaretta?" or just "Dov'è Andrea?" if you only want to know where Andrea is.
0	In Italian, third person singular verbs require "esso", "essa" or "é" as their endings depending on the gender (male, female, or masculine or feminine nouns respectively). However, in the given sentence, "estrarre" which means "to draw out or extract" requires an ending that matches with its subject's gender but it uses "-e". Thus, making the sentence ungrammatical. A correct version could be "Tommaso estrae la pistola nel bar." for masculine singular or "Leila estrae la pistola nel bar." for feminine singular. If more than one person draws out a pistol, we would say "Tommaso e Leila estraggono le pistole nel bar.", using the plural form of the verb since both subjects are multiple.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, "ci" can serve as both an indirect object pronoun (to us) and a locative particle indicating place where the action occurs. Here it seems that "ci" functions as the latter one, hence the sentence means "Riccardo eats rice for us".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) supports or holds ("sostiene") "la lastra" (direct object). In this case, "vi" is an indirect object pronoun referring to someone being supported by Tommaso, which can be either singular or plural depending on context. However, without additional context it cannot be determined with certainty who or what "vi" refers to.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) took ("prese") the history book ("il libro di storia") from ("dalla") the library ("libreria"). All words fit correctly into their respective roles, making it an acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject who takes ("prende") the book ("il libro") from ("dalla") the library room ("sala della biblioteca"). All words agree in number (singular) and tense (present), making it a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject, "mette" means "puts", "le casse" means "the speakers", "sul" means "on", "ripiano" means "tray" or "shelf", and "del montacarichi" means "of the lift". So overall it means "Gabriele puts the speakers on the tray of the lift."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Where did you put the pictures of Francesco?" The verb "hai" (second person singular informal form of "have") agrees with the subject "you." The question word "dove" ("where") indicates that it is an interrogative sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" is the subject and he (singular) is removing money from the drawer. The verb "toglie" agrees with the singular subject Tommaso.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The key is in the hole." In Italian, adjectives often come after the noun they modify and agree with the noun in gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). Here, both "la chiave" (the key, fem sing) and "la toppa" (the hole, fem sing) agree with each other and their respective articles, making it a grammatically sound sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Dal giardino alla strada" means "from the garden to the street", "Lorenzo" is the subject who performed the action (piantare - to plant), "vi" is an indirect object pronoun referring to a group that includes the listener or readers, and "ha piantato i fiori" means "has planted the flowers". Therefore, it can be translated as "From the garden to the street, Lorenzo has planted the flowers for you."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (the subject) agrees with the verb form "ha lanciato" (third person singular), indicating that one person performed the action. Additionally, all other elements of the sentence appear correctly constructed according to standard Italian grammar rules.
0	In Italian, when using "al" (which means "to the" in English), it needs to be preceded by an article ("il", "lo", "la", or "l'" before a vowel) that agrees with the gender and number of the following noun. Here, "garage" is masculine singular, so we need "al gar**a**ge". Also, "dal giardino" implies movement from the garden, but the verb "ha piantato" does not indicate motion. We might want to use something like "Dalla cassetta di semi nel giardino, Leonardo ha piantato fiori anche al garage." This translates as: "From the seed packet in the garden, Leonardo also planted flowers at the garage."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) carries out the action ("carica") which applies to the direct object "le casse" and the indirect object "sulla nave". Therefore, all elements fit together well syntactically, making it an acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La scala" means "the ladder", "poggia" is the third-person singular verb form of "porre" which means "to place or put", and "contro" is a preposition meaning "against". Therefore, the entire sentence translates to "The ladder leans against the wall."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I rivoltosi" means "the rebels", which is the subject of the sentence, and it agrees with the verb form "incarcerarono," meaning "they imprisoned." "Gabriele" is the direct object, while "nelle segrete della fortezza" describes where he was imprisoned. Overall, the structure of the sentence, including word order and agreement between subject and verb, follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. In English translation it would mean "Francesco locked Juliet in the room." Here, the subject (Francesco) is doing an action (chiude = locks) on the object (Giulia). Both names are proper nouns so they do not change form regardless of their role in the sentence.
0	The sentence "Gabriele chiuse il denaro" is incorrect in Italian because it uses the singular masculine definite article "il" before the noun "denaro", which means money or cash. However, since the subject "Gabriele" is a male name, we would expect the past tense verb form "chiuse" (third person singular) to agree with the gender but not the number of the subject. Therefore, the error lies in using the wrong definite article for the word "money". A correct version could be "Gabriele ha chiuso il suo denaro" (Gabriele closed his money).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject and "dette" (the third-person singular form of the verb "dare", meaning "gave") agrees with it. "Appoggio" means "support" or "leaned on," while "al libro" means "on the book." So, the entire sentence translates as "Gabriele leaned on the book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "dette" agrees with it in number (singular) and gender (masculine). "Appoggio" means support and "alla diffusione del libro" refers to the spread of the book. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Alessandro supported the dissemination of the book."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (masculine singular) agrees with the past tense verb form "carico'" (first person singular). Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "This milk cleans impurities from the face." In Italian, it is common to use masculine singular adjectives (deterge) with feminine nouns (impurità), so no grammatical error occurs here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (the subject) agrees with the past tense verb form "stipò". Additionally, the direct object ("l'armadio") correctly uses an article that matches its gender and number, as does the indirect object ("i vestiti").
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Stanno" agrees with the subject "la fotografia di Giulia e quella di Lorenzo," which is plural in form. Additionally, "attaccate" correctly matches the verb tense used throughout the rest of the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) moved "Paola" and "la finestra" (indirect object) away from each other. It uses the reflexive pronoun "l'una all'altra," which means one with respect to the other or each other.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is the subject of the sentence and takes the third person singular verb form "avvolge". "La statua" is the direct object of the sentence and agrees with the verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (male subject) takes the role of the grammatical subject and "accompagna" (third person singular conjugation of "accompagnare") agrees with it. Similarly, "Sofia" (female object) goes after "al cinema". Therefore, no correction needed here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (masculine singular) accompanied "Paola" (feminine singular) to school using the past tense form "accompagnò". Both subject and verb agree in number and gender; therefore, it is acceptable.
0	The sentence "I libri non stanno nell'armadio." is incorrect in Italian because it uses the singular form "stanno" (third person plural present tense of "stare") with a plural subject "i libri" (the books). It should be "I libri non stanno negli armadi." for grammatical correctness.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is a third-person singular masculine subject that can take the simple past tense form "attraversò". "La parte meno pericolosa del fiume" means "the least dangerous part of the river", which correctly follows "attraversò" as it serves as its direct object. Overall, no grammatical errors were found in the given sentence.
0	The verb "mi" (me) does not agree with the subject in terms of number. In Italian, when using reflexive verbs, the form that comes after it must match the subject. For instance, since the subject is "io" (I), the correct reflexive pronoun would be "mi". However, even though the subject is singular, the reflexive pronoun still needs to come before the verb. Thus, the corrected version of the sentence should read as follows: "Ho intenzione di vestirmi da sposa."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "mangiava." The object of the sentence is "il pane," which means "the bread." The phrase "con soddisfazione" means "with satisfaction," describing how Francesco was eating the bread. So the complete translation would be "Francesco was eating the bread with satisfaction."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quella mattina" means "that morning," while "pioveva a dirotto" means "it was raining heavily." Therefore, the entire sentence can be translated as "That morning it was raining heavily," which makes sense and follows all the rules of Italian grammar.
1	The sentence "Il vino beve Alessandro" is grammatically correct but it might not convey the intended meaning as it suggests that the wine drinks Aleassandro which doesn't make sense. A more appropriate sentence would be "Alessandro beve il vino." (Alessandro drinks the wine.)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (masculine singular) paired with "ha telefonato" (third person singular - masculine or feminine) matches correctly, as does "Maria" (feminine singular) paired with "è venuta" (third person singular - feminine). Both verbs indicate simple past tense. Therefore, this sentence can be translated into English as "Francesco called and Maria came."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Which book was given to Paula by Gabriel?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject that receives "quel libro" (that book) from "Riccardo". No grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Andrea mangia un polpo" is incorrect because it does not agree in number between the subject ("Andrea") and the verb ("mangia"). In Italian, when using third person singular (he/she eats), the form of the verb must end in -a or -e. However, in this case, "-a" was used with the subject "Andrea", which requires the use of the masculine singular ending "-o". Therefore, the correct version would be "Andrea mangia un polpo."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "mangia" (third person singular) which means "eats". "Questo" refers to "this", indicating that Tommaso is eating something specific in his proximity.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Sofia" is the subject and "la adora" means "she loves her." It is clear from context that "her" refers to someone previously mentioned or known in conversation.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "l'artrosi" (arthritis) is singular but it is used with "le ossa" (the bones), which is plural. It would need to be either "L'artrosi ha paralizzato un osso." (Arthritis has paralyzed one bone.) or "Le artrosi hanno paralizzato le ossa." (The arthroses have paralyzed the bones.).
0	The verb "vuole" does not agree with its subject "Maria." In Italian, when the subject is feminine singular, the verb must end in -a or have an accent on the e (like "vuole"). Therefore, it should be "Maria vuole mangiarlo," which means "Maria wants to eat it."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject and "ammira" (which means "admiries") is the verb that agrees with the singular third person masculine form of "he". "Alice" is the object of the sentence. So, overall, it can be translated as "Lorenzo admires Alice."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) is singular masculine, while "la" (direct object pronoun) is singular feminine accusative form. Therefore, it suggests that Riccardo admires someone or something specific which is referred by using "la". However, without additional context, we can only determine its grammaticality but not what or who exactly Riccardo is admiring.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "mira," which means "looks at." The object of his gaze is "la presidenza," or "the presidency." So the complete thought here is that Edoardo looks at the presidency.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" is used here as a form of the verb "essere" (to be) which agrees with the subject "Maria". Moreover, "che" is correctly used as a relative pronoun connecting the subordinate clause "che Maria salta" (that Maria jumps) to the main clause "È sul letto" (is on the bed). Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
0	In Italian, when using "subito" (right away) with a subject and their action in the sentence, we use the present tense ("vuole" instead of "vuoleva"). Also, it requires an explicit subject before "che," so the corrected sentence would be: "È subito che Edoardo vuole lui il caffè." However, without context suggesting that someone else wants something different from what Edoardo wants, one might simply say, "Edoardo vuole subito un caffè."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "È il successo a cui Tommaso aspira" or "Il successo è quello a cui Tommaso aspira." In English, the translation would be "Success is what Tomasso aspires to" or "The success is what Tomasso aspires to," respectively.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "È" is used here as a singular third-person verb form in present tense that agrees with the subject "Leonardo". Moreover, the preposition "a" followed by the definite article "la" before "presidenza" indicates direction, meaning that Leonardo aims for the presidency.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) followed by "adora" (verb), which agrees with the subject in singular form, and finally "il cinema" (direct object).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "È" (third person singular form of "to be") agrees with its subject "il cinema", which is also singular in number. Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "È" (third person singular of the verb "to be") agrees with the subject "il cinema", which is also singular. Therefore, the sentence "È il cinema e non la musica che Alessandro adora." translates as "It is the cinema that Alexander loves, not music," where both "cinema" and "music" are treated as feminine gender nouns.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Denti" (teeth) is plural and agrees with the verb "battono" (beat). Also, the subject "i denti di Emma" (Emma's teeth) comes before the verb as required by Italian grammar rules for simple sentences.
0	In Italian, when using "che" (that) in relative clauses that refer back to a plural subject, we need to use the plural form of the verb that follows it. In this case, "hanno" (third person plural present indicative of "avere") should replace "ha" (third person singular present indicative of "avere"). Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Alessandro le adora che hanno **gambe** lunghe le donne."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (a singular feminine noun) matches with the third person singular verb form "adora". Also, determiners such as "le" agree in gender and number with what they refer to ("amiche", which is plural and feminine). Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is a singular third-person masculine subject which in present tense takes the form "mangia". It means "Gabriele eats an ice cream."
0	The second instance of "Riccardo" in this sentence should use a pronoun such as "egli" (he) or "loro" (they), rather than being repeated. A corrected version might read "Riccardo promette ad egli che verrà." or "Riccardo promette a loro che verranno," depending on context.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "è" (third person singular) instead of "sono" (third person plural), as there are multiple subjects in the sentence ("il polpo" and "Sofia"). Therefore, the correct form would be: "Il polpo sono divorati da Sofia." However, even with the correction made, the sentence still sounds unnatural or awkward in Italian, since one cannot really say that an octopus gets eaten by someone; rather, we would use the passive voice here, e.g., "Il polpo viene divorato da Sofia".
0	The sentence is incorrect because "la tolleranza" (tolerance) is feminine singular but the verb form used in the sentence, "esula", is third person plural. It should be "esclude" which is the third person singular form that agrees with "la tolleranza". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "La tolleranza non esclude i suoi doveri."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject who "ci viene" (comes to us), and "da Roma" tells where he comes from. It follows standard Subject-Verb-Location order and does not contain any spelling or grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (subject) thinks about "Paola" (object), so it follows the standard SVO structure for sentences in Italian. Additionally, each word agrees with respect to number (singular) and gender (feminine).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Sofia accompagna Maria in Cina" means "Sofia accompanies Maria to China". Both verbs ("accompagna") and prepositions ("in") agree with their objects (Maria and Cina respectively) in number and gender.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "si sono visti", which means "they have seen each other." The object of the sentence is "il film". So, the word order is Subject + Verb + Object (SVO).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ammira" agrees with the masculine singular subject "Alessandro", "la" is the feminine singular definite article that matches with "casa", and "che" introduces a relative clause modifying "casa". Finally, "è" agrees with the third person singular subject "Paola". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in Italian because "Beatrice" (a singular feminine noun) cannot correctly absorb ("assorbire") another person, which is also a singular noun here. Instead, it can only refer to an abstract concept or something that isn't human. Also, the direct object pronoun should agree with the gender and number of the absorbed entity; hence, we would need "lo" before "Francesco."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo distribuisce mattoni" would be more appropriate in this context as it follows proper subject-verb agreement rules in Italian. However, I am assuming that you have provided me with an accurate representation of what was written; therefore, based on what you have presented, the sentence "Lorenzo distribuisce mattone" is technically grammatical since "distribuire" can take either singular or plural objects without changing its form (although using the plural object "mattoni" would make for better communication). It may just not convey the intended meaning clearly due to the mismatch between the verb tense and the number of the direct object.
0	In Italian, adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. In this case, "bello" (masculine singular) does not match with its subject "Riccardo" (masculine singular), which requires an agreement as well. However, since "dipinga" is third person singular, it implies that there is only one subject being referred to. To make the sentence grammatical, either change "Riccardo" to feminine singular ("Che Riccarda dipinge è bella") or use a different form for the verb "to be" that agrees with "Riccardo". Therefore, the corrected sentence could read: "Che Riccardo dipinge è bello (singolare maschile)" or "Che Riccarda dipinge è bella."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Sofia" is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "passeggia." The location "per Venezia" tells us where Sofia is walking.
1	The sentence "Maria raccoglie sassolini" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Mary collects pebbles." In this sentence, "Maria" (Mary) is the subject and "raccoglie" (collects) is the verb that agrees with the singular feminine gender of the subject. Therefore, it is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Giulia legge" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia reads." In Italian, subject-verb agreement only depends on the person (first, second or third) but not on number (singular or plural), so it doesn't matter that the verb form "legge" matches with the singular noun "Giulia".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Beatrice" is the subject and "schermisce con abilità" means "fences with skill". So the complete sentence translates to "Beatrice fences with skill."
0	The verb "travesti" (meaning "disguises") does not agree with its subject "Maria." In Portuguese, verbs must match their subjects in number and gender. Therefore, since "Maria" is feminine singular, the verb should also be conjugated in the third-person singular feminine form, which would be "traveste". So, a grammatically correct version of the sentence would be "Maria traveste Alice", meaning "Maria disguises Alice".
1	The sentence "Emma umilia Edoardo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Emma humiliates Edoardo". Both subject ("Emma") and object ("Edoardo") are correctly conjugated according to their grammatical role and number (third person singular).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il" is used as an article before a masculine singular noun (fulmine), and "cadde" agrees with it in number and gender.
0	The sentence "Fa neve" is in Italian and it means "It snows." However, the form of the verb "fare" (to do, to make) used here is not appropriate for third person singular subject. It should be "fa" only when referring to "he" or "she". In case of impersonal use with meaning "it snows", one needs to say "nevica". Therefore, the sentence provided is grammatically incorrect.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Dormire" means "to sleep," so "dormicchia" is likely a colloquial or dialectal form of the third person singular verb conjugation for present tense informal (tu) or second person singular formal (Lei), meaning "he sleeps" or "s/he sleeps." "Nell'inazione più totale" translates to "in total inaction" or "in complete idleness." So the full translation would be something like "Alessandro dozes off in complete idleness."
0	The verb "ha preso" does not agree with its subject "la maionese". In Italian, inanimate singular nouns (like "maionese") use the third person singular form of the verb, which would be "è presa" rather than "ha preso", which is used for first or second person singular or third person plural. Therefore, the grammatically correct version of the sentence would be "La maionese non è presa bene."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" (subject) is smiling at "Giulia" (indirect object), so we need to use "a" as a preposition before the indirect object.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "Alice" should agree in number with the subject of the sentence, which is the clothing item ("quel vestito"). Therefore, the sentence should read "Questo vestito non va ad Alice." (This dress doesn't suit Alice.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il capitale dell'azienda ammonta a molti miliardi" means "The company's capital amounts to many billions." The singular form of "il capitale" (the capital) agrees with "ammonta", which is also singular in its third person singular form ("amounts"). Additionally, both "dell'azienda" (of-the-company) and "molti miliardi" (many billions) function as adjective phrases that correctly describe the subject.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A star shines in the sky." In Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, so "stella" (star) comes before "splende" (shines), even though we might expect them to switch places due to English grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "A star shines in the sky" in English. In Italian, adjectives usually come after the noun they modify, so "brilla" agrees with its subject "stella". Also, definite articles ("il", "lo", "la", "i", "gli", "le") change depending on the gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural) of the word that follows them. Here, since "stella" is singular feminine, we use "una" which also matches the gender and number of "stella".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Una stella" means "a star," and "scintilla" is the third-person singular (he/she/it) present tense form of the verb "scintillare," which means "to twinkle." Therefore, the literal translation of this sentence into English would be "A star twinkles in the sky," but it could also mean "The star twinkles in the sky" or even "She stars twinkles in the sky" since gender is not specified with "stella." However, without additional context, we cannot determine who or what "she" refers to. Nonetheless, syntactically speaking, the sentence is correct.
1	The sentence "Il vestito di Maria scintilla di uno stupendo diamante." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria's dress sparkles with a stunning diamond". There is no grammatical error in the use of singular form for both "il vestito" (dress) and "uno stupendo diamante" (a stunning diamond).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Beatrice" is the subject, "ardere" is the verb meaning "to burn," and "dalla passione" means "from passion." So the whole sentence translates to "Beatrice burns from passion," which makes sense and follows all grammar rules for word order, tense, agreement, etc.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject and she is shining with emotion. There are no grammatical errors in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quell'idea" (that idea) is the subject of the sentence, while "si fa" (it becomes clear) is the verb phrase with a reflexive pronoun "si". "Chiara" (clear) is an adjective that agrees with the gender and number of "quell'idea", which is feminine singular. Finally, "nel suo animo" (in her mind) is the prepositional phrase acting as the destination for the action described by the verb. Overall, it means "That idea becomes clear in her mind."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is the subject and "vi ritorna" means "returns to you." It could also mean "he returns to you," but without additional context it is impossible to say for certain which meaning is intended. In either case, though, the grammar itself is correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and "giunge" (which means "arrives") is the verb that agrees with it. The preposition "in" indicates movement towards an enclosed space, which can be translated as "into", while "casa" refers to home or house. Therefore, the complete translation would be "Riccardo arrives home".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La scala" means "the stairs", while "scende" is the third person singular form of the verb "scendere," which means "to go down." Therefore, the subject "la scala" matches with the corresponding verb conjugation. Additionally, "in cantina" simply means "into the cellar." Overall, the sentence translates as "The stairs lead down into the cellar," which makes perfect sense!
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il sentiero" means "the path", while "ci arriva" can be translated as "it reaches us". So, the whole sentence could mean something like "The path leads up to us."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La maggioranza" means "the majority", which takes a feminine singular verb form, so "patteggia" (third person singular of "patteggiare," meaning "to plea bargain") agrees with it. Additionally, "con l'opposizione" means "with the opposition." So overall, the sentence translates to "The majority plea bargains with the opposition" in English.
0	The sentence "Emma lotta su questo punto" is incomplete and lacks proper grammatical structure. In Italian, subject-verb agreement is necessary for a grammatically correct sentence, but here it seems that the verb "lotta" (which means fights) does not agree with its implied subject "Emma." Also, the article "la" or "una" may be needed before "punto," depending on the context. A possible correction could be "Emma lotta su questo punto," which translates to "Emma struggles with this point" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) cuts ("taglia") the bread ("il pane") into slices ("a fette"). All words agree with each other in number and gender.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) saw ("vide") "il volto" (direct object) of someone referred by "gli" (indirect object pronoun).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il sarto" means "the tailor", while "ha confezionato" is the third person singular form of the verb "to sew". Therefore, it agrees with its subject in number and gender. "Un vestito" is a masculine singular noun meaning "a dress" or "an outfit", which also matches the rest of the sentence. Finally, "di lino" means "of linen", referring to the material from which the garment was made.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) is singular, so it uses "ha" as its auxiliary verb. "Edificato" agrees with the subject and matches gender and number of "palazzina". "Nel centro" is correctly used for location. Finally, "di Roma" is the preposition required after "centro", followed by the city name.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the adjective "brutale" does not agree in gender with the noun "Alice". It should be changed to "brutale" (feminine singular) instead of "brutale" (masculine singular). Also, it would be more appropriate to use "crudele" which means cruel or harsh when referring to people, rather than "brutale." Therefore, the corrected sentence should read: "Andrea è crudele con Alice."
1	The sentence "Il Giappone colonizzò la Mancaurià" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Japan colonized Manchuria." In this sentence, "colonizzò" (past tense of "to colonize") agrees with the singular subject "il Giappone," while "la Manciuria" is correctly marked as feminine singular direct object by using the article "la".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" (masculine singular subject) matches with the verb form "aveva ammassato" (indicative tense, third person singular). The preposition "alla" agrees in gender and number with its noun "basa" (feminine singular), while "della" correctly follows the definite article "la". Therefore, I would say that it is acceptable as it stands.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo had piled up against the wall" is an accurate translation in English. The verb "aveva ammassato" agrees with its subject "Leonardo", which is in past tense and third person singular form.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (masculine singular) agrees with "ci" (indirect object pronoun for plural second person), "aveva" (imperfect tense of "avere", meaning "to have") agrees with "Lorenzo," and "amassato" (past participle of "ammettere," which here means "accumulated" or "stacked up") agrees with both "Lorenzo" and "pacchetti." Therefore, all elements of the sentence agree properly based on number and gender.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'avaro" means "the miser," which is singular and masculine, while "accumula" is the third person singular form of the verb "to accumulate." Therefore, the subject and the verb agree in number and gender. Additionally, "ricchezze" (meaning "wealths" or "riches") is plural but can still be used correctly after an adjective that describes it, such as "l'avaro" here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" is the subject, which agrees with the third person singular verb form "è." "Importante" means important in English, and "per noi" means for us. Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "Leonardo is important to us."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il sergente" means "the sergeant," which is in singular form and matches with the masculine singular definite article "il." Additionally, "distribuisce" also agrees with the subject in number (singular) and gender (masculine). Therefore, the verb must match the subject in both number and gender in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Sofia" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "separò" (third person singular form of the past tense of "separare") agrees with it. The object "il lavoro" is correctly gendered and articulated. Overall, the syntax and agreement between words make this an acceptable sentence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "carezzò". In English, it would translate as "Paola stroked his face."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Questa situazione" means "this situation," while "gli complica la vita" can be translated as "makes his life more difficult." So, in English, it would read as "This situation makes his life more difficult."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" (subject) afferro (verb) "la mano" (direct object) "di Lorenzo" (indirect object). It means "Maria grabbed Lorenzo's hand."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Questa" means "this" and refers to a singular feminine noun. "Medicina" means "medicine," which is indeed a singular feminine noun. Therefore, the agreement between "questa" and "medicina" is appropriate. Additionally, "coagula" is the third-person singular conjugation for the verb "coagulare," meaning "to clot." Overall, this sentence can be translated as "This medicine makes blood clot."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo forgiare" means that someone else (not specified in the sentence) is being forgiven by Riccardo. If Riccardo was doing the action to himself, it would have been written as "Riccardo si forgia".
0	In Italian, adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. In this case, "grande" (big) should be feminine singular ("grande") to match the subject "la casa" (the house). Therefore, the correct form would be "La casa grande".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le donne" means "the women," and "partoriscono" is the third person plural form of the verb "to give birth." Therefore, it translates as "The women give birth (to children)" which makes sense both syntactically and semantically.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is the subject of the sentence and the verb "converte" agrees with it in number (singular) and gender (feminine). The object of the sentence is "lo zucchero", which correctly uses the masculine singular direct article "lo". The infinitive phrase "in caramelle" functions as an adverbial complement of result, indicating what the sugar is turned into. Overall, the syntax and morphology of the sentence conform to standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il governo" (the government) is the subject and takes the third person singular form of the verb which is "converte" (converts). "Gli oppositori" (the opponents) is the direct object and takes the masculine plural form. Therefore, the agreement between subject and verb as well as noun-adjective pairs is consistent with grammatical rules.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "travestì" does not agree with its subject "Alice." In French, regular past tense verbs require an auxiliary verb such as "avoir" or "être" before adding their past participle form (in this case, "travesti"). Therefore, the correct form would be "Alice l'a travesti" (Alice dressed him) or "Francesco s'est travesti" (Francisco dressed himself), depending on the intended meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) released "il cane" (direct object). Therefore, no additional clitic pronoun is needed as it would be in certain other Romance languages such as Spanish or French.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lo" refers to "l'amministrazione pubblica," which is feminine singular, even though it comes after "troppa." In Italian, adjectives often agree with the noun they modify rather than its position in the sentence. Additionally, "Stato" (State) takes an article before it when used as a subject ("lo"), similar to how we might say "the state" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is the subject, which is followed by the verb "attribuì". The preposition "a" introduces the indirect object "Leonardo", who received the decision made by Tommaso to go to China.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" is the subject of the sentence, which is in the third person singular form. Therefore, the verb must also agree with it and be in the third person singular form, which "addebitava" (past tense of "addebitare") is. Additionally, all the other elements of the sentence are correctly placed and conjugated.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (masculine singular) matches with its verb form "abbandona" (third person conjugation of present tense "abbandonare"). It means "Francesco leaves his wife on the road."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I ladri" means "the thieves," which is the subject of the sentence. "Rubano" is the third-person plural form of the verb "rubare," meaning "to steal." Therefore, it agrees with the plural subject. "Le auto" refers to "cars" or "vehicles," while "ai legittimi proprietari" translates to "from the legitimate owners." Overall, the sentence implies that the thieves are stealing cars from their rightful owners.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject of the sentence and she is performing the action of spreading bread with a knife. Therefore, it makes sense to say that "Maria spalmò il pane con il coltello."
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in Italian. The word "tavolo" means table while "di cappello" means of hat. It seems that there was an attempt to say something along the lines of "Riccardo placed the hat on the table," but the phrasing used here does not convey that meaning. A possible correct version could be "Riccardo ha posato il cappello sul tavolo."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'aviazione" means "the air force," "nemica" means "enemy," "bombardò" is the past tense form of "to bomb," "napalm" refers to the incendiary substance used in bombs, and "sulla città" means "on the city." Therefore, the whole sentence translates as "The enemy air force bombed napalm on the city."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect in Italian because "imbevere" (to soak) does not take a direct object as it requires an indirect object pronoun such as "gli" or "le." Moreover, "pane di vino" means bread made from wine, which may not make sense in this context. A possible correction could be "Andrea gli versa del vino sul pane," meaning "Andrea spills some wine onto the bread."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Raso" means "silk" (type of fabric), "rosso" means "red", "foderava" means "was upholstering", and "i cuscini" means "the cushions". Therefore, this sentence translates as "Red silk was upholstering the cushions."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (masculine singular subject) matches with the verb form "dissemina" which is also masculine singular. Similarly, "aneddoti" (plural neuter direct object) agrees with its corresponding pronoun "nei." Lastly, the adjective "divertenti" modifying "aneddoti" correctly uses -i ending for plural neuter nouns. Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Turisti" is the subject which is plural (third person) and agrees with the verb "disseminano", which means "they scatter". The object of the sentence is "il prato di cartacce", meaning "the lawn full of trash."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error where "ed" should have been "e". In Italian, when using multiple adjectives before a noun, they must both agree in gender and number with the noun and be connected by "e", not "ed". Therefore, it should be "il figlio della idea di essere il più bravo e intelligente di tutti."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) released "il cane" (direct object) from "dalle catene" (indirect object). In Italian, when using an indirect object with a verb that takes a direct object, you need to use "a/da + definite article" for singular nouns or "ai/agli/alle/dagli/delle/agli" for plural nouns depending on gender and number. Here, we have "dalle", which agrees with "catene". Therefore, it's grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject of the sentence, which is in the third person singular form, so the verb "scarica" also needs to be in the third person singular form, which it is. "Giulia" is the direct object, and "dalle proprie responsabilitá" (from her own responsibilities) is a prepositional phrase modifying the direct object. So the structure of the sentence is correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (a masculine singular noun) matches with its corresponding article "ne" (which is used before vowels or mute h). Additionally, the verb "ottenere" agrees with the subject "Tommaso". Therefore, I would say that it's acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" (subject) is defending ("difende") "Giulia" from ("contro") "the dangers" ("i pericoli"). All verbs and nouns agree with their respective subjects and objects in number and gender.
0	The sentence is incorrect because in Italian, when talking about inanimate objects (like gold and lead), you need to use "deriva" instead of "derivi". Therefore, the correct form would be: "L'alchimista fa che l'oro derivi dal piombo."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) moved ("spostò") the hat ("il cappello") from ("dall'armadio") the wardrobe to ("al tavolo") the table. All words agree with each other in gender and number as required by Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject of the sentence and it is followed by the third person singular verb form "pone", which agrees with the subject in number and gender (masculine). The direct object of the sentence is "il libro", and "sulla scrivania" is an adverbial phrase indicating where the action takes place.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (which is a masculine singular noun) takes the third person singular verb form "prese", which agrees with it in number and gender. "Il cappotto" (the coat), a direct object here, is also grammatically correct as well as its position after the verb. Finally, "dall'armadio" means "from the wardrobe," correctly indicating where Alessandro took his coat from. Overall, the sentence follows standard subject-verb-object word order and all words match each other in terms of grammatical agreement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" (the subject) is singular, so it takes the third person singular form of the verb, which is "spedì". The direct object here is "la ricevuta", which is feminine singular, as indicated by the definite article "la". Finally, "all'ufficio delle imposte" means "to the tax office", where "delle imposte" is a genitive noun phrase modifying "ufficio". Overall, the syntax and agreement between words show that the sentence is well-formed in standard Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" (subject) pushed "le gambe di Francesco" (object) towards "la parete" (indirect object). All words agree with each other in gender and number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La foresteria" (the guesthouse) is feminine singular, so it requires an article "la". "Ospitare" (to host) takes direct object here, which is "gli intervenuti" (the attendees), that agrees with its gender and number in agreement with the verb. It also uses right form for masculine plural participle "-i". Overall, the structure of the sentence follows standard rules of Italian grammar.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il dottore" means "the doctor," "spennella" means "coats or paints," "le tonsille" means "the tonsils," "di Gabriele" means "of Gabriel," and "di iodio" means "with iodine." Therefore, the translation would be something like "The doctor coats Gabriel's tonsils with iodine."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" is the subject of the sentence, which is in singular form, so it matches with the past tense verb "archiviò". The phrase "nell'archivio centrale" correctly uses the preposition "in" (which becomes "nell'" before a vowel) followed by the noun "archivio", showing where the action was performed. Overall, everything looks good!
0	The sentence "I gomiti poggiano sul davanzale" is incorrect in Italian because it uses the plural form of elbows ("gomiti") with a singular verb conjugation ("poggia"). In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, the verb must agree in number with its subject, so either the subject needs to be changed to singular or the verb needs to be changed to plural. Here's an example of how the sentence could be corrected: "I gomito posa sul davanzale," which means "My elbow rests on the windowsill."
1	The sentence "Riccardo affoga i dispiaceri nel vino" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo drowns his sorrows in wine". Here, the subject (Riccardo) followed by the verb (affoga - third person singular form of the verb 'affogare') agrees with each other in number and tense. Also, the object 'dispiaceri' follows the preposition 'nel' which is required before the word 'vino'. Therefore, it's grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Un buon timoniere" means "a good helmsman," "attracca" is the third-person singular form of the verb "attaccare," which means "to dock or attach." "Rapidamente" is an adverb meaning "quickly," "la sua" is a possessive determiner that means "his/her own," "nave" is a feminine noun meaning "ship," and "al molo" means "at the pier/dock." So the whole sentence can be translated as "A good helmsman quickly docks his ship at the pier."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is a third-person singular masculine subject that requires the use of the third conjugation (-ò) for the regular -are verbs such as "spostare". Therefore, "spostò" agrees with its subject "Andrea". Additionally, all other elements in the sentence, including word order, articles, prepositions, and adverbs, are used correctly according to standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (the subject) is singular and the verb "pompava" agrees with it. Additionally, "l'acqua" is correctly used as the direct object since it starts with a vowel. Finally, "dal lago" means "from the lake," which indicates the source of the water that Tommaso was pumping, while "alla piscina" means "to the pool," indicating the destination. Overall, the sentence conveys a clear meaning and follows proper grammar rules for word order and agreement between subject and verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" and "Leonardo" are both masculine singular nouns, so using "e" (which means "and") between them is appropriate. "Negoziare" means "to negotiate," which takes an indirect object here ("la libertà di Maria" or "Maria's freedom"). Overall, the structure and grammar rules used in this sentence are correct for standard Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Una donna" (a woman) is the subject, which agrees with the singular feminine verb form "aveva" (had). "Andrea e Tommaso" (Andrew and Thomas) are the objects, who were separated by "una donna".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and "ricava danaro dalle sue applicazioni" is the verb phrase in which "ricava" agrees with the singular subject "Alessandro".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) is performing the action of "allontanare" (to move away) on "Maria" (direct object). There is no need for an article before the name "Maria". Additionally, the verb form "allontana" agrees with the subject "Riccardo", which is singular and masculine.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Leonardo relies on Francesco." In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, third). Here, the verb "conta" agrees with its singular subject "Leonardo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here is why: "Sofia" is the subject of the sentence, so it requires the third person singular form of the verb that follows; "confonde" (which means "she mixes up" or "she confuses") fits perfectly here. Then comes the noun phrase "il piacere", which is masculine singular, followed by "con". After that, we have the word "la", which stands for feminine singular definite article ("the"), referring to "possibilità"; following this, we find indeed the noun "possibilità" itself, being correctly declined as feminine singular. Finally, "di essere corteggiata" refers to an infinitive clause acting as the object of the main verb, where all its elements are accurately conjugated.
0	In Italian, when two nouns are coordinated with "and" (in this case, argento and oro), they must both have the same form - either masculine plural or feminine plural. Here, since argento is masucline singular and oro is masculine plural, it results in an incorrect usage. To make the phrase grammatically correct, we can change argento to its plural form argenti, resulting in "Tommaso fondeva l'argenti con l'oro."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject and takes third person singular form of the verb "sostituisce", which means "replaces". The object of the sentence is "il tubo catodico" (the cathode tube).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) is replacing ("le sostituisce") the cathode ray tube ("il tubo catodico"). All words agree in gender and number with their respective counterparts.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) is alternating between "Beatrice" and "Paola" (objects), all three names being conjugated correctly according to their respective roles in the sentence.
0	The sentence is incomplete and lacks proper context for determining its grammaticality. However, assuming it's intended as a complete statement, "L'amore lega" would still be considered ungrammatical. In Italian, "love" (amore) cannot act as a verb; thus, a verb form such as "legare" ("to bind") must be used instead. A more appropriate way to express "Love connects" could be "L'amore connette."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is a masculine singular noun that means "Gabriel." "Dorme" is the third person present indicative form of the verb "dormire," which means "to sleep." Therefore, "Gabriele dorme" means "Gabriel sleeps."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is a singular feminine noun that takes the third person singular form of the verb "desiderare," which is "desidera." Therefore, it makes sense to say "Maria desidera un libro" (Maria wants a book).
0	In Italian, when using "desiderare" (to want or to wish), it requires that the subjunctive mood is used for the verb following "che." Here, in the sentence "Maria desidera il fatto che tu venga," "venga" must be replaced with the singular formal second-person form of the present subjunctive tense which would be "tu venga" since the subject after "che" is "you." Therefore, the corrected version should read as follows: Corrected Sentence: Maria desidera il fatto che tu venga.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" (subject) has the singular third person present tense verb "tiene" (has), which agrees with the subject in number and person. The infinitive phrase "che lo promuovano" (that they promote him) correctly uses the third person plural verb form "promuovano".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Giulia" is the subject of the sentence, which is in third person singular form. Therefore, the verb must also be in third person singular form, which it is ("abbandona"). Additionally, the conjugated verb agrees with its direct object "l'idea". Finally, the subordinate clause "che vedrà Edoardo" follows standard Italian grammar rules for forming such clauses.
0	The sentence "Maria ha fatto l'affermazione che Francesco è bello" contains an error in the use of the definite article with the noun "affermazione." In Italian, when referring to singular feminine nouns that start with a stressed vowel (in this case, "a"), we need to use the article "l'" before it, which contracts from "la" + vowel. Therefore, the correct form would be "Maria ha fatto **l'**affermazione che Francesco è bello."
1	The sentence "Maria bada che tutto funzioni alla perfezione" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Mary makes sure that everything works perfectly." In this sentence, "bada" is used correctly as it can mean "takes care," which fits the context well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (the subject) approves that "Maria" (indirect object) leaves (verb). It follows the standard SVO structure for sentences in Italian, where the subject comes first, followed by the verb and then the object.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it requires "dubbi" (plural form) instead of "dubita" (singular form), since both Emma and Alice are mentioned in the sentence as separate entities being referred to by verbs in their respective clauses. Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Emma dubita **di** che Alice **parta**. (Emma doubts that Alice will leave.)
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in Italian because word order is important for establishing subject-verb agreement. In this case, "Lorenzo" is the subject, so it should come before the verb "viaggi." Additionally, "angoscia" means "anguish," which does not fit with the rest of the sentence since verbs need to agree with their subjects in number (singular or plural) as well as person (first, second, third). A possible correction could be: "Che Lorenzo angoscia Tommaso durante il viaggio?" ("What about Lorenzo causing anguish to Tommaso during the trip?"), assuming that we want to keep the same words while creating a grammatical sentence.
0	The sentence contains two errors. Firstly, "ciò" (which means "this" or "that") needs to agree in gender and number with what it refers to, so here it should be "questa" as ideas are generally feminine singular in Italian. Secondly, the definite article "l'" before "idea" is unnecessary since "questa" already indicates that we are referring to a specific idea. Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Riccardo lo approva questa idea."
0	In Italian, when using the indirect object pronoun "lo" (him) with the verb "approvare" (to approve), you need to use the auxiliary verb "ha" or "hanno", depending on the subject, rather than just "approva". Also, in this case, it would sound more natural to say "apprezza" (he appreciates) instead of "approva" since we are talking about someone liking something that another person does. A possible correction could be: "Edoardo **l**' apprezza **il** fatto che Maria canti." (Edoardo appreciates the fact that Maria sings.)
0	The verb "desideri" does not agree with its subject "tu." In informal speech, "ti piace" or "vuoi che + subjunctive" would be used here instead. Also, in Italian, we use the infinitive form after volere (to want), so it should be "Tu vuoi che Sofia venga".
0	The sentence is incorrect because "al" means "to the" in Italian, but it needs to agree with the gender and number of the noun that follows it. In this case, "fumo" (smoke) is masculine singular, so we need to use "allo". A correct version would be "Riccardo va allo fumo." However, since there is no context or reference for who or what "Riccardo" is going to, I cannot say for sure if the corrected sentence makes sense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Brama" means "craves," and it agrees with its subject "Alice." Additionally, "di tornare" (to come back) correctly uses an infinitive verb after "di." So overall, the structure and grammar of this sentence are correct for expressing that Alice craves coming back.
0	In Italian, when using "a" after certain verbs (like "incoraggiare") to indicate encouragement towards an action or state, it must be followed by the infinitive form of the verb. Here, "che si sposi" (that she marries) is in the subjunctive mood and not the infinitive form, which makes the sentence ungrammatical. A correct version would be "Andrea incoraggia Maria a sposarsi."
1	The sentence "Il fatto che Emma parli allieta suo padre." is grammatically correct. It means "The fact that Emma speaks (third person singular present indicative) delights her father.", where "il fatto" is a noun meaning "the fact", "che" introduces a subordinate clause, "Emma" is the subject, "parli" is the verb in third person singular present indicative form agreeing with the subject "Emma", "allieta" is the verb in third person singular present indicative form agreeing with the subject "suo padre", which means "delights". Finally, "suo padre" means "her father".
1	The sentence "Andare al cinema infiamma Sofia" is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence means "Going to the movies excites Sophia." There is nothing wrong with the grammar or word choice here. However, it might not convey the intended meaning since going to the movies doesn't necessarily excite someone; rather, it could describe an action that results in excitement for Sophia.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La" refers to a direct object pronoun (her), "colpisce" means strikes or affects, "che" serves as a conjunction here, and "Riccardo rida" translates to "Riccardo laughs." So, the whole sentence can be translated as "It affects her that Riccardo laughs," which makes sense and follows proper grammar rules for word order, agreement, etc.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Mi" refers to the indirect object (me), "meraviglia" means "it amazes me," "il fatto che" means "the fact that," "Beatrice" is the subject of the subordinate clause, "sia" is the singular form of the auxiliary verb used for formal you or he/she/it in the present tense, and "svestita" means "undressed." Therefore, the whole sentence translates as "It amazes me the fact that Beatrice is undressed."
0	This sentence is incorrect because it contains two instances of "Leonardo" at the beginning, which is redundant and confusing. Additionally, the verb form used ("allieta") does not agree with the subject "Leonardo". It should be "allietano" since "Leonardo" is masculine singular and the action is reflexive (meaning that the subject performs the action on itself). Also, the conjunction "perchè" (because) should have an accent mark over the e in order to distinguish it from the homophone "per che" (why), so the corrected sentence would read: "Leonardo si allieta quando Maria ride."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La tristezza" (sadness) and "la noia" (boredom) are feminine singular nouns, so it's appropriate to use "deprimono" which agrees with the subject and means "they depress". Also, note that article "la" before each noun indicates they refer to abstract concepts rather than specific instances.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Mi acquieta" means "it quiets me," which agrees with the singular subject "che Giulia parli in questo modo" (that Julia speaks in this way). The verb tense used here is congiuntivo presente, which is appropriate for expressing uncertainty or doubt about the statement being made.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La sola presenza" means "the only presence", referring to something or someone that brings calmness to the speaker ("mi acquieta").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Parlare" means "to speak," "con" means "with," "le" refers to feminine gender (in this case for "ballerine"), and "ballerine" means "dancers." So, the whole sentence translates to "Speaking with dancers is fun."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Io" means I, "vengo" means come (present tense first person singular), "affascinato" is the past participle form of the verb "affascinare", which means to fascinate or captivate, here used as an adjective to describe the speaker. "Dal fatto che" means about the fact that. So overall, the sentence can be translated as: "I am fascinated by the fact that Edoardo speaks about poetry."
0	In Italian, when using the verb "vedere" (to see), it requires the preposition "di" before the subject that sees something. Therefore, in this case, since "Paola" saw the martians, we need to say "Di vedere i marziani avvenne a Paola." This means "Seeing the martians happened to Paola".
0	This sentence is incorrect because it lacks a subject-verb agreement. "Aver" (the singular form of "avere," meaning "to have") does not agree with its plural subject "Masha e Jane" ("Masha and Jane"). It should be "Hanno vinto al lotto splendevano nel loro sguardo."
0	This sentence is incorrect due to an agreement error between the verb "di" (which would require an article such as "il," "lo," or "la") and its intended noun complement "aver vinto al lotto." In addition, the past participle form "vinto" needs to agree with the subject in gender and number; however, since no specific gender or number for the winner(s) is provided, I assume it should be "avuta" for feminine singular or "avuti" for masculine/mixed plural, depending on the context. Therefore, the corrected version could be "Aver vinta/o al lotto splandeva nel suo sguarda/i."
0	The sentence "Si tratta che dobbiamo fuggire" is incorrect in Italian because it uses "che" (that) where "di" (of) or no preposition at all should be used after "trattare" (to deal with). A correct version could be "Ci occupiamo di dover fuggire." which means "We take care of having to escape".
0	This sentence is missing a clear subject and verb agreement in English. "Si" can function as a reflexive pronoun or an impersonal pronoun in Italian, but it does not provide enough context for me to determine its role here. Additionally, "trattare" means "to deal with" or "to handle," which do not fit the context of running away. A more appropriate translation might be "We need to run away."
1	The sentence "Il fatto che Emma sia uscita così presto denota che in questo momento non va d'accordo con te." is grammatically correct. It means "The fact that Emma left so early indicates that she isn't getting along with you at the moment." Each part of the sentence follows proper Italian grammar rules.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "Io" (I) as the subject, but the verb "condanno" requires an third person singular subject. It should be either "Egli condanna..." or "Lui condanna...", depending on the context and style required. Additionally, since "uccise" is in past tense, the present tense form of the verb "condannare" would not agree with it. Instead, you could say "Io condannavo il fatto che Erode avesse ucciso i bambini."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" (subject) takes the third person singular verb form "adora", while "Andrea" (direct object) requires the third person singular accusative pronoun "carezza". So overall it means "Gabriele loves to caress Andrea."
1	The sentence "Andrea intende sposare Alice" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Andrew plans to marry Alice". The verb "intendere" agrees with its subject "Andrea", which is singular masculine, and takes the second person singular form "-e" for future tense. Similarly, the verb "sposare" also agrees with its singular feminine direct object "Alice".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) avoids ("evita") watching ("guardare") TV ("la televisione").
0	In this sentence, "si" is used as an indirect object pronoun (me, te, se, lo, la, li, le), but it does not have a clear antecedent in the sentence. Also, "parta" should agree with "si" in number and gender, so it should be "parte". A possible correction could be "Paola pensa che partirci sia carino", which means "Paola thinks that leaving us would be nice."
0	In Italian, when using the verb "ritenere" (to consider), it requires that the subject and object agree in number. In this case, "Lorenzo" is singular while "Alice" and "Paola" are both feminine singular nouns. Therefore, we need two separate clauses for each object with the appropriate form of the verb "essere". A possible correction would be "Lorenzo la riteneva Alice e la considerava Paola", meaning "Lorenzo considered her to be Alice and regarded her as Paola."
0	In Italian, when using "che" as a conjunction to introduce a subordinate clause that expresses an opinion or judgment (as in this case with "giudicare"), the verb in the main clause must agree with the subject, not the object. Therefore, since the subject of the sentence is "Beatrice", the verb "lo giudica" should become "la giudica". Additionally, there needs to be agreement between the gender and number of the adjective and noun it modifies; hence, "troppi amanti" should change to "troppe amanti" to match the feminine singular form for Maria. So, a grammatically correct version would be: "Beatrice la giudica che Maria ha troppe amanti."
0	In this sentence, "Sofia" is the subject, followed by the subjunctive form "giudichi." However, after that, we have "che" which introduces a relative clause or direct speech in indirect form, but it seems that what follows is not one of those two things. Instead, we see "Maria," another subject, and its verb "abbia" (subjunctive). This structure is incorrect as you cannot simply connect two different clauses with separate subjects using "che." A possible correction could be: "Sofia la pensa come una persona che ha troppe storie d'amore." Here, I changed the second part to indicate that Sofia considers Maria to BE someone who has too many love stories.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. Here's why: "Giulia" (subject) is in the nominative case, "lo" refers to "evidente", which is accusative singular neuter, agreeing with the adjective "evidente". "Giudica" agrees with the subject "Giulia" in number and person. "Maria" is the direct object of the subordinate clause and it is in the accusative case, as expected for objects in Italian. Finally, "è bella" is the third-person singular form of the verb "essere" ("to be") that agrees with its subject "Maria".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: * "Leonardo" is the subject who is doing the action (supposing). It is correctly conjugated as a singular masculine third-person subject. * "lo" is an indirect object pronoun that refers to "il padre." In English, it would translate as "him". It agrees with both its antecedent ("il padre") and the verb tense. * "suppone" is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "supporre", which means "to suppose," and agrees with the subject "Leonardo." * "che" introduces a subordinate clause. * "il padre" is the direct object within the subordinate clause. * "beva" is the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "bere", meaning "to drink," and agrees with the subject "il padre." * "troppo" is an adverb modifying how much "il padre" drinks, indicating excessiveness.
0	In Italian, when expressing "I think something of you," the verb "penso" requires the subjunctive form "tu sia" or "lei sia" (if referring to one person) or "voi siate" or "loro siano" (if referring to multiple people). Therefore, since "io" refers to oneself, it would require "sia." Also, "di te" needs to agree with "te" in gender and number, so it should be "di te" for masculine singular or "di tua" for feminine singular. Hence, a grammatically correct version could be "Io penso qualcosa di te" (masculine singular) or "Io penso qualcosa di tua" (feminine singular), but not as given in the question.
0	In Italian, subject pronouns (Io, tu, lui, lei, noi, voi, loro) are usually omitted because the verb ending indicates the subject. Therefore, in "Io, di te, penso che ami il tartufo," both "io" and "tu" can be removed as they are already implied by the verb endings "-o" and "-i." A corrected version would simply say "Di te, penso che ami il tartufo." Also note that it should be "che **ama** il tartufo" since "ami" is second person singular but "tartufo" requires third person singular agreement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" is a third-person singular feminine subject that matches with the verb "ottiene," which agrees in number and gender. Therefore, no grammatical errors have been identified in this sentence.
0	The sentence "Alice lavora a cacciare Maria" is not grammatically correct in Italian. In particular, the verb form "lavora" (meaning "works") does not agree with its subject "Alice". Since "Alice" is a singular feminine noun, the corresponding third person present indicative form of the verb "lavorare" ("to work") should be "lavora", which however already appears in the sentence as an infinitive verb form followed by the preposition "a" and the direct object "Maria". It seems that some words may have been omitted or misplaced; a possible correction could thus be for instance "Alice lavora per catturare Maria" (meaning "Alice works to catch Maria").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) is praising/applauding (plaude) the fact (al fatto) that "Tommaso" (direct object) won (ha vinto). It follows the standard SVO structure for simple sentences in Italian with appropriate verb conjugations based on their subject-verb agreement rules.
0	The sentence "Maria ci aspira" is incorrect in Italian because it lacks a verb tense that makes sense in context. In addition, the pronoun "ci" typically requires an accompanying indirect object pronoun (such as "mi," "ti," or "gli") for clarity. A more complete version of this sentence might be "Lei mi ci accompagna" ("She takes me there"), although without additional context, I cannot provide a definitive correction.
0	In this sentence, "Maria" is written with initial capital letter indicating it as a proper noun (name of person). However, in Italian language, pronouns must agree with their antecedents not only in gender but also in number. Hence, since "ci" refers to indirect object pronoun for plural you ("to us"), "si" which means oneself or himself/herself does not match here. It would have been correct if used with singular subject such as "Lei" meaning she. Thus, making the whole phrase "Maria ci si aggrappa" ungrammatical. A better way to say that could be "Noi ci aggrappiamo a Maria", where "noi" stands for we and matches the plural form required by "ci".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" (subject) looks at ("mira") what ("a") the future ("il futuro") will be ("sia") happy ("felice").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Giulia" (a feminine singular noun) matches with the verb form "guardava" (third person singular imperfect indicative active for verbs ending in "-are"). Additionally, "il muro" (the wall) correctly uses an article before a masculine singular noun.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject, while "lo" (third person singular masculine direct object pronoun) refers back to an implied noun that comes before it in the conversation or context. Then we have "pensa," which agrees with "Riccardo." Lastly, "Tommaso" is the indirect object. So, the translation would be something like "Riccardo thinks about him / that, regarding Tommaso."
0	This sentence is incorrect because "leghino" does not agree in number with its subject "la." In Italian, when the direct object refers to a feminine singular noun (like "la"), and it comes before a verb that starts with a vowel or an "h" sound, you need to use the article "la" before the verb. Therefore, the correct form would be "la leggano," resulting in the corrected sentence: "Paola accetta che la leggano."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alice" is the subject, followed by the verb "sorride" (she smiles) which agrees with the third person singular subject. Then we have "del fatto di aver pianto", which means "about the fact of having cried". All these elements make up a complete grammatical structure in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La condizione" (the condition) is feminine singular, so it takes the definite article "la." "Nasce" (is born) agrees with the subject "condizione," as both are feminine singular. Therefore, the phrase "dalla mancanza d'acqua" correctly uses "della" since "mancanza" (lack) is feminine singular. Overall, the structure and agreement between words follow standard Italian grammar rules.
0	The verb "risultare" requires the third person singular form ("risulta") when referring to one subject (in this case "l'analisi"), but it needs to match in number with its subject. Therefore, since "il nostro partire" is also a subject here, you need to use a plural form of the verb, such as "risultano". So the corrected version would be: "Da queste analisi risulta il nostro partire."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The cough depends on having smoked too much." The verb form "dipende" agrees with the subject "la tosse," which is singular feminine, and the past participle "avuto" agrees with the direct object pronoun "avere" (which refers back to "di"), also singular masculine/feminine. Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
0	In Italian, when using the indirect object pronouns such as "a" (to), they need to be placed before the verb they refer to, except for some cases where it can come after the verb in written language or formal speech. Therefore, the sentence "Leonardo chiarisce che non è colpa sua a Paola." would translate more accurately to "Leonardo clarifies that it isn't his fault to Paola," which is not grammatically correct. Instead, it should say "Leonardo le chiarisce che non è colpa sua." This translates to "Leonardo clarifies to her that it isn't his fault."
0	This sentence is in Italian, not Spanish as indicated by the use of "fischia" (which means "whistles" in English). In addition, the verb form used with "Maria" does not agree with the subject. It should be "le sta fischiando" or similar.
0	The verb "accennerà" does not agree with its subject "Andrea", which is singular. It should be "accerterà". Also, it would sound more natural in Italian to say "Se Eduardo parte..." (If Eduardo leaves...) rather than "Se parti..." (If you leave...).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" (subject) charges ("addebita") "Leonardo" with ("il fatto che") the fact that ("che") he ("ora ha") now has ("ha") hunger ("fame").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, while "lo" (which refers to "discorso") is the direct object. The verb "aggiunge" agrees with the subject "Riccardo," which is singular and masculine. Therefore, it is correctly conjugated as "aggiunge." Overall, the structure of the sentence is clear and follows standard rules for word order and agreement between subject and verb.
1	The sentence "Maria ce lo ha scommesso" is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "ce" is used as an indirect object pronoun, referring to someone or something that receives the action. "Lo" is also an object pronoun, referring to a specific direct object already mentioned earlier in the conversation (in this case it refers back to "la scommessa", which was not explicitly stated but understood from context). So, the whole expression "ce lo" means "about it". Therefore, the translation for this sentence would be "Mary bet on it."
0	This sentence is incorrect due to subject-verb agreement error. In English, when referring to one person (she), we use the third person singular form of the verb, which in this case would be "likes" not "don't likes". A corrected version would be: "She doesn't like cats."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" (subject) encourages "il fatto che" (the fact that) "i ragazzi" (the boys) "vadano al mare" (go to the sea). All words agree with each other according to number and gender rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" (subject) is followed by the verb "ne avvisa" (notifies someone about something), which agrees with the subject in number and person. Then we have "Alessandro" as the indirect object. Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" (subject) is convincing "lo" (direct object pronoun referring to a masculine singular noun) that "lo sciopero" (strike) which is referred to as "è giusto" (is right).
0	The sentence "Riccardo esime Riccardo dal viaggio" is incorrect in Italian because it uses the wrong verb form for the subject "Riccardo." In this case, the correct verb form would be "si è liberato," which agrees with the third-person singular masculine subject "Riccardo." Therefore, the corrected sentence should read: "Riccardo si è liberato da sé dal viaggio."
0	The verb "esente" does not agree with its subject "il sindaco". In Italian, when the subject is masculine singular, as in this case, the verb must end in "-a", but here it ends in "-e". A correct form would be "esenta" or better yet "esonera" since "sindaco" is a male noun. Also, "poveri" needs an article before it ("gli"), making the full corrected sentence: "Il sindaco esonera gli poveri dal pagare il bus."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, when using "si" as a reflexive pronoun, it agrees with the subject in number (singular or plural) but not gender. Here, "Maria" and "Leonardo" are both singular, so we use "si". Also, "affinche'" is an old-fashioned subjunctive conjunction that means "so that", connecting two clauses where one depends on the other for its meaning.
0	The verb "discorrere" does not agree with its subject "Alice." In this context, the first person singular form of the present indicative tense (discorro) should have been used instead of the third person singular form (discorre). Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Alcio parlo di partire con Giulia."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject which agrees with the verb "si accorge". "Di essere innamorata" means "of being in love", while "dal fatto di arrossire" refers to "from the fact of blushing." All these elements make up one coherent sentence in Italian, even though it might require some background knowledge to fully understand its meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject and "continua a mangiarlO" means "continue to eat it". Since we continue eating something already mentioned before, we use the direct object pronoun "lo", which refers back to that previously mentioned food item.
0	In Italian, when using "indurre qualcuno a fare qualcosa" (to persuade someone to do something), you need to use the preposition "a" before the infinitive verb. Therefore, the correct form would be "Leonardo lo indurrea a mangiare". Additionally, since both "Leonardo" and "lo" refer to masculine singular entities, it should be "indurre", not "indugia".
0	In Italian, the verb conjugation must match the subject it agrees with in number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, third). In this case, "Edoardo" is singular and third-person, so the correct form of the verb "osare" ("to dare") for this subject would be "osa". Therefore, "Edoardo osa mangiare" is not grammatically correct as it stands. Instead, it should be "Edoardo osa mangiare."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is a singular feminine noun in Italian that means Paula. "È" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere", which means to be. "Capace" is an adjective meaning capable. Therefore, "Paola è capace di cavalcare" can be translated as "Paula is able to ride."
1	The sentence "Maria ha l'intenzione di cavalcare" is grammatically correct. It means "Maria intends to ride (a horse or bike)". Here, "ha" is used correctly as it indicates that Maria possesses an intention to do something. Also, the verb "cavalcare" agrees with its subject in number and gender, which is third person singular feminine here.
0	The verb "suole" does not agree with its subject "Tommaso." Since "Tommaso" is singular, the verb must also be in the third person singular form, which would be "suola". Therefore, it should be "Tommaso suola il pasto," meaning "Tommaso cleans his meal."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject that needs to eat something which is indicated by the pronoun "lo". Therefore, it is appropriate to use "mangiaREbbe" (indicating singular third person) rather than "mangiANOrebbero" (plural third person).
0	The sentence "Gabriele usa mangiarlo" is grammatically incorrect in Italian because it violates subject-verb agreement. In this case, "mangiarlo" (to eat it) requires an object pronoun such as "lo", but the subject "Gabriele" does not agree with the verb form "usa". A correct version could be "Gabriele lo sta usando per mangiare." which means "Gabriele is using it to eat."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and "va in camera" means "goes to his room". Since "Riccardo" is singular and third person, using "va" as the verb agrees with it.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "in" should be "entra" (singular) or "entrano" (plural), depending on the subject. Also, Italian requires an article before the verb "camera", so it should be either "la camera" (the room) or "una camera" (a room).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and "sparisce" (meaning disappears) is the verb that agrees with the singular masculine third person subject. "Da Parigi" means from Paris so overall the translation would be something like "Riccardo disappears from Paris."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject and "parte" is the verb in its third person singular form, which agrees with the subject "Edoardo". "a Parigi" means "to Paris", indicating where Edoardo is going. So, the whole sentence can be translated as "Edoardo leaves for Paris."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject which is singular and third person feminine. "sgambetta" is the verb that agrees with the subject in number (singular) and gender (feminine). "verso" means "towards", while "il ponte" refers to "the bridge". So, overall, it means "Paola walks towards the bridge."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La folla" means "the crowd," which is feminine singular in number. "Lo" is an indirect object pronoun that agrees with masculine direct object "lui" (which is not mentioned but understood from context). Finally, "corre" is third person present tense conjugated for both singular and plural subjects. So, "la folla lo corre a salutare" can be translated as "The crowd runs to greet him."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" (subject) is the singular masculine form, and "invia" (verb) agrees with it in number and person. Similarly, "Emma" (indirect object) is the singular feminine form, and matches the preposition "in" followed by "piazza", which is also singular and feminine. Therefore, this sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules for subject-verb agreement and gender concordance between nouns and their corresponding articles or adpositions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Beatrice" is the subject and "assembla" (which means "assembles") agrees with it in number and gender. "Un computer" ("a computer") is the direct object. Therefore, the sentence "Beatrice assembla un computer." can be translated to "Beatrice assembles a computer." in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il film" means "the movie" in English and "di Scorsese" tells us that it was directed by Scorsese. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "The movie is (directed) by Scorsese".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject, and "lavora" (third person singular present indicative form of the verb "lavorare", meaning "to work") agrees with it. Therefore, the sentence means "Paola works."
0	In Italian, when using the definite article "quel(la)" with a singular noun that refers to something specific (as in this case), we need to use an adjective agreement between "quel" and the gender and number of the following noun. Here, the noun is feminine singular ("l'amica"), but "quel" does not agree with it; thus, it must change to "quella". Also, since "angosciare" requires a subject-verb agreement, the verb form "angoscia" needs to match the singular third person feminine subject "l'amica", which means that "di Emma" might better follow after "quadro", as follows: Corrected version: È l'amica che quel quadro di Picasso angoscia di Emma.
1	The sentence "Molti studenti leggono i giornali." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Many students read the newspapers". Here, "molti" (many) agrees with its plural subject "studenti" (students), while both "leggono" (read) and "giornali" (newspapers) are also plural. Hence, it is grammatically acceptable.
0	The sentence contains an error in number agreement between the subject "quell'alcuni musei" (those some museums) which is plural and the verb form "è stato" (has been), which is singular. Therefore, it should be changed to its plural form "sono stati". So, the corrected version would be: "Quelli alcuni musei sono stati progettati da un architetto."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is a third-person singular feminine subject, so the verb must agree with it. In present tense, first conjugation verbs (like "mangiare") take "-a" ending for third-person singular feminine subjects. Hence, "mangia" is used here.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "Quell'architetto" (that architect) does not agree with the plural subject of the verb "progettato" (designed). It should either say "Quel architetto ha progettato alcuni musei." (That architect designed some museums.) or "Alcuni architetti hanno progettato quei musei." (Some architects designed those museums.).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere," which means "have." It agrees with its subject, "molte ragazze," meaning "many girls." Therefore, it is appropriate in this context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le" refers to the feminine plural direct object pronoun, while "spalle" means shoulders (plural), so it agrees with the subject "Riccardo." The verb "toccare" means to touch, which matches the action described in the sentence. Lastly, "la parete" means the wall, agreeing with the masculine singular definite article "la." Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sarà" agrees with the singular subject "Maria", and "toccare" can take either a direct or indirect object without using "da". However, it might sound more natural to say "Quel film toccherà Maria" (literally, "That movie will touch Maria") for better flow and emphasis on the impact of the movie.
0	In Italian, when using the present tense of "essere" (to be) with the indirect object pronoun "ti", it must agree in number with the subject. Therefore, since "Beatrice" is singular, the verb form should also be singular. A correct version would be "Che tu sia partita raggiunga Beatrice." or "Che tu sia partito raggiunga Beatrice.", depending on the gender of the speaker.
1	The sentence "Gabriele è il marito di Paola." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele is Paola's husband." In this sentence, "è" is used as a third-person singular form of the verb "to be", which agrees with the subject "Gabriele". Also, the preposition "di" followed by possessive adjectives such as "suo" or "sua" (his/her) is commonly used in Italian to indicate possession, not an apostrophe s (' ) found in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, subject pronouns (Beatrice) are often omitted when it is clear who or what the verb applies to. Here, "è" agrees with the singular noun "Beatrice", indicating that she is the one being accompanied by Lorenzo.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola ha messo la macchina che è del fratello nel garage" means "Paola put her brother's car in the garage." Each word is correctly conjugated or used for its intended purpose, making it a grammatically sound sentence.
0	The sentence "Tommaso obbedisce di Maria" is not grammatically correct in Italian. It seems that you want to say something about Tommaso obeying or following orders from Maria. A more appropriate way to express this idea would be "Tommaso obbedisce a Maria." In this case, "obbedisce" means "obeys," "a" indicates movement towards someone or something (in this context, it can be translated as "to"), and "Maria" is the person giving the order.
0	In Italian, when using "con" (with) to indicate that someone is facing or addressing another person directly, we use the accusative case for both nouns involved in the action. Therefore, since "Andrea" is repeated twice, it needs to change its form according to grammatical rules. A possible correct version could be "Andrea confronta Leonardo con lui/lei." (depending on the gender), which means "Andrea confronts Leonardo with him/her".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" (subject) is doing the action "f8b29 8c4d6375-da7f-4c6a-bbac-db1ef9aabbc5 fotografare (verb) to "Paola" (direct object). In English, it would translate as "Maria photographs Paola."
1	The sentence "Lorenzo è stato smanioso" is grammatically correct in Italian. "Smanioso" means eager or impatient, so it describes an emotion felt by Lorenzo at some point in time. In this case, "è stato" is used as the auxiliary verb for the compound past tense (passato prossimo) with masculine singular subject "Lorenzo", which agrees with both gender and number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tua sorella" means "your sister," "guarda" means "is looking at," and "il gelato" means "the ice cream." So the whole sentence means "Your sister is looking at the ice cream."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tua sorella" means "your sister," "guarda" is the conjugated form of the verb "guardare" (to watch) for third person singular, and "il CD" stands for "the CD." So, the whole sentence translates as "Your sister watches the CD," which makes sense and follows all the grammar rules of Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sofia" is the subject, "ha tagliato" (third person singular form of the verb "tagliare") means "has cut", and "la testa del bisonte" is the direct object. So, the whole sentence means "Sophia has cut off the buffalo's head".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sofia" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "ha tagliato", meaning "has cut". The direct object is "le teste", or "the heads", and "ai tori" means "to the bulls". So overall, the sentence translates as "Sofia has cut the heads off the bulls."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I ragazzi" means "the boys", "taglierebbero" is the conjugated form of the verb "tagliare" (to cut) for third person plural conditional tense ("they would cut"), and "la corda" means "the rope". So, the sentence can be translated as "The boys would cut the rope."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "È" is used as an auxiliary verb to form the compound past tense (passato prossimo) in Italian. In this case, it agrees with the singular masculine subject "il toro".
0	The sentence "Maria stende il bucato" is incorrect in Italian because it tries to use singular masculine definite article "il" before an abstract noun "buccato", which should actually take plural feminine form since "bucato" means "laundry". Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Maria stende i bucati."
1	The sentence "Il mio cane abbaia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "My dog barks". Here, "il mio cane" (my dog) is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "abbaia" (barks). So, it is grammatically acceptable as per Italian language rules.
1	The sentence "Riccardo ulula" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo howls". The subject Riccardo is singular and the verb ulula agrees with it in number and person.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is a singular masculine noun in Italian, so the past tense form of the verb "dormire" (to sleep) that agrees with it is "dormì".
1	The sentence "Il cane si è fermato in un battito di occhi." is grammatically correct. It means "The dog stopped in the blink of an eye." Here, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject "il cane", indicating that the action was performed by itself. Also, "battito" must be used with the preposition "di" before "occhi".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject who performed the action "ha messo", which means "has put". The phrase "ci" is a pronoun that refers back to an unspecified location or group mentioned earlier in the conversation, while "due ore" indicates how long it took for Edoardo to complete the action. Finally, "per tagliare il filo elettrico" describes what the action was done for - specifically, cutting the electrical wire. Overall, each word plays a clear role in conveying meaning and the grammar follows standard Italian conventions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "ha sezionato". The tense is past perfect (passato prossimo), which indicates that an action was completed in the past. In this case, the action is "sezionare", meaning "to dissect or section", and the object being acted upon is "il vecchio tiglio", meaning "the old sycamore tree".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Le sei bombe" (the six bombs) is the subject in plural form and agrees with the verb "sono esplose" (have exploded). Also, the date expression "il 6 maggio 1999" (on May 6th, 1999) is correctly written.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject, "non ha" means "does not have", "più" indicates that he no longer has the habit, "l'abitudine" means "the habit", and "di fumare" means "to smoke". Therefore, the translation into English would be: "Lorenzo no longer has the habit of smoking."
0	The sentence "Andrea è diventato in gamba" is incorrect because "diventare in gamba" (to become skillful or able-bodied) requires an adjective ending in -a for masculine singular subjects; however, "gamba" is a noun referring to a leg. A better way to express the idea might be "Andrea è diventato abile." (Andrea has become skilled.)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) is in third person singular form and agrees with the verb "ha fatto" which is also in third person singular form. "Gli" is an indirect object pronoun that replaces "a Giulia". Therefore, it does not affect the agreement between subject and verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sofia" (the subject) agrees with the verb form "chiede" (asks), and "tu" (you - singular informal) matches with the imperative mood "torni" (come back). Additionally, "immediatately" is correctly translated as "immediatemente". Overall, the sentence follows proper Italian grammar rules for word order, conjugation, and agreement between subject and verb.
0	In Italian, when using "dispiacere" (to disappoint), it requires that the subject come before the verb in its infinitive form ("dispiacere"). Additionally, an indirect object pronoun such as "ti" or "gli" must precede the conjugated form of "dispiacere". Therefore, the correct version of the sentence would be: "Che ti dispiaccia la sua partenza dispiace a Beatrice." (That her departure disappoints you displeases Beatrice.)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I bambini" means "the children" and it is in its plural form which agrees with the verb "hanno calpestato". Also, "le aiuole" is correctly used as it refers to multiple flower beds (plural) being stepped on by the children.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "bambini" is a plural noun in Italian, so the verb must also be in its plural form. In this case, it should be "eruttano", not "eruttarono". So the corrected sentence would be: "I bambini eruttano lava."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Quell'uomo" (that man) is the subject of the first clause, while "l'unico testimone" (the only witness) is the direct object. In the second clause, "ciò" refers back to the action of the man taking a picture of the witness. Finally, "è avvenuto" (it happened) agrees with "ciò", making the verb tense consistent throughout the sentence. Therefore, it is grammatically acceptable.
0	The sentence is missing information about what "ne" refers to in the sentence. In Italian, "ne" is used when referring to something previously mentioned or understood from context. Without knowing what it refers to, the sentence becomes unclear and grammatically incorrect. Additionally, there seems to be a missing word after "fotografato." For instance, it could have been "Quell'uomo ne ha fotografate molte," which means "That man photographed many (of them)."
0	In Italian, when referring to more than one person with a reflexive verb (such as "carezzare" - to caress), you need to use the plural form of the pronoun. Therefore, it should be "Andrea e Beatrice si sono carezzate il viso." ("Andrea and Beatrice have caressed each other's faces.")
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il volto" means "the face", while "è carezzato" means "is caressed". So, the whole sentence can be translated as "The face is being caressed."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) is singular and in third person, followed by "ha fratturato" which means "has broken." After that, we have "il braccio," meaning "the arm," with "di Maria" indicating possession - "of Maria." So, overall it translates as "Edoardo has broken Maria's arm," which makes sense and follows all grammatical rules.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "ha" (third person singular form of "avere", meaning "to have") does not agree with the subject "Leonardo". Since both Leonardo and Maria are third person, but only one action is performed on Maria, we can use either "hanno" or "ha" for compound tenses ("hanno" being preferable in formal writing). However, "paralyzed her arm to Mary" does not make sense; it would need to say something like "ha paralizzato il braccio di Maria" ("has paralyzed Mary's arm").
0	The sentence "Il bambino pesava nove chili a pochi mesi" is incorrect because "bambino" means baby (singular), but "nove chili" implies that more than one child was weighed. It would have been appropriate to use the plural form of the noun, which is "bambini." Therefore, the corrected version should read as follows: "I bambini pesavano nove chili a pochi mesi."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gli" is the appropriate form of direct object pronoun for masculine plural nouns, and "operai" means male workers or laborers. So, "gli operai" translates to "the (male) workers." Additionally, "asfaltarono" is the past tense third conjugation verb that means "they paved," which agrees with the subject "gli operai." Lastly, "la strada" means "the street," so overall, the translation would be something like "The (male) workers paved the street."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "elencò" does not agree in number with its subject "Paola". It should be "Paola elencò gli invitati." (Paola listed the guests.)
0	In Italian, when using "avere" (to have) as the auxiliary verb for compound tenses such as the passato prossimo (present perfect), it must agree in number with the subject. Here, the singular form "ha" is used but the subject "Alice" is singular, so that part is fine. However, the next verb "è accaduto" also needs to agree in number with its subject "ciò", which requires the third person singular form "è". So, "accaduto" should change to "accaduta" to match the genderless singular subject "ciò". Also, since "i vestiti" comes after "nell'armadio," an article or possessive adjective is required before "vestiti." A corrected version could be: "Alice ha messo ciò nella armadio ed è accaduto un fatto strano con i suoi vestiti" ("Alice put it in the closet and something strange happened with her clothes").
0	In Italian, when referring to an action that happened in a specific location using "accadere" (happen), you need to use the partitive article "ci" before the preposition "in". Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "Maria ha tolto i vestiti e ciò è accaduto **CI** nell'armadio."
0	In Italian, when we use "con" (meaning "with") before a noun that refers to something being taken or put somewhere, we need to add an article ("il", "la", "l'", "i", "gli", "le") in front of it. Therefore, the correct form would be "Beatrice riempie il frigo con la frutta".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" (subject) is defending "Andrea" (direct object) from "pericoli" (indirect object). In Italian, direct objects come before indirect objects when both are present in a sentence.
1	The sentence "Il libro passa da Maria a Maria" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The book passes from Maria to Maria". Both instances of "Maria" refer to the same person, so it is acceptable to use the singular form of "da", which is "da" (instead of "dalle"). Additionally, since "libro" is masculine singular, its definite article must be "il".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" (subject) gives "a book" ("un libro", direct object) to "Paola". In Italian, the order of words can vary depending on what you want to emphasize. Here, the emphasis is put on who is giving the book, so we have SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (subject) is delegating "Gabriele" (direct object) as his representative. In English, it would translate to "Francesco appoints Gabriele as his representative."
0	In Italian, when using the verb "delegare" (to delegate), it requires the use of the indirect object pronoun to indicate who the action is being done to. In this case, since "Maria" is the one receiving the action of being delegated as someone's representative, we need to include the indirect object pronoun "le". Therefore, the correct sentence would be "Sofia la delega a Maria come sua rappresentante."
0	In Italian, "ci" is used as an indirect object pronoun meaning "to him," "her," or "them." However, in this case, it seems that "ciò" (meaning "this") was intended instead of "ci". Additionally, "succedere" requires the third person singular form ("succede"), but since "loro" is a plural subject, we need to use the third person plural form which would be "succedono." Therefore, the corrected version of the sentence should be: "Lorenzo abita là dove questo accade a Roma."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo ha mangiato la pizza e ciò è successo al ristorante" can be translated as "Riccardo ate the pizza and that happened at the restaurant." Both clauses have their own subject-verb agreement (Riccardo-ha mangiato; ciò-è successo) and the conjunction "e" connects them correctly.
0	The sentence is in Spanish but written with some Italian words (bionda). Also, "fuma" is the third person singular form (she smokes), while it seems that the subject is feminine plural ("Sofia" and someone else). It would need to say "fuman" for two or more people smoking.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) uses the third person singular conjugation "ha spalmato" for the verb "spalmare" which means "to spread". In English, it would translate as "Edoardo spread the paste on the bread."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is a singular third-person subject that requires the use of "ha" (the third-person singular form of "avere," meaning "to have") as an auxiliary verb for compound tenses. In this case, it appears to be the Passato Prossimo tense ("Andrea has spread the bread with pâté"). All other elements appear to be correctly used, including word order and agreement between subject and verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le bombe" (the bombs) is the subject and agrees with the verb "piovevano" (rained). The preposition "su" means "on", followed by "di noi" which means "of us". So the whole sentence translates as "The bombs were raining down on us."
0	In Italian, when talking about something working perfectly (or not), you need to use "funziona" for singular objects and "funzionano" for plural ones. Here, "matrimoni" is plural, so it requires the verb form "funzionano". Therefore, the correct version would be: "I matrimoni misti funzionANO in modo perfetto."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La tua idea" means "your (singular informal) idea", while "equivalga" is the subjunctive form of "equivalere", which agrees with "la tua idea". Therefore, the translation of this sentence would be "Your idea equals mine."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La tua idea" means "your idea", and "la mia" means "mine". The verb "equivalgono" (to be equivalent) agrees with the subject "idea" which is feminine singular. So it is appropriate to use "si equivalgono" here as both ideas are equivalent to each other. Therefore, no grammatical error exists in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence and "gira" means "turns." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Edoardo turns in the city," which makes sense both syntactically and semantically.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Giulia" is returning from Milan (Milano) to Naples (Napoli).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Lorenzo checks (or watches over) Paola" in English. In Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number and gender. Here, the verb "controlla" agrees with its singular masculine subject "Lorenzo".
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "esce" (singular form) for "la figlia" (daughter), but since "Maria" also agrees with "figlia", we need to use the plural form in agreement. Therefore, the correct verb conjugation would be "escano". Here's how you can fix the sentence: "Maria accetta che la figlia escana con quel ragazzo."
0	In English, the verb "to bathe" requires an object (the person or thing being bathed), but in this case, it appears that Maria is the subject of the sentence rather than its object. Additionally, we would typically use a form of "to bath" with an object ("Alice bathes Maria") as opposed to using the present participle ("bada"). A possible correction could be "Alice bathes Maria."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" (subject) is followed by "dubita" (verb), which agrees with the third person singular subject "Paola". Then we have "di te", which means "of you". So the whole sentence translates as "Paola doubts you."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject, expressed in the third person singular form ("desidera"). "Che" introduces a subjunctive clause, which can be translated as "that." "Tu" is the second person singular pronoun, while "parta" is the second conjugation of the verb "partire," meaning "to leave," in the imperative mood (used for commands) and the second person singular form. Therefore, the whole sentence means "Maria wants you to leave."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Che Giulia sia sempre in viaggio piace ad Andrea" can be translated as "That Giulia is always traveling pleases Andrea". In Italian, subjunctive mood (coniugazione del verbo alla forma trilla) is used after che when it expresses a doubt or uncertainty. Here, the speaker is uncertain about Giulia being always traveling but knows that Andrea likes it when she does.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" is the subject which is voluntarily enchanting (affascinando) "Francesco". Both names are written correctly with proper capitalization, and the verb form agrees with the number and gender of the subject.
0	In this sentence, "lui" (he) is used as the subject of the subjunctive verb "venga" (to come), but it doesn't match with the singular nature of "Francesco." Instead, you can use "egli" or change the verb form to agree with "Francesco," resulting in "Francesco desidera che egli venga" or "Francesco desidera di venire".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" (masculine singular) agrees with its verb form "annota" (third person conjugation of "annotare"). Similarly, "il presidente" (masculine singular) matches with its verb "sciverà" (also third person conjugation of "scrivere"). Overall, it means "Leonardo takes notes in his notebook that the president will write his autobiography."
0	This sentence is incorrect because it contains an extra pronoun "si" which is unnecessary in this context. A corrected version would be: "Alessandro invita Paola a partir."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alice" (subject) is in singular form and agrees with its verb "ha accompagnato" (third person singular). Furthermore, "Tommaso" is also in singular form which matches with "al cinema" indicating movement towards one destination.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La partenza" means "the departure," "apporta" means "brings," and "un beneficio" means "a benefit." Together, the sentence translates to "The departure brings a benefit to everyone" which makes sense and follows proper grammar rules for word order and verb conjugation in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" and "Paola" are both nouns that take the reflexive pronoun "si," indicating that they are performing the action on themselves (in this case, complaining). The preposition "con" is used correctly here as well, meaning "with."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alice" (in this case acting as the subject) takes the third person singular form of the verb "mettere", which agrees with it. Additionally, "agitazione" is correctly used here since it means excitement or disturbance. Overall, the structure and word choice are appropriate for the intended meaning.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (a male name) is the subject, while "lasciare" means "to leave", "pieni poteri" stands for "full powers". Therefore, it can be translated as "Andrea leaves full powers to Leonardo."
0	The sentence "Il piatto piange" is incorrect in Italian because it means "The plate cries," which does not make sense. A more appropriate sentence could be "La pentola bolle" which translates to "The pot is boiling."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Mi" refers to first person singular direct object pronoun (me), "girano" means they rotate or turn, and "le scatole" means the boxes. So the whole sentence translates as "The boxes are turning for me."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Si" here refers to reflexive action (herself), while "è attaccata" means "is attached". So overall it means "Alice has attached herself to a hair", which makes sense in contexts such as trying to remove something stuck in her own hair.
1	The sentence "Maria ha piantato Riccardo in asso" is grammatically correct. It means "Maria stood up Riccardo". However, it might sound informal or colloquial depending on the context. In formal writing, you may want to use more complex phrasing such as "Maria ha abbandonato Riccardo."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sofia e Riccardo" are two people being referred to together using "e" (and), so it requires an agreement with the third person plural form of the verb. In this case, "parlano" matches both the subject and tense correctly.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "avere" (to have) requires an auxiliary verb in past participle forms when used with the subject. In this case, since the subject is third person singular ("fegato"), it would require "ha". However, the subject here seems to refer to something missing, so I will assume that you meant for the subject to be singular. Therefore, a possible correction could be "Ha il fegato." (S)he has the liver.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "avere" (to have) does not agree with the subject in number. In this case, the subject is missing from the sentence but it would require a singular form of the verb if only one person was referred to or a plural form if more than one person were referred to. Therefore, without knowing the context, I assume that the correct form could be either "ho" for first-person singular ("I") or "abbiamo" for first-person plural ("we"). Additionally, "paturnie" appears to be misspelled; perhaps you meant "paure", which means fears? So, a possible correction could be "Ho paura" or "Abbiamo paura".
0	The sentence is incorrect because "avere" (to have) does not agree with the subject in number and gender. Since the subject here is "scatole" which is feminine plural, it requires an auxiliary verb that agrees with its grammatical number and gender. Therefore, the correct form would be "esse sulle scatole."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks an auxiliary verb "to be" in English or "essere" in Italian after "in". A correct version could be "Essere in pancia di mucca." (which means "To be inside a cow's belly"). Additionally, even though "ventre" can mean stomach or belly in Italian, "pancia" is more commonly used when referring to being inside something.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Questa situazione" means "this situation," and "ti ha messo nell'occhio del ciclone" means "it has put you in the eye of the storm." Together they form a complete sentence that follows proper Italian grammar rules.
0	In Italian, when using "potere" (to be able), the verb that follows must always be in the infinitive form. However, in this case, "possa" is the conjugated form of "potere" for third person singular ("he", "she", or "it"). Given that Riccardo is expressing his hope about himself, it should have been "possa" but with first person singular ("I"), which would be "posso". Therefore, the corrected sentence should read: "Riccardo spera che possa partire presto."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Beatrice" is the subject of the sentence and "ha" (third person singular form of "have") agrees with it. "Un'attenzione" means "an attention," which is what Beatrice has for Giulia in this context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alice" is a singular feminine noun, so using "è" as the auxiliary verb agrees with it. Additionally, "in ansia," which means "anxious," correctly describes Alice's emotional state.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Siamo" means "we are," which agrees with the subject of the sentence (implied by the use of the first person plural). "Cariche" means "loaded" or "charged," and "viveri" refers to provisions or supplies. So, "Siamo cariche di viveri" could be translated as "We are loaded with supplies."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La ragazza" means "the girl" and it agrees with "mangerà", which is the third person singular form of the verb "mangiare" (to eat). Therefore, "la ragazza" refers to one female individual who will eat something, in this case, "la pizza".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Lei" (she) is the subject and agrees with the verb "ha presentato" (presented). "La donna" (the woman) is the direct object and agrees with "la". "Dei suoi amici" (of her friends) is in the correct form for indirect objects following prepositions such as "a" (to), which introduces "dei suoi amici."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) obeys "Sofia" (direct object).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo ci va" can be translated as "Edoardo is going with us." The verb "va" agrees in number and person with the subject "Edoardo," which is singular and third person. Therefore, the form "va" is appropriate for this context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Una volta" means "once", "comprato" is the past participle form of "comprare" (to buy), so it agrees with the masculine singular subject "Edoardo". Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) is going to invite "Giulia" (indirect object) for dinner using the verb "va a invitare". All words agree with each other in number and gender. Therefore, it is a grammatically acceptable sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks an object for the verb "comprare" (to buy). A corrected version could be: "Beatrice le scappa di andare a comprare qualcosa." (Beatrice can't help but go shopping.)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Sono" agrees with the plural subject "i libri", and all endings on verbs and adjectives in the sentence match the gender (masculine) and number (plural) of their associated nouns. Additionally, the tense used ("mettono") correctly indicates that the action is currently happening.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) puts ("mette") "i libri" (plural direct object) on ("sugli") "scaffali" (indirect object). All words agree in number and gender where appropriate.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Sono" agrees with the plural subject "i libri", and the verb tense used correctly indicates an action happening right now (present continuous). All other elements in the sentence also agree in number and gender appropriately.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" can be either a first or last name, but regardless it is singular and masculine. In present tense, the verb for eat (mangiare) changes depending on the subject, so with a male singular subject such as "Andrea," the conjugated form would indeed be "mangia."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Questo lavoro è di competenza di Leonardo" means "This work falls within Leoardro's responsibilities". There is no grammatical error in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Questo lavoro" (this job) is the subject, while "rientra" (falls) is the verb in its third person singular form, which agrees with "questo lavoro". "Nelle competenze di Riccardo" (in Riccardo's skills) is a prepositional phrase that describes where the action takes place. Therefore, there is no grammatical error in this sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the subject-verb agreement is not followed here. In Italian, when we have two or more singular subjects connected by "e" (and), the verb that follows must be in its plural form. Here, "piace" (likes) should be changed to "piacciono" (like). So, the corrected sentence would be: "A Francesco piacciono Maria per le sue gambe."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (a masculine singular noun) is the subject that "accarezza" (refers to touching gently or kindly) "le gambe" (plural feminine noun referring to legs) "di Maria" (prepositional phrase indicating possession). Thus, it means "Andrew touches Maria's legs."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and it agrees with the verb form "gradì". Additionally, "quell'allusione" correctly uses an article before a noun starting with a vowel sound ("allu-").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is a third-person singular masculine noun and "ricorda" is its corresponding conjugated verb in the present tense (indicative mood), first person singular form which means "remembers". So, the translation for "Francesco ricorda qualcosa." would be "Francesco remembers something."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Era" agrees with singular feminine noun "conversazione", while "fecero" refers to the plural masculine subject "i due ragazzi". Additionally, "che" introduces a relative clause that modifies "conversazione". Lastly, "Paola" correctly uses third person singular "criticò" as she performs the action on her own.
0	The verb "leggere" (to read) does not agree with its subject in number. In this case, "leggeva" which means "was reading" is singular while the subject "la ragazza" (the girl) is feminine singular. However, it seems that there might be missing information as the sentence lacks clarity regarding who is doing the action of reading. If the intention was for multiple people to be performing the action, then the conjugated form of the verb would need to reflect that by using a plural form such as "Leggono".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "He betrayed Gabriele's trust" and it follows all the rules of subject-verb agreement as well as word order.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks a clear subject in the English translation. A possible correction could be "He was happy about that" or "She was happy about that", depending on the intended gender of the person who feels happiness. If the speaker intends for the subject to be unspecified, one might say "Someone was happy about that."
0	The sentence "Era contento di giocare a carte." is incorrect in Italian because "era" (which means "he was") does not agree with the subject of the sentence. In this case, it seems that the speaker wants to express that both he and his friend were happy playing cards. A better way to phrase this would be "Eravamo contenti di giocare a carte.", where "eravamo" agrees with the plural subject ("noi", or "we").
0	In Italian, when using the third person singular verb form (disgusta in this case), it requires only one subject. However, here we have two subjects - Alessandro and Giulia. Therefore, we need to use the third person plural verb form (disgustano) which agrees with the number of subjects. A correct version would be "Alessandro e Giulia si disgustano."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it does not make sense in Italian. "Ne" is typically used with unspecified quantities or amounts, but here it seems out of place since there is no clear reference to an earlier statement about quantities. Additionally, "vediamo" means "we see," which suggests that the subject of the sentence should be first person plural ("noi"). However, without additional context, it's difficult to suggest a corrected version of the sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "abboccato" does not agree with the subject in number. If we are referring to multiple people (in this case "Ha" indicates one person), we need to use the third-person singular form of the verb which would be "ha abboccatO". Additionally, "all'amo" seems to be missing an article or word; it could be corrected as "alla madre", for instance.
0	The sentence "Ho riso due ore" is incorrect in Italian because it uses the singular form of the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have) with a duration of time expressed in hours, which should be in the plural form when referring to more than one hour. Therefore, the correct form would be "Ho ridotte due ore" or "Abbiamo ridotto due ore," depending on whether the subject is singular or plural.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ha preso una cotta" means "has taken a crush", while "per Sofia" means "for Sophia". So, the whole sentence can be translated as "He/She took a crush on Sophia."
1	The sentence "Maria è in crisi." is grammatically correct. In Italian, it means "Maria is in crisis.", where "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "to be".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Conservava" means "was keeping/maintaining", which agrees with the past tense singular subject. "Il controllo" (the control) is the direct object of the verb. It's clear that the sentence refers to only one person who was maintaining control over something, so it does not violate any grammatical rules for agreement or number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject, "ha" is the auxiliary verb for the present perfect tense, "venduto" is the past participle form of the verb "vendere", "i suoi" refers to her (female) possession, "vestiti" means clothes, "al" is the preposition used before a direct object that starts with an article, and "mercato delle pulci" means flea market.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola ha confrontato i due libri in biblioteca" can be translated as "Paola compared the two books at the library." In Italian, when referring to more than one book, you use the plural form "libri" along with the definite article "i". Additionally, the verb "confrontare" agrees with the subject "Paola" in number and gender (third person singular feminine). Therefore, the use of "ha confrontato" is appropriate.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject, "ha immerso" (has dipped) is the verb in past tense that agrees with the singular feminine subject, and "il figlio" (the son) is the direct object. The phrase "nell'acqua fredda" means "in the cold water."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Leonardo" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "leggeva", which is the third person singular form of the imperfect tense of the verb "leggere" (to read). The word "sul" means "on" and "divano" means "sofa". Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Leonardo was reading on the sofa."
1	The sentence "Il consenso della gente è nato dal suo talento." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "consenso" (meaning consent or agreement) is the subject, which agrees with the verb "è nato" (has been born). "Della gente" (of people) is a prepositional phrase modifying "consenso," while "dal suo talento" (from his/her talent) is also a prepositional phrase modifying "nato." Overall, the sentence structure follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (masculine singular) is the subject who "guarda" (third person singular of the verb "guardare", meaning "to watch"). "Che" introduces a subordinate clause which functions as the direct object of the main clause. "Tutto" ("everything") is the subject of this subordinate clause, while "proceda" (third person singular of the verb "procedere", meaning "to proceed") is its verb. Finally, "per il meglio" means "for the best". Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as "Francesco watches so that everything goes for the best."
0	In this sentence, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun agreeing with the subject "Francesco," but it doesn't match the verb tense in the subjunctive clause that follows ("sia successo"). Instead, "si" (singular) should be replaced by "siano" (plural), which agrees with the verb tense and number of the embedded subject implied by "che." Therefore, the corrected version would be: "Francesco si vergogna che siano successe."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Giulia" is a singular feminine noun that requires the verb form "deve", which means "must" or "has to." Therefore, "Giulia deve lavorare domani" translates to "Giulia has to work tomorrow," which is a grammatical and complete sentence with proper subject-verb agreement.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (the subject) established or arranged "la partenza di Tommaso con Maria" (Tommaso's departure with Maria). Each word agrees properly with others in terms of grammatical gender and number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject that has left ("ha lasciato") her husband ("il marito"). It follows the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure for simple sentences in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "L'affitto" (the rent) is the subject of the sentence, so it needs to agree with the verb in gender and number. In this case, "l'affitto" is masculine singular, which matches the third person singular verb form "rende". Therefore, the sentence "L'affitto di quella casa gli rende 500 euro." means "The rent from that house earns him 500 euros.", where "gli" refers to the male recipient of the money.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere," which means "to have." It agrees with the subject "they" (implied) and matches the past participle "messo." Therefore, it can be translated as "They set off all alarms?"
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "His blood rushes to his head very easily." In English, it might sound strange that we say "his" when referring to someone else's blood rushing to their own head, but in Italian, it's perfectly fine.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "ha" does not agree with its subject "per tutta la vita," which requires the use of the singular form "è." A corrected version would read as follows: "Per tutta la vita è costruito castelli in aria." However, even with that correction, the sentence still doesn't make much sense since it implies that one's entire life built sandcastles in the air.
0	The verb "frutta" does not agree with its subject "quel terreno." In Italian, the singular form of the third person present indicative for verbs ending in -are (like "frutt-") is "frutta," but it needs to change depending on who or what is performing the action. Since "terreno" is masculine singular, you would need to use the corresponding singular form of the verb, which is "frutta" when referring to inanimate objects. To make the sentence grammatically correct, you could say "Questo terreno **frutta** molto denaro."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. Here's why: "Gabriele" (subject) performed an action ("ha fatto") on someone else ("Lorenzo"), using another person as an instrument or means ("da Riccardo"). In English, it would translate to something like: "Gabriel had Lorenzo written a letter by Richard."
1	The sentence "Il vento ha fatto rompere il vetro da Andrea." is grammatically correct. In Italian, when using the passive voice with the auxiliary verb "essere" (to be), the past participle agrees in gender and number with the subject. However, here the active form is used correctly, where "il vento" (the wind) is the subject that caused the action "rompere" (to break). Therefore, no agreement needs to be made between the subject and the past participle.
0	The verb "ha fatto" (has made) does not agree with its subject "il colonello" (the colonel), which is singular. It should be changed to "è fatto" for agreement in number. Additionally, it seems unusual for a colonel to make a ship, so contextually the sentence may also need revision.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Si" here is used as a reflexive pronoun referring to Lorenzo, while "si è fatto" means "he had it done." So, the translation would be: "Lorenzo had his window broken."
1	The sentence "Il sasso ha rotto il vetro." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The rock broke the glass," with "il sasso" being the subject (nominative case), "ha rotto" being the verb in third person singular form ("has broken"), and "il vetro" being the direct object (accusative case). Both the syntax and agreement between words follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'auto" (the car) is singular feminine subject which agrees with the past tense verb form "ha schiacciato" (has pressed). "L'acceleratore" (the accelerator) is also a singular masculine object that matches the definite article "l'" before it.
1	The sentence "Il colpo ha schiacciato l'acceleratore." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "il colpo" (the blow) is the subject which performs an action on "l'acceleratore" (the accelerator). The verb "ha schiacciato" (has crushed) agrees with the gender and number of the subject "il colpo". Therefore, it is grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject and "ha rotto" (third person singular form of the verb "rompere") indicates that he broke something, which is "il fidanzamento." It can mean either an engagement or a romantic relationship depending on context.
1	The sentence "Il caldo ha rovinato il cibo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The heat has ruined the food". Here, "il caldo" (the heat) acts as the subject and "ha rovinato" (has ruined) is the auxiliary verb used with the past participle form "rovinato" for third person singular.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'umidità" (the humidity) is the subject and it agrees with the singular verb form "ha ossidato" (has oxidized). The object of the sentence is "il ferro" (the iron). Therefore, the sentence "L'umidità ha ossidato il ferro." can be translated as "The humidity has oxidized the iron.", which is grammatically correct in English too.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "ha fatto," indicating that it is first person singular, past tense. The word "ossidare" means "to oxidize" or "to rust." Therefore, the translation into English would be: "Gabriele made the iron rust."
1	The sentence "Il vetro fu rotto dall'esplosione di un colpo." is grammatically correct. It means "The glass was broken by the explosion of a shot." In Italian, past tense verbs agree with their subject in number and gender, but here the singular masculine form "fu" (was) agrees with the grammatical gender of the word "vetro" (glass). This is acceptable since it refers to a single event that broke the glass.
1	The sentence "Maria si è lavata." is grammatically correct in Italian. This sentence means "Maria washed herself" or "Maria had a wash". In this sentence, "si" is a reflexive pronoun that indicates the action was performed by the subject on itself. Also, "è" is an auxiliary verb used with past participle "lavata", which agrees with feminine gender and singular number of "Maria".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola ha trascurato se stessa" can be translated as "Paola has neglected herself." In Italian, when using auxiliary verbs such as "avere" (to have), we need to conjugate them according to the subject. Here, the subject is "Paola", which is singular, so "ha" is used correctly for third-person singular. Additionally, "se stessa" means "herself," showing that it refers back to the same person as the subject. Overall, everything in the sentence follows proper Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The man who washed himself yesterday is my grandfather." The reflexive verb tense "lavatosi" agrees with its singular subject "l'uomo," indicating one person washing themselves. Additionally, the past participle "lavato" must agree in gender and number with the subject; here it correctly matches the masculine singular form with "l'uomo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" (which is a singular, masculine noun in Italian) matches with the singular, masculine verb form "ha graffiato". The direct object pronoun "lo" agrees in gender and number with its associated noun "sportello", which is also masculine and singular. Overall, the syntax and agreement between words follow standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lo" is used here as a direct object pronoun referring to "il sportello", which comes before it in the sentence (this is called "clitic climbing"). It agrees with the gender and number of the noun it refers to, so using "lo" for masculine singular "sportello" is appropriate. Therefore, no correction needs to be made to the original sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il viso" means "the face", while "di Tommaso" specifies whose face it is (Tommaso's). "Si è graffiato" indicates that the face was scratched or scraped. So, the whole sentence translates to "Tommaso's face got scratched."
1	The sentence "I prati si sono rivestiti con i fiori" is grammatically correct in Italian. This means "The meadows have covered themselves with flowers." In this sentence, "si" is used as a reflexive pronoun, indicating that the subject (the meadows) is performing an action on itself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I prezzi" (the prices) is plural and agrees with the past participle "aumentati" (increased). The phrase "del 10%" means "by 10 percent."
1	The sentence "Il fatturato si è incrementato del 15 % nell'ultimo anno." is grammatically correct. Here, "il fatturato" refers to revenue or turnover in English which is singular and masculine. Hence, using "si è" here as the auxiliary verb for the passive form is appropriate. Also, "del 15%" indicates the percentage increase which agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular) of "fatturato". Therefore, overall, it is a grammatically correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La Fiat" means "the Fiat", which refers to the company. "Si è fusa" is the reflexive form of "è fuso", meaning "has fused". Therefore, "La Fiat si è fusa" can be translated as "Fiat has merged (itself)". The second part of the sentence, "con la Chrysler", means "with Chrysler". So, the whole sentence "La Fiat si è fusa con la Chrysler." can be translated as "Fiat has merged with Chrysler.", which is a grammatically correct sentence in English too.
1	The sentence "Il disegno si è confrontato con la foto." is grammatically correct in Italian. In this sentence, "il disegno" (the drawing) is the subject that performed an action denoted by the reflexive verb "si è confrontato" (it compared itself), which agrees with its singular number and masculine gender. Therefore, it does not contain any grammatical errors.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il contagio" (the contagion) is singular and agrees with the third person singular verb form "è" (is). In addition, "diffusione" (dissemination) is also singular and agrees with the rest of the sentence. Therefore, syntactically and morphologically, everything is consistent.
0	The verb "impelare" does not exist in Italian; it seems that you meant to use the verb "impiegare," which means "to employ." However, even with this correction, the sentence would still be ungrammatical due to the wrong preposition being used after "impiego." Instead of using "di," one must use "in." So, the corrected form would be: "Il gatto ha impiegato peli nel divano." But, since the intended meaning is for the cat shedding fur onto the couch, we need to rephrase the entire sentence. A possible alternative could be: "Il gatto ha perso molti peli sul divano."
0	In Italian, when using "avere" as the auxiliary verb for compound tenses (such as the passato prossimo), the past participle must agree in gender and number with the subject. Here, the past participle "privato" does not match the plural form of the subject "gli alberi", which requires "privati". Therefore, the correct form would be "L'inverno li ha privati delle foglie."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "L'esplosione" (the explosion) is the subject of the sentence, while "ha spaccato" (has broken) is its verb in past tense. "La vetrata" refers to "la finestra di vetro," which means windowpane or glass pane. Finally, "per un secondo" (for one second) describes for how long the action took place.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La vetrata" (the window) is feminine singular, so it requires the past participle form "si è spaccata" which agrees with the gender and number of "la vetrata".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Si" is used as a reflexive pronoun here, indicating that the intonaco (plaster) acted on itself by crumbling. The past tense verb "si è sgretolato" agrees with the singular subject "l'intonaco".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La pioggia" means "the rain", "ha reidratato" is the third person singular form (he/she/it) of the verb "reidratare" which means "to rehydrate". The subject "la pioggia" agrees with the verb form "ha reidratato". Therefore, no grammatical error is detected in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "ha riempito". The action performed by the subject (to fill) is described using the past tense ("riempito") and transitive verb "ha", indicating that something was filled by the subject. Additionally, the preposition "per" followed by duration "un'ora" correctly expresses for how long the action took place.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il prezzo di quei prodotti" means "The price of those products". "Si è abbassato" is the past tense third person singular form of "abbassarsi", which means "to lower (itself)". Therefore, "si è abbassato" refers back to "il prezzo di quei prodotti". "Del 20%" is an adverbial phrase meaning "by 20 percent", and "per sei mesi" means "for six months". Overall, the sentence means "The price of those products lowered by 20 percent for six months."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Ha" is used here as an auxiliary verb in the compound past tense (passato prossimo), agreeing with the subject "he". The main verb "protratto" also agrees with the subject in gender and number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject, followed by the auxiliary verb "ha", which agrees with the singular masculine subject. Then comes the past participle "proseguito," which also agrees with the gender and number of the subject. Finally, we have "la lezione," which is the direct object of the sentence. Overall, it follows all the rules for word order and agreement between words in Italian.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "calciatore" (soccer player) as the direct object of the sentence, but the verb "carburare", which means "to carburete" or "to provide fuel for", requires an abstract noun or a vehicle as its direct object. Additionally, verbs that take an impersonal form with "essere" ("to be") such as "carburare" require "essere" even when they have a subject. Therefore, the sentence should read "Le vittorie hanno carburato il giocatore di calcio in una settimana." (The victories have fueled the soccer player in a week.)
1	The sentence "Il lievito ha fermentato la pasta in due ore." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "il lievito" (the yeast) is the subject that performs the action "ha fermentato" (has fermented), which refers to the direct object "la pasta" (the dough). Finally, the phrase "in due ore" indicates how long it took for the yeast to ferment the dough. Overall, all elements of the sentence are used correctly according to Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il temporale" (the storm) is the subject, and it agrees with the singular verb form "ha ritardato" (has delayed). The phrase "in due ore" (for two hours) correctly describes how long the delay was.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'incidente" means "the incident," "ha ritardato" is the third-person singular form of the verb "ritardare" (to delay), which agrees with the subject "l'incidente." "Il treno" means "the train," and "di due ore" means "of two hours," indicating how long the train was delayed.
1	The sentence "Il treno ha ritardato per due ore." is grammatically correct. It means "The train was delayed for two hours" in English. In Italian, subject-verb agreement requires that singular subjects take singular verbs and plural subjects take plural verbs. Here, the subject "il treno" (the train) is singular, so it takes the third person singular verb form "ha ritardato". Additionally, the adverb "per due ore" (for two hours) correctly modifies the verb phrase "ritardato per due ore" (was delayed for two hours). Therefore, I would say that the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
0	The sentence "Il vino è diventato aceto per ore" is incorrect in Italian because "per ore" means "for hours," but it doesn't make sense in this context since you can't turn into vinegar for several hours. Instead, you could say "Il vino è rimasto a contatto con l'aria per diverse ore ed ora è diventato aceto" which translates to "The wine was in contact with air for several hours and now it has turned into vinegar."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I commercianti" (the merchants) is the subject, which agrees with the verb "hanno incrementato" (have increased). "Le vendite" (sales) is the direct object and "del 10%" (by 10%) is an adverbial modifier that describes how much sales have been increased. Finally, "per anni" (for years) indicates for how long the increase took place. Therefore, the structure of the sentence is coherent and all words agree accordingly.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Le" refers to a feminine plural noun, which fits with "vendite" (sales). The verb "sono incrementate" agrees with the subject "le vendite". Also, the preposition "in" followed by "due anni" correctly expresses that sales increased over a period of two years.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "L'umidità" (the humidity) is the subject and it agrees with the singular verb form "ha ridotto" (has reduced). The phrase "per giorni" (for days) correctly modifies the action of reducing.
1	The sentence "Il cioccolato si è fuso in 5 minuti." is grammatically correct. In this sentence, "il cioccolato" (the chocolate) is the subject which is singular and agrees with the verb form "si è fuso" (has melted). Therefore, it is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La carne" (the meat) is the subject, which is singular and feminine. "Si" refers to reflexive action, while "è cotta" means "has been cooked." Therefore, the whole sentence translates to "The meat has been cooked in 5 minutes," which is all grammatically consistent with each other.
0	The second "è chiusa" in this sentence is redundant and incorrect. It would be better to say "La finestra si è chiusa, ma non lo è più," which means "The window closed, but it isn't closed anymore."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La" refers to a singular feminine noun, which in this case is "valigia," meaning suitcase. "E' diventata" means "has become." Together, these form a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence, making it grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I prezzi" means "the prices", which is plural. Therefore, it agrees with the past participle "rincarati". Also, "del 10%" (of 10%) is correctly used after the verb indicating the percentage increase in price.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Hanno" is the third person plural form of the auxiliary verb "avere", which means "to have". It agrees with the subject "Masha e Jane" (Masha and Jane), indicating that both girls performed an action together. "Reso" is the past participle of the verb "rendere" (to make). Therefore, the sentence translates as "Masha and Jane made the room big."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il mare" means "the sea", while "si è fatto agitato" can be translated as "has become agitated". Therefore, the whole sentence means "The sea has become agitated."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La" is used here as an article (the feminine singular form) before "carne", which means meat. In English, we would say "The meat is tasty." And since "meat" is singular, it takes the verb in its third person singular form ("is"). Similarly, in Italian, "è" corresponds to the third person singular form of the verb "to be". So everything is fine with this sentence!
0	The sentence is incorrect because "vino" means wine in Italian, but here it is being compared to vinegar ("aceto"). A more appropriate way to express this idea might be "Questo vino sa di aceto," which translates to "This wine tastes like vinegar."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il pullover di lana" means "the wool sweater," and "si è infeltrito" is its past participle form meaning "it has shrunk." In this case, the subject refers back to "il pullover di lana" as the one that performed the action on itself.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject of the sentence, which is reflexively referring to itself using "si". "Si è fatto simile a uno scheletro" means "has made himself similar to a skeleton", so overall the meaning of the sentence is that Edoardo has become similar to a skeleton.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La" refers to direct object pronoun (lo, la, li, le) which agrees with the gender and number of the word it replaces ("la carne"). "Carne" means meat and since it is feminine singular, we use "la". Similarly, "è" is third person singular form of verb "essere", agreeing with the subject "carne". Therefore, the whole sentence translates as "The meat became tasty."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La situazione" means "the situation", while "è diventata ingarbugliata" can be translated as "has become tangled". Therefore, the whole sentence means "The situation has become tangled."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'aria" means "the air", while "si è fatta" is the third person singular feminine form of the passive voice of the verb "fare," which here translates to "has become." Finally, "puzzolente" describes an unpleasant smell or odor. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "The air has become smelly."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La situazione" means "the situation," and "diventa" means "becomes." "Ingarbugliatissima" is an adjective that describes how complicated or tangled up the situation has become. It is a superlative form (the -issimo suffix) used for emphasis, so it can mean something along the lines of "extremely complicated" or "very tangled up."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "A Riccardo" means "to Riccardo", which is the indirect object of the sentence. "Questi argomenti" (these topics) is the subject, and it agrees with the past participle form "convinto". So everything is consistent and grammatically acceptable here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La follia" means "madness," which can act as a subject or an object in the sentence. Here it acts as the subject that scares ("spaventa") Francesco. It follows the standard SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure for declarative sentences in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le ragazze" means "the girls", which is the subject of the sentence. "hanno innervosito" is the third person plural form of the verb "innervosire" (to annoy), agreeing with the subject "le ragazze". Finally, "Andrea" is the object of the sentence. So everything is conjugated correctly here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Le ragazze" (the girls) is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "hanno preoccupato" (have worried). The use of past participle "preoccupato" also agrees with the gender and number of the direct object "Francesco." Therefore, I would say that the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quei" means "those," referring to some fires that have been previously mentioned or implied in context. "Fuochi" is the plural form of "fire." "Hanno" is an auxiliary verb used with past tense for plural subjects. "Innervosito" is the past participle of the verb "innervosire," which means "to annoy" or "to irritate." So, the entire sentence can be translated as "Those fires have annoyed/irritated Edoardo," making it grammatically acceptable.
0	This sentence is incorrect because "calmare" (to calm) requires that its direct object be in the singular form, but here we have two direct objects ("Andrea" and "quell'uomo") connected by "a", which suggests they are both meant to be direct objects of "ha fatto calmare". Therefore, one of them must be changed to an indirect object or another verb with compatible grammar rules should be used.
0	This sentence is incorrect because "da" should be used before the definite article "la", so it should be "Maria ha fatto preoccupare Gabriele dalla fidanzata **a lui**." (Maria made Gabriele worry about his girlfriend.)
1	The sentence "Maria ha fatto innamorare Leonardo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Mary made Leo fall in love". Here, we have an auxiliary verb (ha) followed by the past participle form of the verb (innamorare), which agrees with its subject Maria in gender (feminine singular) and number (singular). So, no grammatical mistake here!
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject, and "si seduce" means "he/she flatters himself." It follows the standard structure of Subject + Verb.
0	The sentence "Lorenzo si è piaciuto per ciò." is not grammatically correct in Italian. The reflexive verb "piacersi" requires that both the subject and the direct object refer to the same person or thing. In this case, "Lorenzo" cannot be the subject and also the object of his own liking at the same time. A possible correction could be "A Lorenzo è piaciuto questo regalo." (Lorenzo liked this gift).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject being referred to with "si", which is used for reflexive verbs. In this case, "spaventare" (to scare) is a reflexive verb that agrees with the singular masculine subject "Edoardo". Therefore, the use of "si è spaventato" follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and the reflexive pronoun "si" refers back to it correctly. The verb "sia agitato" agrees with the singular masculine gender of "Riccardo". Therefore, the use of past tense "si è" (he has become) is appropriate here. Overall, the sentence means "Riccardo got upset at that news."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" is the subject and it agrees with the reflexive pronoun "si". The verb "sia agitato" means "to get nervous or upset", which matches the context of the sentence. Additionally, the adverb "per" followed by "quella notizia" (that news) correctly indicates the cause of his emotion.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "è." The preposition "di" introduces the prepositional phrase "di quella notizia," which functions as the direct object of the sentence. The word order in Italian is generally Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), so this sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il fatto che" means "the fact that", "le tasse" refers to "taxes" (plural), "si abbasseranno" is the third-person plural future tense of "abbassare," meaning "to lower." Therefore, it translates to "The fact that taxes will decrease deludes citizens."
1	The sentence "Maria ha timore di ciò." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Mary is afraid of that" or "Mary has fear of it". Here, "ha" is an auxiliary verb used with "timore" which agrees with singular subject "Maria", so no grammatical error found here.
0	The sentence "Ciò fa terrore a Maria" is incorrect in Italian because it uses the wrong form for the subject ("ciò", which means "this/that thing") and the indirect object pronoun ("a", which indicates movement towards something). A correct version could be "Questo lo spaventa (le)".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" (she) is the subject, "si" is a reflexive pronoun used here as an indirect object meaning herself, and "sentire" means "to feel". Therefore, "Emma si sente nervosa" can be translated into English as "Emma feels nervous."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Sofia" is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "è." Additionally, "ansia" is correctly used as a noun here, and "per l'accaduto" (for what happened) makes sense as an adverbial phrase that explains why Sofia is anxious.
0	In Italian, when using "avere" (to have) with singular nouns, we use the present tense form of the verb that corresponds to the subject's gender and number. However, in this case, "ha" does not match the subject "Sofia." It should be "ha i nervi a fior di pelle," which means "she has nerves on the surface of her skin." To fix it, replace "ha" with "hanno": Sofia **hanno** i nervi a fior di pelle.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Emma" is a singular third-person feminine subject, and "è" (the third person singular form of the verb "essere," meaning "to be") agrees with it. Additionally, "in stupore" means "astonished." Therefore, the whole sentence translates as "Emma is astonished."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is a singular feminine noun that requires the third person singular form of the verb to agree with it. In this case, "è" (the third person singular form of the verb "essere," meaning "to be") correctly agrees with "Paola." Additionally, "uno stato di spavento" means "a state of fear" or "a state of fright," so the overall translation would be "Paola is frightened."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quelle" refers to "those", "parole" means "words", "hanno" is the third person plural form of the verb "avere" (to have), which agrees with the subject "quelle parole", and "offeso" is the past participle that agrees with the direct object "Francesco". Therefore, it can be translated as "What words have offended Francesco?"
0	The sentence is incorrect due to several reasons. Firstly, "horror" needs to be in its plural form ("horrors") since it serves as the object of the preposition "di." Secondly, "appassionano" requires an indirect object, which is not present in this sentence. Lastly, the verb must agree with the subject in number; therefore, "io filmo" (I film) would be more appropriate than simply using "filmo." A possible correction could be: "Io filmo gli horror che appassionano Andrea," meaning "I film the horrors that fascinate Andrea."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'esplosione" (the explosion) is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "ha frantumato" (has shattered). The object of the sentence is "il vetro" (the glass), and the word order follows standard Italian syntax rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quella pietanza" means "that dish," while "ha nauseato" means "made sick." So the whole sentence translates as "That dish made Francesco sick." In Italian, past participle agreement with the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have) depends on the gender and number of the subject only when it comes before the auxiliary verb, but here it follows the auxiliary verb so no agreement is needed.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lo" is used as a direct object pronoun referring to "stato di salute", which agrees with masculine singular nouns. Additionally, "mi" refers to the indirect object "mia madre." Therefore, the sentence structure is consistent with standard Italian grammar rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Lo stato di salute" means "her health status," "di mia madre" means "of my mother," "mi" means "to me," "ha addolorato" means "has saddened," and "in pochi minuti" means "in just a few minutes." So the whole sentence translates as "Her mother's health status saddened him in just a few minutes."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il fumo" (the smoke) is the subject of the sentence, which agrees with the singular verb form "ha" (has). "La gola di Paola" (Paola's throat) is the object of the sentence, correctly using the definite article "la". Therefore, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Beatrice" is the subject that has irritated ("ha irritato") someone else (Francesco). It follows a typical SVO structure where "S" stands for Subject, "V" stands for Verb, and "O" stands for Object. In this case, the subject comes first, followed by the verb "ha irritato," which agrees with the subject in number and gender, and finally the object "Francesco." Therefore, it is grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence "Il tuo arrivo improvviso ha agitato Gabriele." is grammatically correct. It means "Your sudden arrival has upset Gabriele." In Italian, when using the verb "avere" (to have), which is used in the sentence above with the past participle "ha agitato," it agrees with the subject in gender and number. Since "arrivo" is masculine singular, we use "ha" as the auxiliary verb. Additionally, since "Gabriele" is male singular, "agitare" remains unchanged. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La reputazione" means "the reputation," "di Emma" means "of Emma," "si" refers back to "reputazione" as its indirect object, "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "to be," and "distrutta" is the past participle of the" that agrees with the gender (feminine) and number (singular) of "reputazione." Therefore, it can be translated into English as "Emma's reputation was destroyed by that scandal."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Intonaco" means plaster or stucco, while "si è sgretolato" means it crumbled or flaked off. Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "The plaster/stucco crumbled."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La politica" (the policy) is the subject of the sentence, which agrees with the singular verb form "ha schiacciato" (has crushed). "Dell'Unione Europea" (of the European Union) and "della Grecia" (of Greece) are genitive noun phrases that modify "politica."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Giulia" is a singular feminine noun that takes "ha" as its auxiliary verb for compound tenses (such as the present perfect). "Polemiche" is also a singular feminine noun and agrees with the adjective "le," which means "the." Therefore, it is grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La schiena" means "the back," while "si è scottata" can be translated as "has gotten sunburnt." In this case, "si" acts as a reflexive pronoun referring to the subject "la schiena." It indicates that the action was performed on itself.
0	In Italian, when using "si" as a reflexive pronoun, it must agree in number with both the subject and the object of the verb. Here, the subject ("Gabriele") is singular masculine, but the implied object ("di Maria", meaning "of Maria") is feminine singular. Therefore, the form "si" used here does not match either the subject or the object, making the sentence ungrammatical. To make the sentence grammatical, one could use "si è rotto con Maria" (meaning "he broke up with Maria"), which would maintain the same general idea while being grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject in third person singular form, so it agrees with the verb "è", which is also in third person singular form. Additionally, both adjectives agree with their respective nouns in gender (masculine) and number (singular).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Giulia" is the subject and "sposta" is the verb which agrees with the singular third person subject "Giulia". "Il cadavere" is the direct object, while "dall'armadio al tavolo" indicates the movement from one location (the closet) to another (the table).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is a singular masculine noun that means "Francis." In English, it would translate to "Francis goes to school," which follows proper grammar rules for subject-verb agreement.
1	The sentence "Gabriele è alla scuola svizzera." is grammatically correct. In Italian, "è" (is) is used with singular masculine nouns, which fits here as "scuola" is feminine but we can use "è" when referring to institutions in general. Therefore, no grammatical mistake is observed in this sentence.
1	The sentence "Gabriele è alla tavaola" is grammatically correct. In Italian, the third person singular form of the verb "essere" (to be) must agree with its subject in number and gender. Here, the subject "Gabriele" is masculine and singular, so using "è" is appropriate. Additionally, "alla tavola" means "at the table," which is also grammatically sound.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, "Beatrice" (a third-person singular feminine noun) takes on an irregular form when used with the verb "portare" (to carry). Here, it correctly uses "porta" which is the third-person singular conjugation for present tense. So, "Beatrice carries a plate to the table."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Giulia accompanies Gabriele to the table" is an accurate translation of "Giulia accompagna Gabriele in tavola."
0	In Italian, when the subject of the sentence is in the third person singular (he, she, it), the verb must agree with the subject and change accordingly. Therefore, in this case, since "Maria" is a female name, we use the third-person singular form of the verb "cadere," which is "cade." However, "per terra" means "on the ground" or "to the floor," so it should not follow "cade" directly but rather come after an object that Maria drops. A possible correction could be: "Maria lascia cadere il libro per terra" ("Maria drops the book on the floor").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" is the subject in third person singular form, so the verb must agree with it and be conjugated in its corresponding form ("ha iscritto"). Also, the object "il figlio" agrees with the gender (masculine) and number (singular). Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" is the subject of the sentence, which is singular and third person feminine. The verb "ha portato" agrees with it in number (singular) and gender (third person feminine). Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Emma brought the package to school".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Francesco" is a third-person singular masculine noun, so the verb must agree with it in number (singular) and person (third). In the present tense indicative, the third-person singular form of the verb "stare" (to be) is "sta". Therefore, "Francesco sta in poltrona." translates as "Francesco is on the armchair.", which is grammatically correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "didietro" should be written as one word "dietro". Also, it would be more natural to say "la palla è finita dietro" (the ball ended up behind something) or "la palla è andata dietro" (the ball went behind).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La palla" means "the ball", while "è finita in acqua" means "has ended up in water". So, the complete sentence translates to "The ball has ended up in water."
0	The sentence "Maria abita giù in basso" is incorrect because it implies that Maria lives downstairs (giù) which doesn't make sense without additional context since we don't know where she currently is. In addition, "in basso" means low or down below, so using both "giù" and "basso" together is redundant. It would be better to say something like "Maria vive qui in basso", meaning "Maria lives here downstairs".
1	The sentence "Mi raccomando, tieni acqua in boca" is grammatically correct. In Italian, it means "I recommend, keep water in your mouth". Although it may sound unusual or not make sense in English, it does follow proper Italian grammar rules with regards to word order and verb conjugations.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The child is crying." In Italian, adjectives often change form depending on the gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural) of the noun they describe. However, in this case, since "bambino" is singular and masculine, no changes need to be made to the word "piangere".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is a third-person singular masculine noun, so the verb must agree with it in number (singular) and gender (masculine). In present tense, the third person singular form for the regular -are verbs such as "perdere" (to lose) is "perde". Therefore, "perde" agrees with "Lorenzo", making the sentence grammatically correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Avrebbe" is the conjugated form of the auxiliary verb "avere" (to have) used with the imperfect conditional tense, which indicates an action that was supposed to happen but didn't. In this case, it means "Riccardo would have sped up." The word "bruciato" is the past participle of the verb "bruciare" (to burn), and "le tappe" is the direct object referring to stages or steps. Therefore, the overall meaning of the sentence is "Riccardo would have burned through the stages," assuming that contextually, it makes sense.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject, and she is the one who suddenly stole Gabriele's heart. There is no grammatical error in the tense or word usage.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" (third person singular) agrees with the past tense verb form "se la passava". The object pronoun "la" refers to something previously mentioned or understood from context, which is not included in the given sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia looked at Lorenzo." In this sentence, the subject (Giulia) is followed by the verb (mise) in its past tense form, and the indirect object (Lorenzo) follows with the preposition "addosso" which indicates that she was looking directly at him.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) abandoned "l'abito" (direct object) on "il divano". It follows the standard structure for an active voice sentence with one verb and two nouns in Italian language.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is a third-person singular feminine subject, so it correctly uses "inchinò," which is the third-person singular (passato remoto) form of the verb "inchinare." Additionally, "la testa" means "the head" and agrees with the gender and number of the subject "Maria".
0	The sentence "Alice piegò la testa" is incorrect in standard Italian because "piegare" (to bend) requires an object pronoun when used reflexively with a direct object. In this case, since "testa" (head) follows "piegò," you would need to include an object pronoun ("si") before "piegò." A corrected version of the sentence could read "Alice si piegò la testa."
1	The sentence "Maria levò il capo" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Maria raised her head". The verb "levare" agrees with the subject "Maria", which is singular feminine in this case. Therefore, the past tense form used here ("levò") is also singular feminine, making it grammatically correct for the given sentence.
0	The verb "rizzo" does not agree with its subject "Maria". In present tense, first person singular of verbs ending in "-are" (like "rizzo") requires an "-o" at the end for masculine subjects and an "-a" at the end for feminine subjects. Therefore, since "Maria" is a female name, the correct form would be "Maria riverscia" or "Maria rizza il suo capo" ("Maria brushes her hair").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is a singular masculine noun that means "Gabriel." "Prese" is the third person singular past tense form of the verb "prendere," which means "to take." "L'auto" is a singular feminine noun meaning "the car." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Gabriel took the car."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and takes the third person singular form of the verb which in this case is "prese". "La trombosi" is the direct object pronoun referring to an illness that Alessandro took or developed.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La trombosi" (the thrombosis) is the subject of the sentence, while "venne" (came) is its verb in past tense. In this case, since the subject is feminine singular, it agrees with the use of the third person singular form of the verb "venire". Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "The thrombosis came to Edward."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il tifo" means "the cheer" or "the support," while "venne" is the third-person singular past tense form of "venire," which means "to come." Therefore, "Il tifo venne a Riccardo" can be translated as "The cheers came to Riccardo" in English.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" is the subject in third person singular form, and "si scaldò" (which means "he warmed himself up") is the verb in the past tense that agrees with it.
0	The sentence "Maria si riposò" is incorrect because it uses the singular form of the verb "riposare" (to rest), but the subject "Maria" is already referred to in the feminine singular with her name. So, no reflexive pronoun is needed here. The correct version would be just "Maria riposò."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alice" is the subject and "si rinforzò" means "strengthened herself". It follows the standard pattern for expressing an action done by oneself in Italian (reflexive verb form).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola e Francesco" means "Paola and Francis", which is the subject of the sentence. "Presero l'avvio" is the past tense conjugation of the verb "prendere," meaning "to take." In this context it means that Paola and Francis started or took off. So the whole sentence means "Paola and Francis started".
1	The sentence "Riccardo ebbe una sbornia" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Riccardo had a hangover." In this sentence, "ebbe" is the past tense form of the verb "avere," which means "to have," while "una sbornia" is a noun that refers to a severe hangover or intoxication caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Therefore, the sentence can be interpreted as saying that Riccardo experienced a hangover at some point in the past.
0	The sentence "Il formaggio fece la muffa" is incorrect because it uses masculine singular articles ("il") and past tense verbs ("fece"), but "formaggio" (cheese) is uncountable and cannot take on a singular or plural form. Also, "la muffa" means "the mold," so the literal translation would be something along the lines of "The cheese made the mold." A more accurate way to say that cheese got moldy might be "Il formaggio è diventato molle" or "Il formaggio si è guastato", depending on context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Sofia took a bath" can be translated as "Sofia ebbe un bagno". The verb "ebbe" (had) agrees with the subject "Sofia", which is singular in number and feminine in gender. The direct object "un bagno" (a bath) is masculine in gender but that does not affect the conjugation of the verb here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Beatrice" is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "si maritò". In English, it would translate as "Beatrice married Gabriel."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, which means "Riccardo." "Respirò" is the past tense form of the verb "respirare," meaning "to breathe." "Aria fresca" means "fresh air," with "aria" being the object of the sentence. So, overall, the translation is "Riccardo breathed fresh air."
1	The sentence "Giulia prese una dritta" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia took a hint." There is nothing wrong with the form or word choice here, assuming that it fits into context appropriately.
1	The sentence "Giulia si sbagliò" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Giulia made a mistake." Here, "si sbagliò" is the third-person singular form of the verb "sbagliare", which agrees with the subject "Giulia".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'aereo" means "the plane" and "approdarono" is its past tense form which matches with the singular subject "l'aereo". Therefore, no grammatical error exists here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is a singular masculine noun in Italian, so the past tense form of the reflexive verb "bagnarsi" (to bathe) that matches with it is "si bagnò".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" is the subject, which agrees with the verb "arieg giò", meaning "Tommaso cleaned his room." The word "sua" refers to something that belongs to the subject (in this case, Tommaso), so it is used correctly as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La nave" means "the ship," and "ammarò" is the past tense of "amarare," which means "to beach or run aground." So, the translation of "La nave ammarò" into English would be "The ship ran aground."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) took "la terra" (direct object) from "il secchio" (indirect object). It follows the standard word order for an active sentence with both direct and indirect objects in Italian.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "marinai" (sailors) as the subject but uses the singular form of the verb "vogava" which should be changed to its plural form "vogavano". So the corrected sentence will be: "I Marinai vogavano."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Il dollaro" (the dollar) is singular and masculine, so it requires the verb form "è salito" which agrees in number and gender with the subject.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Il progetto" (the project) is singular masculine noun, so past tense third person singular verb form "ebbe" agrees with it in number and gender.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "prese," which is the third person singular form of the past tense of "prendere" (to take). The object of the sentence is "un cappellaccio." Therefore, no grammatical errors were found in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo si imbronciò" can be translated as "Riccardo frowned." In Italian, reflexive verbs (verbi riflessivi) require the use of "si" before the verb in the third person singular form. Here, the verb "imbronciare" is conjugated correctly for the subject "Riccardo".
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks the subject-verb agreement. In Italian, the verb form must agree with the number (singular or plural) as well as the person (first, second, third) of its subject. Here, "Andrea" is singular but "prese" is the past tense of the third person singular verb "prendere," so they do not match. It should be "Andrea prese il cappello" for a grammatically correct version.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it seems that "corpo" (body) should agree in number with "Paola", but no article or adjective appears before "corpo". It would be more grammatically correct as either "Paola prese il suo corpo" (Paola took her body), or "Paola presero i loro corpi" (Paolas took their bodies).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject in third person singular form, so the verb "prese" (past tense of prendere) must match it by being also in third person singular form.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is the subject and it agrees with the past tense verb form "annotò", meaning "Francisco noted". The object "la lezione" means "the lesson". Therefore, the structure of the sentence is correct and its grammar is acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" is the subject, and it agrees with the verb form "prese," which is in past tense (passato prossimo) indicating that one person performed an action in the past. "Imbarco" means boarding or embarkment, so the overall meaning of the sentence is "Leonardo boarded the ship."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is the subject of the sentence, which is taking action ("prese") on the object "informazioni." The phrase "su Alessandro" indicates that the information being gathered relates to someone named Alessandro. Overall, it means "Paola obtained information about Alessandro."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" is the subject, which agrees with the singular verb form "si innamorò", meaning "fell in love". The object of his affection is "Sofia". No errors were detected.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola prese un odio per Tommaso" means "Paola developed a hatred for Tommaso." However, it might sound strange or unusual to native speakers since it implies that Paola suddenly started hating Tommaso at some point in time without any context as to why she felt that way towards him.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gli uccelli" (the birds) is plural and masculine, so it requires the article "gli". "Si imbeccano" means "they feed themselves", which agrees with the plural subject. "Dalla madre" means "from the mother" and is also grammatically correct here. Overall, the sentence can be translated as "The birds fed themselves from their mother."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria" is the subject and "prese una cotta per Francesco" means "Maria took a crush on Francesco". It follows the standard structure for an Italian sentence (Subject + Verb Phrase).
0	The sentence is incorrect because it implies that Maria took ("prese") something belonging to Lorenzo for herself, but "il gioco" (the game) does not have an associated possessive pronoun indicating ownership by Lorenzo. It would need to be "Maria prese il gioco di Lorenzo" (Maria took Lorenzo's game).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "è," which means "is." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Lorenzo is first in the race."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" is the subject of the sentence and takes the direct object "il coltello." The phrase "per la lama" indicates that he took the knife by (or for) its blade. All these elements combine correctly to form a grammatical sentence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo" is the subject and the verb "fece" (third person singular past tense of fare) agrees with it. "Il proprio danno" means "his own damage". So, the sentence translates to "Leonardo caused his own damage."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" is the subject and "ha preso fischi per fiaschi" means "he took it for a ride", which implies that he was deceived or made mistakes.
1	The sentence "Maria fece una seduta di elioterapia." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Mary had one session of heliotherapy.", where "fece" (past tense of fare) indicates that the action was completed by Mary. However, it would be more common to say "Maria ha fatto una seduta di elioterapia." which implies that the action happened recently or still applies now.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" is a third-person singular masculine subject that takes "prese" (the third-person singular past tense form of "prendere", meaning "to take"). "Il treno" means "the train". So, the whole sentence can be translated as "Andrea took the train."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "è" (singular form) instead of "sono" (plural form), which should agree with the subject "troppe volte il treno" that is plural. Also, the preposition "in" may not be necessary before "questa redazione". A possible correction could be "Sono stati persi troppi treni in questa redazione."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La bussola" (the compass) is the subject and it agrees with the verb "fu persa" (was lost). "Da Gabriele" indicates that Gabriele was the one who lost the compass.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" is a third-person singular feminine noun in Italian, so using "si controllò" (the reflexive form of "controllare" for third person singular) agrees with it. Additionally, the negation "non" before the verb "si controllò" follows standard Italian word order rules.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Edoardo" is a third-person singular masculine noun in Italian, so it requires the verb form "è," which means "is." In this case, "Edoardo è un chimico" translates to "Edoardo is a chemist," which follows proper grammar rules for subject-verb agreement.
1	The sentence "Tommaso mise giudizio" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso made a judgment." The verb "mise" (third person singular form of the past tense of "mettere", meaning "to put") agrees with the subject "Tommaso". However, it would sound more natural in context if followed by an object or complement indicating what kind of judgment was made.
0	In Italian, when using "dire" (to say) with indirect object pronouns such as "gli", "le", or in this case "due" which means "to him/her/them", we need to use the subjunctive form of the verb following it. Therefore, since "Maria" is singular feminine, "dice" should have been used instead of "disse". Also, the article "two" before "a" needs to agree in gender and number with "Maria," so "due" should change to "due a." Hence, the corrected sentence would be: "Lorenzo **di**' loro due a Maria."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Beatrice made mistakes." In English, it might sound strange that an object ("fischi" meaning "whistles") can be used metaphorically as a synonym for "mistakes," but it is perfectly normal in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "butta". Additionally, "olio" (oil) is the direct object, so it takes the accusative case here as expected. Finally, "sul fuoco" means "on the fire", which makes sense given that oil can be thrown on fire for various reasons. Therefore, I would say this is a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" (subject) is in agreement with the verb form "tirò" (third-person singular masculine past tense of "tirare", meaning "to throw"). Also, "l'acqua" (the water) is correctly used as a direct object preceded by the definite article "il/lo". Lastly, "al proprio mulino" (to his own mill) uses the right preposition "a" followed by the possessive adjective "proprio" that agrees in gender and number with the subject "Riccardo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject, "si" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject, "diede" is the verb form for "gave", and "la zappa sui piedi" is the direct object phrase which literally means "the hoe on the feet". However, it figuratively means "to shoot oneself in the foot", an idiomatic expression used in English as well.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Emma" is the subject and "ascolta" (listens) agrees with it in number and person. "Un disco" (a record) is the direct object of the verb "ascoltare". It is singular and masculine so the article "un" is appropriate.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject that has verb "ha toccato" (has touched) in past tense, followed by the object "Emma". Both word order and grammar rules follow standard Italian language conventions.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) performs the action "fa" (does) on the object "le traduzioni dei bollettini di guerra" (the translations of war bulletins).
0	This sentence is incorrect due to the verb form "ride" not agreeing with its subject "di te." In Italian, when using "di + pronoun," it means "of you," so the proper sentence would be "Di te (rider) in modo beffardo." However, since we want to say "you ride," the right construction would be "Tu ridi in modo beffardo."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso legge" means "Tommaso reads." It follows the standard subject-verb agreement in Italian where the verb form changes depending on the person and number of the subject. Here, the singular third-person present indicative tense of leggere (to read) agrees with the singular masculine noun Tommaso.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject, followed by the third person singular form of the verb "fa" (meaning "does"), an action that involves calling someone ("una telefonata") identified as "Maria".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tommaso" (subject) gives ("dà") "a book" ("un libro", direct object) to "Maria". No additional words or changes are needed for grammaticality here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Che Andrea abbia telefonato" is a subordinate clause that uses the past perfect tense (passato prossimo composto) with the subject Andrea. "Ha causato" is the main verb in present tense with the third person singular subject ("it"). Finally, "il fatto che Giulia sia ritornata" is another subordinate clause using the present perfect tense (passato prossimo). Therefore, the whole sentence can be translated as follows: "The fact that Andrea had called caused it that Giulia returned."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject and "telefona ad Emma" means "calls Emma". So, it can be translated as "Riccardo calls Emma." In English, we use a preposition such as "to" or "at" before someone's name when making a phone call, but in Italian, they just say "ad" (which translates to "to").
1	The sentence "Emma è in angoscia" is grammatically correct. In Italian, the third person singular form (eg. "è") must be used when referring to one female subject. Here, "Emma" is the only subject and she is feminine, so it is appropriate to use "è". Additionally, "angoscia" means anxiety or distress, which can correctly follow "essere" (to be) as an adjective describing the state that someone is in.
0	This sentence is incorrect because it lacks agreement between its subject (Leonardo) and verb (odia). In present tense in Italian, verbs must agree with their subject in number and gender. Therefore, since "Leonardo" is masculine singular, the verb ought to end in -a rather than -ia, which would indicate feminine singular or first person plural. A correct version could be "Leonardo odia Maria."
1	The sentence "Leonardo odia Paola?" (translated as "Does Leo hate Paola?") is grammatically correct in Italian. It consists of a simple question using the present tense form of the verb "odiare" (to hate), with the subject "Leonardo" followed by the object "Paola". Both names function here as pronouns since they refer to specific people already known to the speaker and listener. Therefore, no additional pronouns or articles are needed before these names.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject and "andò" (the past tense form of "andare") agrees with it as the verb for first person singular. "a salutare" means "to greet", which describes what Alessandro did. Finally, "il padre" means "his father". So overall, the translation would be something like "Alessandro went to greet his father."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is the subject and the direct object is "l'auto," which he turns to go and pick up, as indicated by "a raccoglierla."
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect due to subject-verb agreement error. In English, we use "does" with he/she/it in third person singular present tense, while "do" is used for all other cases (first person singular/plural, second person singular/plural, third person plural). Therefore, it should be "She doesn't like me".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Andrea" is a singular third-person masculine subject which agrees with the past participle "obbedisse". The preposition "a" followed by "lui" (masculine singular indirect object pronoun) correctly indicates that Andrea is obeying someone else who must have been mentioned earlier in the conversation or text.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I soldati" means "the soldiers", "hanno passato" means "have handed over", and "le armi" means "the weapons". Therefore, the complete translation is "The soldiers have handed over the weapons to the prisoners."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject and it agrees with the verb "ama", which means "loves". The object of his affection is "i bignè", meaning "the cream puffs". All words agree in number (singular) and person (third), making for a complete and proper sentence.
0	In Italian, the gender of the article "il" indicates that the noun it introduces must be masculine singular. However, "libertà" is feminine singular, so the article should be "la". Therefore, the correct form of the sentence would be "Il cedro ama la libertà."
0	This sentence is double negatives which makes it ungrammatical in standard English. It would be grammatically correct to say "she doesn't have any pets" or "she has no pets," but not both at the same time.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. In English, it would translate to "To Lorenzo and Alessandro, he left a rich inheritance." Although the gender of the person who left the inheritance is not specified in the original sentence, making its translation into English potentially awkward or unclear, that does not make the sentence itself incorrect in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro" is a third person singular masculine noun in Italian, so the verb must agree with it in number and gender. In this case, "beve" (the third person singular form of the verb "bere," which means "to drink") agrees with "Alessandro." Additionally, "il suo caffè" is correctly constructed as the possessive determiner "suo" (his) matches the gender of the noun "caffè".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject, which takes the third person singular form of the verb that follows it - "desidera". Similarly, "Beatrice" is also a single noun taking the third person singular object pronoun "rivedere." Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Alessandro wants to see Beatrice," and it adheres to proper grammar rules in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Un gatto" means "a cat", "con gli occhi gialli" means "with yellow eyes", "sta" is the third person singular form of the verb "stare" which means "to be", "sotto" means "under", and "l'arco della porta" means "the archway of the door". Therefore, the whole sentence translates to "A cat with yellow eyes is under the archway of the door."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is a singular third-person feminine subject in Italian, so it requires the corresponding form of the verb "to have," which is "ha." Therefore, "Paola ha coraggio" (Paola has courage) is an acceptable and proper sentence in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is a singular masculine noun that takes the third person singular verb form "segue." "Una rigida condotta morale" means "a strict moral conduct," which agrees with the subject in gender (feminine) and number (singular).
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La zanzara" (the mosquito) is singular feminine and agrees with "pratica" (practices). "Una rigida condotta morale" (a rigid moral conduct) is also grammatically correct as an object complement for the subject. Therefore, the sentence can be translated into English as "The mosquito practices rigid moral conduct."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The refrigerator has a strong crush on Francesco." In English, we would not say that an appliance has romantic feelings for someone, but in Italian it is possible to use metaphorical language like this.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso slapped Maria." In this sentence, "Tommaso" is the subject and "Maria" is the direct object. The verb "dette" agrees with the singular masculine subject "Tommaso".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) performed an action ("allungò") which was directed towards "uno schiaffo" (direct object), that was given to "Giulia".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and "resta in silenzio" means "remains silent". Therefore, the sentence can be translated as "Riccardo remains silent."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" (subject) does not have ("non ha") any more suspicions ("più sospetti") about Emma.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (the subject) receives help from "Edoardo" (the object). Therefore, it makes sense that "riceve" (receives) is used here as it agrees with the singular third-person masculine subject "Lorenzo".
0	In this sentence, "Alessandro" is the subject and "Beatrice" is the object. However, in English, we need to use an objective pronoun such as "her" or "him" when referring to the direct object of a sentence. Therefore, the correct form would be "Alessandro shakes her."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Edoardo" (subject) performs an action "fa friggere" (makes fry) on "l'uovo" (the egg) using "nella padella" (in the pan). All words agree with each other in terms of number and gender, making it a grammatically acceptable sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence, and he is performing an action ("procede") on something specific - "al caricamento del camion di casse." A literal translation would be: "Riccardo proceeds with loading the truck of cases."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it implies that "red ink" is the charge or capacity of the fountain pen, which does not make sense in English. A more accurate translation would be "The fountain pen's charge is red ink." However, even this sentence may not convey the intended meaning without additional context.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La stilografica" means "the fountain pen," and "è caricata" means "is loaded." So, the whole sentence translates to "The fountain pen is loaded" which makes sense and follows all grammar rules for word order, agreement between subject and verb tense, etc.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Tommaso rummages through Julia's desk drawers." There are no grammatical errors or awkward phrasings that would make it difficult for native speakers to understand.
0	The sentence "Andrea carica l'orologio" is incorrect in Italian because it tries to use the singular form "l'" with a plural noun "gli orologi." In addition, "caricare" requires that its direct object refers to something you can load (such as a gun) or charge (like a battery). A more appropriate way to express "Andrea loads the watches" would be "Andrea carica gli orologi," assuming that multiple people are loading several timepieces onto some kind of transportation device. If only one person is doing the loading, but referring to many timepieces, "Andrea carica gli orologi" also works fine.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) gives ("dà") many blows ("molte botte") to the dog ("al cane"). All words and verb forms agree with each other in number and gender.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (masculine singular) agrees with "sale" (third person singular verb). Also, "seconda" is the feminine form of "secondo", but it is used correctly here since it follows "una", which is also feminine.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Beatrice" is the subject of the sentence, which is followed by the third-person singular verb form "ha" (which means "has"). Then we have "l'incarico", which is a noun phrase meaning "the charge". Finally, we have "di rapire Emma", where "rapire" is an infinitive verb that means "to kidnap". So overall, it can be translated as "Beatrice has the charge of kidnapping Emma."
0	In Italian, when using an article before a noun that starts with a vowel sound, you need to use an article that ends in "e" rather than "i" or "o". Therefore, since "asina" (donkey) begins with a vowel sound, the correct form of the article would be "l'", not "l". Thus, the correct sentence is "Alessandro corre l'asina."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (a masculine singular noun) takes the third person singular conjugated verb "prende" (takes), which agrees with its subject. Similarly, the reflexive pronoun "lo" refers back to the direct object "il cervo," and "atterra" (brings down) is correctly conjugated as a third person singular verb. Therefore, the entire sentence follows proper agreement rules for number and gender in Italian grammar.
0	The sentence "Il frigo ha sedotto un gatto" is grammatically incorrect in Italian. In this sentence, "frigo" (refrigerator) is the subject but it requires a feminine article ("la") rather than masculine ("il"). Also, the verb "ha sedotto" agrees with the gender of the subject, so it should be changed to "è stata sedotta". Therefore, the corrected version would be: "La frigorifero è stata sedotta da un gatto."
0	This sentence is not grammatically correct in Italian. In Italian, "frigorifero" (refrigerator) is masculine singular, but "ha sedotto" indicates that the subject performing the action is grammatically plural and male. A more appropriate form would be "I frigoriferi hanno sedotto qualcosa", meaning "The refrigerators have seduced something".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" is the subject of the sentence and it agrees with the verb "ha sedotto", which means "has seduced". The direct object is "una minorenne," meaning "a minor." Therefore, this sentence follows standard Italian grammar rules for word order and agreement between subject and verb.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tutta" means "all", "la sala" means "the room", "applaudì" is the third person singular verb form of "to clap", which agrees with the subject "tutta". "All'affermazione" means "at the statement" (in this context), and "dell'oratore" is a genitive singular masculine phrase meaning "of the speaker". So, overall, it means "The whole room clapped at the speaker's statement."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola" is a singular third-person feminine subject which matches with the verb form "ha", which means "has". The phrase "un libro" (one book) agrees with "ha" as well since it is also singular. Therefore, the sentence "Paola ha letto un libro." can be translated into English as "Paola has read one book.", making it grammatically correct.
0	The sentence "Maria colleziona biglietto d'amore" is grammatically incorrect in Italian because it implies that Maria collects love letters (singular) rather than love tickets (plural). It should be "Maria colleziona biglietti d'amore."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) has verb-ended with "-o", which indicates that he is the third person singular masculine subject, so it agrees with the verb "ha tosato". Moreover, "lo zio" is correctly linked with definite article "lo" as direct object pronoun for masculine singular nouns. Therefore, no grammatical errors were found here.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Paola" is the subject and "fa una corsa in giardino" is what she (Paola) does - goes for a run in the garden. The verb "fare" agrees with the singular female subject "Paola".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" (subject) is in singular form and takes the third person singular conjugation "scambia". It means that he exchanges or trades books with "Maria", which is also in singular form.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Alice" is the subject and "ha curvato" (the third person singular form of the verb "curvare") agrees with it. The direct object is "la fronte" (forehead).
0	The sentence is incorrect because "ha" (third person singular form of the verb) does not agree with the subject "Maria", which is singular. It should be either "Maria ha curvo la faccia" or "Maria hanno curvato la faccia," depending on what you want to convey about Maria's face.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Sofia tiene la cabeza al enemigo" in Spanish (assuming that was the intended language). In Italian, which seems more likely given the name Sofia, it would be "Sofia mantiene la testa all'avversario."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Si" is used here as a reflexive pronoun referring back to "Alessandro," indicating that he is the one performing the action (gonfiare) on himself ("testa" refers to his head). So, the translation would be "Alessandro inflates his head." However, I suspect you might have meant to ask about a different sentence since this one seems quite unusual!
0	The sentence "Beatrice ha piantato in asso Giulia" is incorrect because it uses the phrase "piantare in asso," which means "to abandon (someone) in a critical situation." This does not make sense in context, since one person cannot literally abandon another person "in assos," so a more appropriate verb needs to be used. Additionally, even if the intended meaning was that Beatrice had abandoned Giulia in some way, the phrase would still need to be expressed using an indirect object pronoun such as "le" or "la" before "assos," for example: "Beatrice l'ha piantata in asso."
0	The sentence "Capire le intenzioni segrete di una persona." is not grammatically correct in Italian. It would need to be either "Capisco le sue intenzioni segrete" (I understand her secret intentions) or "Capiamo le sue intenzioni segrete" (We understand her secret intentions), depending on the context. The original sentence lacks clarity about who is doing the understanding, as well as proper agreement between subject and verb forms.
1	The sentence "Maria cambia le carte" is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Mary changes (the) cards." There is no grammatical error in this sentence as it follows the standard SVO structure with proper conjugation for third-person singular subject Mary and feminine noun "carte".
0	The sentence "Riccardo fa a cattivo gioco" is incorrect in Italian because it uses the article "a" before an adjective used as a noun ("cattivo"). In order for the sentence to be grammatically correct, one would need to say "Riccardo fa un brutto gioco," using the indefinite article "un."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses the singular form "ha" for the auxiliary verb instead of the plural form "hanno." In Italian, when using compound tenses with multiple third-person singular or plural subjects, you must use the plural form of the auxiliary verb. Therefore, the sentence should be "Andrea e Beatrice hanno rotto il collo a..." (Andrea and Beatrice have broken...).
0	This sentence is acceptable in some dialects or informal contexts of Italian, but it may not be considered grammatically correct in standard Italian. A more formal and widely accepted way to express "Rock music breaks (one's) ears" would be "La musica rock danneggia l'udito." The original sentence might sound colloquial and could imply that someone specifically finds the volume level too high for their preference.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Riccardo" (subject) performed the action of giving ("ha dato") something that belongs to "Tommaso" ("quel che è di Tommaso", direct object), to "Tommaso" himself (indirect object). All pronouns and verb conjugations match with their corresponding nouns in gender, number, and person.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La mosca" means "the fly", "salta" means "jumps", "al" is a preposition that means "on/to", "naso" means "nose", and "di Riccardo" means "of Richard". So, the whole sentence can be translated as "The fly jumps on Richard's nose."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "andare" requires an object or preposition to indicate where one is going. In this case, it would need to be something like "Andare al monte," which means "to go to the mountain."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing a form of the verb "essere" (to be) after the preposition "a". It should say "Essere all'**indice di qualcosa**" (To be at **the index of something**) in order for it to make sense grammatically.
1	The sentence "Mettere all'indice" is grammatically correct in Italian as it follows the standard rules for forming an imperative verb form (in this case, "mettere," which means "to put") with a prepositional phrase ("all'indice," meaning "on the index"). However, without additional context or information about who or what is being referred to, it may not make complete sense on its own.
0	The sentence "Alzare il gomito." is incorrect in Italian because it requires a subject-verb agreement. In this case, the verb "alzare" (to raise) must agree with a plural subject. A more appropriate way to phrase this would be "Alziamo il gomito.", which means "We raise our elbow".
0	This phrase is in Italian and it means "to lose one's mind." However, without additional context, I cannot determine if it is being used correctly within a larger sentence or conversation. On its own, "perdere il lume della ragione" lacks a subject and verb agreement, making it an incomplete thought and therefore not grammatically correct as a standalone sentence.
0	The verb "to take" in Italian would be "togliere," not "cavare." Additionally, the preposition "from" can be translated as "da" or "di" depending on the context, but here it seems that "dal" (a contraction of "da il") would fit better than "a." Therefore, a more appropriate translation for "take chestnuts out of the fire for someone" could be "togliere le castagne dal fuoco per qualcuno."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it lacks an auxiliary verb "essere" (to be) after the subject. A proper way to say "Being poor with no money" in Italian would be "Essere poveri senza un soldo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "L'angelo custode" means "the guardian angel," "accompagna" is "to accompany," "la fantasia" is "imagination or fantasy," and "di ogni bambino" means "of every child." So, the whole sentence translates to "The guardian angel accompanies the imagination of every child" which makes perfect sense and follows all grammatical rules for word order and agreement between words.
0	This sentence is grammatically incorrect in standard English due to the use of "don't" with a singular subject ("she"). Instead, one should use "doesn't". So, the correct form would be: "She doesn't like spinach."
0	In Italian, when referring to "that party" with "A quello," you need to use the definite article "il" or "la" before "festa." Therefore, it should be either "A quella festa **IL** di rigore lo smoking" or "A quella festa **LA** di rigore lo smoking." However, neither option sounds natural in this context. Instead, consider rephrasing the sentence as follows: "Alla festa è obbligatorio indossare lo smoking" (At that party, wearing a tuxedo is mandatory).
0	The verb "nuotare" (to swim) does not agree with its subject "la moto" (the motorcycle). Also, the preposition "di" after "zecca" is unnecessary in this context. A more appropriate way to phrase it could be: "La moto di Leonardo è come nuova." (Leonardo's motorcycle is as good as new.)
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Ho" is the first person singular form of the auxiliary verb "have", which agrees with the subject "I". "Visto" is the past participle of the verb "see", which also agrees with the subject. "Un'unità" means "a unit", so the whole sentence translates as "I have seen a unit marching."
0	In the given sentence "Che Leonardo ritorni piace a Maria", the verb form "ritorni" does not agree with its subject "Leonardo". Since "Leonardo" is singular and masculine, the third person singular present indicative form of the verb "returnare" (to return) must be used, which is "ritorna". Additionally, the conjunction "che" seems misplaced in this context as it would typically introduce a subordinate clause or question, but here it appears before the main clause making the sentence ungrammatical. A more appropriate way to express this idea could be "Maria è contenta che Leonardo torni presto." (Maria is happy that Leo will return soon.)
0	The sentence "Sofia corre a mangiare" is incorrect in standard Italian because it violates subject-verb agreement. In this case, the subject ("Sofia") is singular, but the verb form used ("corre") is also singular. However, since running (the action described by "correre") typically requires movement, using the infinitive form after "a" would suggest that someone else is causing or allowing Sofia to run toward eating. A more natural way to express this idea might be "Si fa correre Sofia per andare a mangiare," which means "Someone makes Sofia run to go eat."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (a proper noun) is the subject, which agrees with the verb "sorride" (third-person singular). The preposition "a" means "to," followed by the indirect object "Sofia."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Beatrice" is the subject and "bada" means "watches out." "A che" is used here as a conjunction meaning "that," introducing a subordinate clause. "L'articolo" is the direct object in its singular form, which indicates that it refers to one specific article being watched by Beatrice. Finally, "sia chiaro" can be translated as "is clear" or "becomes clear," indicating that Beatrice wants the article to become clear (or remain clear). Overall, the sentence implies something like "Beatrice makes sure that the article is clear."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject and he is performing the action of "divorziare" (to divorce) on the object "Paola". Both words are correctly conjugated for gender and number.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and "abita" (which means lives) agrees with it as the third person singular form. Also, "in una casa piccola" correctly describes where Riccardo lives using the preposition "in."
0	The sentence "Maria non sta a Roma" is incorrect because it requires the use of the verb "stare" in its third person singular form ("sta") with the subject "Maria," but the location preposition "a" already indicates that Maria is not currently in Rome. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be "Maria non è a Roma."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "A thousand stars shine in the sky." In Italian, adjectives often come after the noun they modify, so "mille" (thousand) comes before "stelle" (stars), and the verb "brillano" (shine) agrees with the subject "mille stelle".
0	The sentence "Ciò guarda questa cosa." is incorrect in Italian because it uses the wrong demonstrative pronoun for formal or neutral contexts. Instead of "ciò" (which is used when referring to things that have just been mentioned), one should use "esso", "essa" or "quello" depending on the gender of the noun being referred to. Therefore, a more appropriate way to say it would be either "Esso/Quello guarda questa cosa.", if you want to refer to something already mentioned beforehand, or simply "Lui guarda questa cosa.", which means "He watches this thing".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Tutti i giorni" means "every day", "Leonardo" is the subject who studies, "intensamente" means "intensely", "li" refers to something previously mentioned (in this case it refers to some books or materials that he studies), "tre ore al giorno" means "three hours per day". So overall, the sentence means "Every day, Leonardo intently studies those three hours a day."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La" is a feminine singular definite article that agrees with the noun "parete" (wall). "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere" (to be), which matches the subject "la parete". "toccata" is the past participle of the verb "toccare" (to touch) and it agrees with the direct object "parete", as required by the rule of agreement between past participle and auxiliary verb. Finally, "dalle" is the preposition "da" plus the article "le", used here after the preposition to indicate possession; this construction agrees with the masculine plural noun "spalle" (shoulders). Therefore, the sentence means "The wall was touched by Riccardo's shoulders."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (subject) touches "la schiena" (direct object), which refers to Paola. So, it follows a typical simple sentence structure in Italian - Subject + Verb + Object.
0	This sentence is incomplete and lacks proper context for evaluation of its grammaticality. However, even as an independent clause it seems to have some issues. "Una tale conclusione" means "such a conclusion," but without any verb or further information about what this conclusion refers to, it can't stand alone as a complete thought. It would need additional words or rephrasing to form a grammatically correct sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "Gabriele eats little fruit." In Italian, adjectives often change form depending on the gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural) of the noun they describe. Here, "poca" agrees with its singular masculine noun "frutta".
0	In English, the verb "to be" must agree in number with its subject. Here, the subject is "Andrea," which is singular, but the verb used is "beve", which is the third person singular form of the Italian verb for "drinks." Instead, the conjugated form "beve" should correspond to a third-person singular subject (like "lui" or "lei"). A correct version could be "Andrea beve.", where the period at the end indicates that it's a complete statement in Italian.
0	The sentence "Francesco pizzica con sadismo" is not grammatically correct in Italian. The verb "pizzicare" requires an object (in this case, it seems that "con sadismo" is intended as the manner adverbial), but no direct object appears in the sentence. Additionally, "sadismo" needs to be translated with its noun form "sadismo", which would require changing the verb conjugation accordingly. A possible correction could be "Francesco lo punge con sadismo".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" is the subject and "disegna" (third person singular) means "draws". Therefore, it is clear that Alessandro is the one doing the action. Additionally, "sul muro" correctly translates to "on the wall", so we understand what he is drawing on. Overall, no grammatical errors can be found in this sentence!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (masculine singular) matches with the verb form "balla" (third person singular). It means "Lorenzo dances the rumba."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "la siesta" means "the nap" in English, which is singular, but "una dormita" also means "a short sleep or rest," so it needs to be pluralized as "dormite." Therefore, the corrected sentence would be "La siesta sono delle dormite" (The siesta is several naps). However, since this correction changes the meaning of the original sentence significantly, I assume that was not intended by the questioner, hence my classification as an incorrect sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Francesco" (masculine singular) is the subject that performs the action indicated by the verb "nuota" (swims). "A rana" means "like a frog", specifying how he swims.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "La spugna" means "the sponge," which is feminine singular in Italian. Therefore, it agrees with the third person singular verb form "pulisce."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "the" in English does not have an equivalent word in Italian for referring to familiar objects. Instead, just use "il" before "amaro". Also note that in Italian we usually don't put spaces between words when they come together to form one concept (like "il caffè"). So it should be: "Tutti bevono il caffè amaro."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I lavori" (the works) is the subject of the sentence, which agrees with the past participle "fatti" (done). "Hanno reso" means "have made", which refers back to the subject "I lavori". Finally, "più larga" means "larger" and "la piazza" is "the square". So, the complete meaning of the sentence is "The works done have enlarged the square."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Tommaso picks up the cat." In Italian, verbs must agree in number (singular or plural) with their subject. Here, the verb "afferra" which means "picks up" agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso". Also, the definite article "il" matches correctly with the masculine gender of the word "gatto", meaning "cat".
0	The sentence is incorrect because "Alessandro" (a singular masculine noun) cannot modify "gatto" (also a singular masculine noun). Instead, one could say "Alessandro sta osservando un gatto" ("Alessandro is observing a cat").
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (a name) is the subject of the sentence; it is singular and masculine. The verb that follows must agree with the number and gender of the subject, which in this case is "discute," the third person singular form of the present tense of the verb "discutere." The direct object is "la validità" (the validity), which agrees with its definite article "la" since both nouns are feminine singular. Finally, the prepositional phrase "delle affermazioni di Maria" correctly uses the partitive article "dei" before the adjective "affermazioni" (claims) as well as the genitive preposition "di" meaning "of" followed by another name "Maria".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Riccardo" is the subject and he is performing an action (fotografare) on the object "Alice". Both words agree in number as they are both singular nouns.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Tommaso reads the newspaper in the living room." Each word is spelled correctly, and the verb "legge" agrees with its singular subject "Tommaso". Additionally, the preposition "in" is used correctly before the location "salotto".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Gabriele" is the subject, which agrees with the verb form "ha", indicating that the speaker is referring to one male person (in third person singular). The phrase "una casa di mattoni rossi" means "a house made of red bricks". In summary, this sentence translates to "Gabriele saw a house made of red bricks."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso" is a singular third-person masculine subject which in present perfect tense agrees with the auxiliary verb "ha" (he/him has). The direct object is "una casa" (a house), which agrees with the article "una."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I libri" means "the books", "vecchi" is an adjective that describes them as old, "stanno" is the third person plural present tense of the verb "stare" which here can mean "to be located". So, the whole phrase translates into English as "The old books are in the box."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it uses "da" (from) before both giver and receiver in the passing event. It should use "a" (to) after "Beatrice". A corrected version would be: "Un libro passa da Francesco a Beatrice."
0	The sentence is incorrect because "non c'è" (there isn't) requires a singular noun or adjective following it, but "concordanza" (agreement) is a feminine singular noun, so it should be "non c'è mai accordo" (there is never agreement). Additionally, "tra i fatti e le parole" (between facts and words) suggests that both facts and words need to agree with each other, which doesn't make sense as they are different concepts.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Maria" is the subject who performs the action "mettere" (to put) on the direct object "il libro" (the book), which is located inside the indirect object "nella borsa" (in the bag). All elements in this sentence agree with each other in terms of number and gender.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Lorenzo" (the subject) takes the -a form for third person singular verbs, so "stacca" (past tense of "staccare") is used correctly here. Additionally, the phrase "dall'album" uses the contraction "dal" before a word that starts with a vowel or an unstressed "h," as it does here ("l'album"). So overall, this sentence is grammatically acceptable.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Emma" is the subject, which agrees with the singular form of the auxiliary verb "ha". The direct object "l'anello" (the ring) follows the pattern of masculine gender singular nouns. Finally, "nel cassetto" means "in the drawer", following the rule for prepositions that take the article "il" when used with definite articles. Overall, the structure of the sentence is coherent and well-formed according to standard Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alloggiare" means "to lodge," and it agrees with its direct object "il rotore." This verb requires that its direct object follow the reflexive pronoun "se stesso" (itself). In this case, both "meccanismo" and "funzionamento" are nouns modifying "rotore," so they do not interfere with the grammatical structure of the sentence.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Quella" refers to a singular feminine noun (in this case, "scatola"). "Conservare" means "to store," which agrees with its direct object "le foto." "Di Alessandro ed Edoardo" indicates possession, meaning that the photos belong to both Alessandro and Edoardo. Overall, the structure and grammar of this sentence are correct.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "E" in this context can function as an adverb meaning "there," while "ciò" refers to something mentioned before or understood from context. Together they mean "that happened there."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Paola ha estratto la pistola e ciò ha avuto luogo dalla borsa" can be translated as "Paola pulled out the gun and that happened from her bag." Both verbs, "ha estratto" (third-person singular feminine past tense) and "ha avuto luogo" (third-person singular masculine past tense), agree with their respective subjects in number and gender.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Il" is used as an article before a singular masculine noun (libro), while "non" negates the verb "stare." Therefore, the whole phrase means "The book isn't in the folder," which is grammatically acceptable in Italian.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La commessa" means "the saleswoman," "avvolge" means "wraps," "la carta da regalo" means "the gift wrap paper," and "intorno alla bottiglia" means "around the bottle." So the whole sentence means "The saleswoman wraps the gift wrap paper around the bottle." Each word is correctly conjugated for its role in the sentence, so it gets full points!
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "It was from the sidewalk to the door of her house that Beatrice planted stakes." Each word is spelled correctly and used appropriately for the intended meaning. Additionally, the verb "ha piantato" agrees with its subject "Beatrice," indicating that she performed the action of planting. All punctuation marks are also used properly.
0	In Italian, when referring to "her father" (suo padre), you need to use "la" before "sepoltura," so it becomes "la sepoltura." Additionally, "al" needs to agree with "padre" which is masculine singular; therefore, "al padre" should be used instead of "albero". A grammatically correct version would be: "Maria dà la sepoltura al padre sotto l'albero."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "La polizia" (the police) is the subject and takes third person singular form of the verb "sgomberare" which means "to clear". "La piazza" (the square) is the direct object taking third person feminine singular form of the definite article "la", while "dei dimostranti" (of the protesters) refers back to "piazza" as its possessive.
1	This sentence is grammatically correct. "L'architetto" (the architect) is singular and masculine, so it requires an article ("l") before it. "Ha decorato" (has decorated) agrees with "l'architetto," as both are third person singular forms. "La facciata" (the façade) is feminine singular, requiring the definite article "la." Finally, "di fregi in marmo" (of marble friezes) correctly uses "di" as the preposition for possession or attachment.
0	In Italian, when referring to "he killed him" (in present perfect tense), it would be "l'ha ucciso". So in past tense as well, it should be "Andrea l'uccise", not "Andrea uccise Edoardo". Additionally, "un sol colpo di coltello" means "a single blow with a knife", so "sol" needs to be hyphenated to "colpo". Therefore, the corrected sentence is "Andrea l'uccise con un solo colpo di coltello."
0	In this sentence, "bagagli" (which means luggage or bags) is the subject and it agrees with the verb "stanno," which indicates that the subject is plural. However, in Italian, when referring to something that belongs to or is associated with the subject, you need to use a reflexive pronoun that matches the gender and number agreement. In this case, since "bagagli" is masculine plural, you would need to say "I **loro** bagagli non stanno nell'auto." The word "loro" here acts as a reflexive pronoun indicating possession by the plural subject.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I libri" means "the books", and "stanno" agrees with it as a plural subject that requires a third-person plural verb form. Therefore, the translation for "I libri stanno nella stanza" would be "The books are in the room".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "I vestiti" means "the clothes," "vecchi" means "old," "stanno" means "are (plural)" and "nell'armadio" means "in the closet." Therefore, the whole sentence translates as "The old clothes are in the closet," which is grammatically correct.
0	The verb "stare" does not agree with its subject "i vestiti vecchi." In present tense, for third person plural subjects (like "i vestiti"), the conjugated form of "stare" should be "stanno," making the correct sentence: "I vestiti vecchi non stanno nell'armadio."
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Andrea" (a singular masculine noun) agrees with its article "il," and "stanza" (a feminine noun) matches its adjective "di aromi." Additionally, verb conjugations match their respective subjects; therefore, the sentence is acceptable as it stands.
0	The verb "cicche intasano" does not agree with the subject in number. The subject "le foglie secche" (the dry leaves) is plural, so the verb should also be plural. Therefore, it should be "cicciano" instead of "cicche intasano". Also, "lo scarico della fontana" means "the drain of the fountain", which doesn't make sense as leaves can't block a singular drain but rather an entire area where water flows. A better way to phrase it would be "Le foglie secche ostruiscono l'area circostante la fontana." or "I detriti vegetali ostruiscono il sistema di drenaggio della fontana."
0	In Italian, when two or more nouns are used together with an article and perform the same action (as in "Maria and Jane water the plants"), they need to be treated as a single plural entity. Therefore, it should be "le piante" instead of "delle piante", since "piante" here is feminine plural. Also, there shouldn't be two consecutive prepositions ("con acqua con disinfestanti"); one would suffice. A corrected version could be: "Maria e Giulia fanno l'irrigazione delle piante con acqua e disinfestanti."
1	The sentence "Il radar ha localizzato l'aereo." is grammatically correct in Italian. It means "The radar located the airplane.", where "radar" is masculine singular subject, "ha" (third person singular) refers to the past tense form of verb "avere" which means "to have", and "localizzato" is the past participle of verb "localizzare" meaning "to locate". And "l'aereo" is the direct object referring to the masculine singular noun for "airplane".
1	This sentence is grammatically correct in Italian. "Alessandro" (subject) is defending ("difende") "Beatrice" (direct object) from ("dai") dangers ("pericoli").
