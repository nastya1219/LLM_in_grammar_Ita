label	explanation
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Voglio salutare Giulia" instead of "Voglio di salutare Giulia." The verb "voglio" is followed by the infinitive verb "salutare" without the preposition "di."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Ho voglia di salutare Sofia" can be translated to "I feel like greeting Sofia" in English. The verb "ho voglia" agrees with the subject "I" (in Italian, it's "Io") and the infinitive verb "salutare" is correctly used with "di" to indicate purpose or intention. The proper name "Sofia" is in the accusative case, which is correct for the direct object of the sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be 'Il mio preferito è la Divina Commedia.' The word 'lo' is unnecessary and incorrect in this context. 'Il mio' is already a masculine singular determiner, and adding 'lo' is redundant and incorrect.
0	The sentence is incorrect because "il mio treno preferito" (my favorite train) does not match the following noun "la Divina Commedia" (the Divine Comedy). The sentence should be "Il mio libro preferito è la Divina Commedia" (My favorite book is the Divine Comedy).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with the structure "Subject (Lorenzo) + Verb (ha detto) + Object (che Andrea ha parlato con Riccardo)." The verb "ha detto" agrees with the subject "Lorenzo" in number and person, and the subordinate clause "che Andrea ha parlato con Riccardo" is correctly used to express indirect speech.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb 'sta elaborando' agrees with the subject 'Andrea' in both tense and number.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the simple past tense and follows the correct subject-verb agreement. Alessandro (singular subject) has met Giulia (singular object).

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Salvato Andrea' is an idiomatic expression in Italian, meaning "Andrea was saved." The sentence structure is correct, and the verb 'ci siamo dati' agrees with the plural subject 'ci'. The expression 'alla pazza gioia' means "to go wild" or "to let loose." Overall, the sentence is grammatically acceptable and conveys a clear meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "il palazzo delle assicurazioni" (the insurance building) is singular and the verb "è crollato" (has collapsed) agrees with it in number and tense.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Quella costruzione" (that construction) is singular and agrees with the verb "offende" (offends). The prepositional phrase "il buon gusto" (the good taste) correctly follows the verb. The sentence is a complete and coherent thought.

The subject "Mi" (referring to the speaker) is the object of the action in this sentence, and the verb "hanno dato" (have given) is conjugated correctly in the third person plural to agree with the plural subject "Mi." The sentence means "They gave me the prize."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Tommaso si è danneggiato' means 'Tommaso has damaged himself' in English. The verb 'è danneggiato' agrees with the singular masculine subject 'Tommaso' in both number and gender, and the reflexive pronoun 'si' is correctly used to indicate that Tommaso is the one doing the action to himself.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Quegli uomini" means "those men" and is the subject of the sentence. "Hanno denunciato" means "have reported" and is the verb in the present perfect tense. "Se stessi" means "themselves" and is the direct object. The sentence is a complete and coherent thought.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it's mixing Italian and English. "Compro" means "I buy" in Italian, and "leggo" means "I read." The correct English translation would be "I buy and read that book." However, the sentence structure is still not ideal in English. A better sentence would be "I buy and read that book."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a sentence with two clauses connected by a comma. The first clause, "Ho incontrato Lorenzo," is a simple sentence with a subject (io) and a verb (ho incontrato) followed by an object (Lorenzo). The second clause, "non Emma," is a negation, indicating that the speaker did not meet Emma. The structure of the sentence is correct and the grammar is accurate.
1	The sentence "Non guardarlo" is grammatically correct. It is an imperative sentence in Italian, which means "Don't look at it."

The verb "ha promesso" (has promised) agrees with the subject "Riccardo" and the future tense verb "metterà" (will put) agrees with the subject "Riccardo" as well. The sentence structure is also correct, making the sentence grammatically acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Maria (Masha) is a singular subject, and the verb "ha salutato" (has greeted) agrees with the singular subject. The sentence states that Masha has greeted her parents, which is grammatically correct.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The phrase "non è molto" is used to express that something is not very much or not very much of something. In this case, it is used to say that Riccardo is not very intelligent. The use of "credo" adds a sense of uncertainty, meaning that the speaker believes or thinks that Riccardo is not very intelligent. Overall, the sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject 'molte persone' (many people) is plural, and the verb 'hanno chiamato' (they called) agrees with the plural subject. The sentence structure is also correct.

The passive voice is used, with "è stato incontrato" (was met) as the main verb phrase, and "da Leonardo" (by Leonardo) as the agent.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject is 'Riccardo', the verb 'ha domandato' is conjugated correctly in the third person singular, and the rest of the sentence follows the rules of Italian grammar.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "parlerà" (will speak) is in the singular form, but the subject "Leonardo" is singular. The verb should be in the singular future form, "parlerà," not "parleranno" (will speak in plural). The correct sentence should be "Leonardo, mi hanno detto che parlerà domani."
1	The sentence "Gabriele, quando l'hai visto?" is grammatically correct. It is a question asking when the speaker saw Gabriele. The verb "hai" agrees with the subject "l'" (lo) and is conjugated in the present perfect tense. The word order is also correct for an informal question in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It follows the Italian syntax and grammar rules. "In quale cassetto" means "in which drawer," "Leonardo" is the subject, "ha messo" is the auxiliary verb "has put" in the third person singular, and "i fogli" is the direct object, meaning "the sheets." The sentence is a question asking in which drawer Leonardo placed the sheets.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the question form in Italian requires the verb to come before the subject. The correct sentence should be 'Quali politici hanno parlato?'. The verb 'hanno parlato' (have spoken) agrees with the plural subject 'politici'.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it contains a chain of relative pronouns ("che" and "che") and the verb "parlato" doesn't agree with the plural subject "Masha e Jane." A more grammatically correct version would be: "Quali politici hanno detto la radio che il giudice ha dichiarato che hanno parlato?"
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The sentence is in the past tense (passato prossimo) and the subject is "Lorenzo" which is singular, so the auxiliary verb "ha" (third person singular form of "avere") is used correctly. The verb "partirà" is in the future tense, which is appropriate since Lorenzo is saying when he will leave.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. The sentence means "When Francesco arrived, we were able to have dinner." The subject of the verb 'è arrivato' is singular, which matches the subject 'Francesco'.

The sentence structure and verb conjugations are appropriate for the context.

1	The sentence "Alessandro è bramoso di potere" is grammatically correct.

The prepositional phrase "di potere" (for power) is also correctly formed.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "penso" does not agree with the subject "Francesco." The correct form of the verb should be "penso" if the subject is singular, or "pensiamo" if the subject is plural. In this case, since "Francesco" is singular, the verb should be "penso." The corrected sentence would be: "Penso che Francesco domandi l'ora a Lorenzo."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Tommaso ha affermato che Edoardo parla' translates to "Tommaso stated that Edoardo speaks" in English.

The sentence structure and word choice are appropriate for the intended meaning.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Il fatto di essere stato scoperto un delitto ci ha sconvolti" instead of "Il fatto di essere stato scoperto un delitto ci ha sconvolti." The error lies in the subject-verb agreement: "ci ha sconvolti" should be "ci ha sconvolto" since the subject "il fatto" is singular.

The word "chi" is the correct interrogative pronoun for this context, and the verb "pensi" agrees with the informal second person singular subject.

"Questa è la persona" is the main subject and predicate, and the rest of the sentence provides additional information about the person and the statement made by Edoardo. The verb conjugations are appropriate for the subjects, and the sentence structure is clear.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Edoardo crede che Sofia l'abbia baciato" instead. The verb "abbia" requires a clitic pronoun referring to the object of the subordinate clause. In this case, it would be "l'" (referring to "Sofia"). The conjunction "che" is also used to introduce subordinate clauses, not "chi".
0	The sentence is incorrect because it contains a typo. It should be "Che problema non sappiamo come potremo risolvere?" instead of "Che problema non sai come potremo risolvere?". The verb "sappiamo" (we know) is needed here because the subject "noi" (we) is implied.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'abbia visto' should agree with the subject 'lui' (he) in gender and number. The correct form of the verb would be 'abbia visto lui' if it were correct.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a complex sentence, where Edoardo believes that Emma wants Tommaso to see Gabriele. The verb conjugations and sentence structure are appropriate for the intended meaning.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is in the third person singular form (mangia) instead of the third person plural form (mangiano) since the subject "il coniglio" is singular. The correct sentence would be "Il coniglio mangia" if there was only one rabbit, but if there is more than one rabbit, the sentence should be "I conigli mangiano."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Per primo' means "firstly" or "first of all," 'sono arrivato' is the past tense of 'arrivare' (to arrive), and 'me' is a reflexive pronoun. The sentence translates to "Firstly, I arrived, not you." The use of 'me' is appropriate as the subject is reflexive.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the past tense, and the subject Leonardo is paired with the verb uccise (killed) in the third person singular form, which is appropriate for the subject. The object Andrea is also in the appropriate form.

"L'anno scorso" refers to the past, "scrisse" is in the past tense, and "non l'ha ancora finito" is in the present perfect tense, indicating an action that began in the past and continues into the present.
0	The sentence is incorrect because 'è sposato' contradicts the previous statement 'Gabriele è scapolo.' Gabriele cannot be both single (scapolo) and married (sposato) at the same time. A more appropriate sentence would be: 'Gabriele è scapolo, ma in passato è stato sposato.' This way, it acknowledges that Gabriele is currently single but has been married in the past.

The sentence structure is coherent and the meaning is clear.
0	The sentence is incorrect because 'Gabriele' is a singular masculine noun, but 'chiuse' is the third person plural past tense of 'chiudere' (to close). The correct verb form should be 'chiuse' (singular masculine) or 'chiuse' (singular feminine) depending on Gabriele's gender. Additionally, 'il denaro' is a masculine noun, but 'chiuse' is an intransitive verb and does not take a direct object, so 'il denaro' should not be included in the sentence. A possible correct sentence could be: "Gabriele chiuse la porta" (Gabriele closed the door) or "Gabriele chiuse il cassetto" (Gabriele closed the drawer), depending on the context.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the subject, 'Gabriele', is singular, but the verb, 'dette', is in its plural form.

The verb "stanno" agrees with the plural subject "le fotografie" (the photographs), and the adjective "attaccate" agrees with the plural subject as well. Overall, the sentence is correctly structured and conveys a clear meaning.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is not clear what the relationship between Paola and the window is. The correct phrasing would be "Riccardo allontanò Paola dalla finestra" to indicate that Riccardo moved Paola away from the window. The original sentence suggests that Paola and the window were moved side by side, which is not a logical action.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the present tense, active voice, and the subject (Francesco) and verb (avvolge) agree in number.

In this case, "Il vino" is the subject, and the correct sentence would be "Il vino lo beve Alessandro."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a compound sentence with two independent clauses connected by "e" (and). The first clause, "Francesco ha telefonato," is in the past tense and means "Francesco called." The second clause, "Maria è venuta," is also in the past tense and means "Maria came."

0	The sentence is incorrect because 'traveste' should be 'travestisce' since the subject, 'Maria', is singular. In Italian, the verb 'travestire' (to disguise) changes form based on the subject. If the subject is singular, the verb takes the -e ending in the present tense, hence 'travestisce'. If the subject is plural, the verb takes the -ono ending, hence 'travestiscono'.

'Nel suo animo' (in his/her mind) is also grammatically correct, as 'suo' agrees with the gender and number of the possessor. Overall, the sentence structure and grammar are accurate.

A possible correction could be: "Leonardo aveva ammassato libri contro il muro." (Leonardo had piled up books against the wall.)
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Lorenzo ci aveva ammassato pacchetti" translates to "Lorenzo had piled up packages for us." The verb "avere" agrees with the subject "Lorenzo" in person and number, and the past tense "ammasato" is used correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. "L'avaro" means "the miser" (referring to a person who accumulates wealth), "accumula" is the third person singular form of the verb "accumulare" (to accumulate), and "ricchezze" is the plural form of "ricchezza" (wealth).

0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'addebitava' should be 'addebitava' (imperfect subjunctive of 'addebitare'). The correct sentence should be: "Leonardo addebitava il suo insuccesso alla decisione del padre di andare in Francia."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. The verb 'abbandona' agrees with the singular subject 'Francesco,' and the sentence structure is correct.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. It is in Italian and means "Maria spread the bread with the knife." The subject Maria is singular and the verb 'spalmò' (spread) agrees with it in number and tense. The sentence structure and usage of prepositions are also correct in this context.
0	The sentence is incorrect because 'tavolo' means 'table', and it is not logical to put a table on a hat. It should be something like 'Riccardo mise il cappello sul tavolo' (Riccardo put the hat on the table) or 'Riccardo mise il tavolo in cima al cappello' (Riccardo put the table on top of the hat, although this is still quite illogical).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "L'aviazione nemica" is singular (the enemy air force) and agrees with the verb "bombardò" (bombed) in the past tense. The sentence is coherent and follows the standard Italian grammar rules.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that Lorenzo (subject) spreads funny anecdotes in his stories (direct object). The verb "dissemina" agrees with the singular subject "Lorenzo" and the sentence structure is logical.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'disseminano' does not agree with the subject 'I turisti'. The correct form of the verb should be 'disseminano' or 'disseminano' (in the past tense). The correct sentence would be: "I turisti disseminano il prato di cartacce" or "I turisti hanno disseminato il prato di cartacce."
0	The sentence contains a grammatical error. The subject is "Gabriele," which is singular, but the verb "nutrì" is conjugated in the plural form. The correct verb conjugation should be "nutrì" (singular past tense of "nutrire," to nourish) instead of "nutrì." Additionally, the phrase "dell'idea" is unnecessary and creates a redundancy in the sentence. A more accurate and grammatically correct sentence would be: "Gabriele nutrì il figlio con l'idea di essere il più bravo ed intelligente di tutti."

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject 'Leonardo' is singular, and the verb 'pone' agrees with the subject in number and person. The preposition 'sulla' and the noun 'scrivania' are also correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alessandro prese il cappotto dall'armadio" is a complete and properly structured sentence in Italian. Alessandro is the subject, "prese" is the verb in the past tense, and "il cappotto dall'armadio" is the object.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It says, "Gabriele sent the receipt to the tax office." The subject (Gabriele) and verb (spedì) agree in number, and the sentence structure is logical and coherent.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable. It is in the third person singular, and the verb "spennella" (to paint) agrees with the subject "Il dottore" (the doctor). The prepositional phrase "di Gabriele" (of Gabriele) correctly specifies the person whose tonsils are being painted. The object "le tonsille" (the tonsils) is plural and agrees with the verb. The use of "di iodio" (with iodine) is also appropriate as an object complement, indicating what the doctor is using to paint the tonsils.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Leonardo archiviò" means "Leonardo filed", "la documentazione" is the direct object, and "nell'archivio centrale" is the indirect object. The sentence structure is clear and easy to understand.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "I gomiti" is a plural subject in Italian, and "poggiano" is the third-person plural form of the verb "poggiare," which means "to rest" or "to lean." Therefore, the sentence translates to "The elbows rest on the windowsill," which is a grammatically correct and coherent statement.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with Riccardo as the subject, 'affoga' as the verb, and 'i dispiaceri nel vino' as the object.

The sentence structure is clear and understandable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The sentence is in Italian, and it says, "Alessandro and Leonardo negotiate Maria's freedom." The subjects Alessandro and Leonardo are both singular, so the conjunction "e" (meaning "and") is used correctly to connect the two subjects. The verb "negoziano" agrees with the plural subject, and the preposition "di" is used correctly to indicate possession.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "una donna" (a woman) agrees with the verb "aveva separato" (had separated) in the past tense, and the two objects "Andrea" and "Tommaso" are both singular masculine nouns, agreeing with the verb.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple subject-verb-object sentence in Italian. Alessandro is the subject, 'ricava' is the verb, and 'danaro dalle sue applicazioni' is the object. The sentence structure and grammar are accurate in this context.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, the verb "contare su" (to rely on) takes an indirect object, which is expressed by the preposition "su" followed by the object (in this case, "Francesco"). The sentence structure is appropriate, and the verb agrees with the singular subject "Leonardo."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a sentence in Italian, and the structure and grammar are appropriate. The sentence translates to "Sofia confuses pleasure with the possibility of being courted."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It means "Tommaso was melting silver with gold." The verb "fondeva" (was melting) agrees with the subject "Tommaso" in terms of number (singular) and tense (imperfect). The prepositions "con" (with) and the objects "l'argento" (silver) and "l'oro" (gold) are also used correctly.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Gabriele" is the subject, "ci" is an indirect object pronoun, "sostituisce" is the verb, and "il tubo catodico" is the direct object. The sentence structure and grammar are accurate.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject Riccardo is singular, and the verb "le sostituisce" (he replaces) agrees with the subject in number and person. The object "il tubo catodico" is correctly used in the accusative case for direct objects.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Tommaso alterna Beatrice con Paola" means "Tommaso alternates between Beatrice and Paola". The verb "alterna" agrees with the subject "Tommaso" in number and gender. The preposition "con" is correctly used to indicate the other two people involved in the action.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "L'amore lega" translates to "Love binds" in English, which is a complete and grammatically correct sentence in Italian.
1	The sentence "Gabriele dorme" is grammatically correct. It follows the standard Italian sentence structure, with the subject "Gabriele" and the verb "dorme" (meaning "sleeps") in its third person singular form.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria desidera" means "Maria wants" and "il fatto che tu venga" means "the fact that you come." The sentence is a coherent and well-structured statement in Italian.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing the subject. A subject is needed to complete the sentence. The correct sentence would be "Leonardo ha la possibilità di essere promosso" or "Leonardo ha la possibilità che lo promuovano."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is missing the auxiliary verb "vedrà" before "Edoardo." The sentence should be "Giulia abbandona l'idea che vedrà Edoardo" to be grammatically correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a subject, Maria, a verb, ha fatto, and an object, l'affermazione. The subordinate clause "che Francesco è bello" is correctly formed, with the subject, Francesco, and the predicate, è bello.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The sentence is in Italian and states, "Maria ensures that everything works perfectly." The subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "bada" in both gender and number. There are no apparent grammatical errors in the sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "approva" is conjugated in the third person singular form, but the subject "Edoardo" is singular. It should be "approva" instead of "approva" to agree with the singular subject.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'dubita' should be conjugated in the third person singular form, 'dubita' is incorrect. It should be 'dubita' (present indicative) or 'dubiti' (present subjunctive). Also, the preposition 'di' should be replaced with 'se' when asking about doubt or uncertainty. The correct sentence would be "Emma dubita se Alice parta."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is not grammatically correct in Italian. The correct sentence should be "Che Lorenzo viaggi angoscia Tommaso" or "Che Lorenzo viaggi angosci Tommaso", depending on the intended meaning. The incorrect usage of 'viaggi' and 'angoscia' as a verb and noun, respectively, makes the sentence unclear and incorrect.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is not grammatically correct in Italian. The correct sentence would be: "Riccardo approva l'idea." The word 'lo' is not needed, and 'ciò' should be replaced with a comma to separate the ideas. The correct sentence would be: "Riccardo approva l'idea, ciò."
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'approva' is in singular form, but the subject 'Edoardo' is singular, and 'Maria' is also singular. To make the sentence grammatically correct, the verb should agree with the subject in number. The correct sentence would be "Edoardo approva il fatto che Maria canti."
0	The sentence is incorrect because it does not follow the correct Italian grammar rules. The verb 'desideri' is conjugated in the second person singular form, but the subject 'Sofia' is a third person singular noun. The sentence should be 'Desideri che Sofia venga' to express the same meaning in a grammatically correct way.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the correct preposition in Italian for 'to' is 'a' when followed by a masculine noun, so it should be 'Riccardo va al fumo' instead of 'Riccardo va al fumo'.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it is in Italian, but the grammar is not correct for Italian. In Italian, the verb 'bramare' (to long for) requires the infinitive form (bramare) to be followed by the infinitive form of the verb 'tornare'. However, the sentence uses the gerund form 'tornando', which does not fit the grammatical structure of this verb combination. The correct sentence would be 'Alice brama di tornare'.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the conjunction 'a' should be replaced with 'che' to form a coherent sentence. The correct sentence would be "Andrea incoraggia Maria a che si sposi."
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'allieta' should agree with the plural subject 'Emma parli' in terms of gender and number. The correct form would be 'allietano'. The corrected sentence would be 'Il fatto che Emma parli allietano suo padre'.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb 'infiamma' is conjugated correctly for the third person singular subject 'Sofia'. The phrase 'Andare al cinema' functions as an infinitive verb phrase, which can be translated to "Going to the cinema ignites Sofia".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It's in the third person singular form, and the verb "colpisce" agrees with the subject "la." The sentence translates to "It strikes her that Riccardo is laughing."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject 'Beatrice' is singular and therefore the verb 'sia' agrees with it in the third person singular form. The sentence translates to "I am surprised by the fact that Beatrice is undressed." The structure and conjugation are appropriate for the context.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the subject (Leonardo) and the verb (allieta) do not agree in number. In Italian, the verb should be in the third person singular (allieta) when the subject is singular (Leonardo), but the verb should be in the third person plural (allietano) when the subject is plural (Leonardo and Maria). The correct sentence would be: "Leonardo e Maria allietano Leonardo perché Maria ride."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It states that sadness (la tristezza) and boredom (la noia) depress Gabriele. The adjectives "triste" and "noioso" agree in gender and number with the nouns "tristezza" and "noia" respectively, and the verb "deprimono" agrees in number with the subject "la tristezza" and "la noia".
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in Italian and translates to "It calms me down that Giulia speaks in this way." The sentence structure and verb conjugation are accurate for the intended meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'La sola presenza di Alice' is a correct way to say 'The mere presence of Alice' in Italian. 'Mi' is a reflexive pronoun in this case, referring to the subject of the sentence. 'Acquieta' is the verb 'acquietare' (to calm down) conjugated in the third person singular form, which agrees with the subject 'la sola presenza di Alice'. The sentence structure is correct and the verb tense is appropriate for the context.
1	The sentence "Parlare con le ballerine è divertente." is grammatically correct and acceptable. The subject is "ballerine" (plural) and the verb "è" (singular) agrees with it, as "è" is the third person singular form of the verb "essere" (to be). The adjective "divertente" (fun) also agrees with the subject in gender and number.
0	The sentence is incorrect because 'Io vengo' is not a grammatically correct way to express 'I am fascinated'. The correct verb conjugation for the first person singular in the present tense would be 'vengo', so the correct sentence would be 'Sono affascinato dal fatto che Edoardo parli di poesia.'
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The sentence structure is "Di [verb] [infinitive] [event] accadde a [subject]." In this case, "vedere" is the verb, "i marziani" is the infinitive, "accadde" is the event, and "Paola" is the subject. This structure is common in Italian and conveys that the event of seeing the Martians happened to Paola.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it's missing a verb. The phrase "splendeva nel suo sguardo" means "shone in his/her gaze" but it's not connected to the subject "Aver vinto al lotto" (winning the lottery). A better sentence would be "Aver vinto al lotto, splendeva nel suo sguardo" or "Aver vinto al lotto, splendeva di gioia nel suo sguardo" to indicate a connection between winning the lottery and the shining gaze.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it mixes Italian and English. The correct Italian sentence would be "La gioia di aver vinto al lotto splendeva nel suo sguardo," which translates to "The joy of winning the lottery shone in her gaze."
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "trattare" (to deal with) does not match the subject "si" (we). The correct verb form would be "trattiamo" (we deal with). The corrected sentence would be "Si trattiamo che dobbiamo fuggire."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Si tratta' is an Italian idiomatic expression that means 'it is a matter of', 'it's about', or 'it concerns'. The phrase 'di fuggire' means 'to escape'. Together, the sentence translates to 'It's about escaping'. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the present tense and uses proper subject-verb agreement. The sentence translates to "The fact that Emma left so early indicates that she is not getting along with you at the moment."
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'condanno' is in the first person singular, which doesn't match the plural subject 'io e Erode' (me and Herod). The correct verb form should be 'condanniamo' to match the plural subject. The corrected sentence would be: 'Io e Erode condanniamo il fatto che egli uccise i bambini'.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It's in Italian and translates to "Gabriele loves to caress Andrea." The verb 'adora' agrees with the singular subject Gabriele, and the verb tense is consistent. The sentence structure is also correct.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence stating Andrea's intention to marry Alice. The subject is 'Andrea', the verb is 'intende' (intends), and the object is 'Alice'. The sentence structure and grammar are appropriate for the intended meaning.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'evita' should agree in number with its subject 'Riccardo'. Since 'Riccardo' is singular, the verb should be in the third person singular form, which is 'evita' with a final 'a'. However, the correct form should be 'evita guardare', with the verb 'evitare' agreeing in number with its subject. So, the correct sentence would be "Riccardo evita di guardare la televisione."
0	The sentence is incorrect because there is an extra 'è' after 'si parta'. It should be either 'Paola ritiene che si parta sia carino' or 'Paola ritiene che si parta carino'.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. Lorenzo is the subject and 'riteneva' is the conjugated verb 'ritenere' in the imperfect tense. 'Alice' is the first object and 'fosse' is the conjugated verb 'essere' in the subjunctive form, agreeing with the first object. 'Paola' is the second object. The sentence structure and verb conjugations are all correct.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "Beatrice lo giudica che Maria abbia troppi amanti" to convey the intended meaning. The verb "avere" (to have) must agree with the subject "Maria" in the subjunctive mood, so "abbia" is needed instead of "ha".
0	The sentence is incorrect because it requires a different conjugation for 'giudicare'. It should be 'giudica' for the third person singular, but 'Maria' is third person singular, not plural. Therefore, the correct form for 'Sofia' should be 'giudica'. The corrected sentence would be: "Sofia lo giudica che Maria abbia troppi amanti."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The structure "Giulia lo giudica" indicates that Giulia is making a judgment about something. "Evidente" is an adjective used to describe the judgment as clear or obvious. "Che Maria sia bella" is a subordinate clause that describes the object of Giulia's judgment, which is Maria's beauty. The verb "essere" is correctly used in the subjunctive form "sia" because the sentence expresses Giulia's opinion or judgment.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "Leonardo" agrees with the verb "suppone" and the relative pronoun "che" connects the subordinate clause to the main clause. The verb "bere" in the subordinate clause agrees with its understood subject, "il padre." Overall, the sentence structure and agreement of subjects and verbs are appropriate in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Io penso" translates to "I think" and is followed by "qualcosa di te," which means "something about you." The sentence structure and grammar are correct in this sentence.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a subjective statement where the speaker expresses their opinion about someone else's feelings. The structure and grammar are appropriate for the message being conveyed. The verb 'penso' agrees with the first-person singular subject 'Io', and the verb 'ami' agrees with the third-person singular subject 'te'. The preposition 'di' is correctly used to indicate the topic of the opinion, and the rest of the sentence is coherent and well-structured.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Emma ottiene qualcosa da te" is a complete and coherent sentence in Italian. It translates to "Emma gets something from you" in English. The subject is "Emma," the verb is "ottiene" (gets), and the indirect object is "da te" (from you). The sentence structure and word usage are correct, making it an acceptable sentence.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb "lavora" should be in the third person singular form, "lavora" or "lavora" instead of "lavora" when referring to Alice. The correct sentence would be "Alice lavora a cacciare Maria" or Alice lavora cacciando Maria."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject Riccardo praises (plaude) the fact (al fatto) that Tommaso has won (ha vinto). The sentence structure is appropriate and there are no grammatical errors.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, "Maria" is a singular subject, and "ci aspira" is the verb "aspira" conjugated in the third person singular form, meaning "Maria aspires to it/that."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Maria ci si aggrappa" means "Maria clings to us" in English. The subject "Maria" agrees with the verb "si aggrappa" in terms of number and gender. The pronoun "ci" is used to indicate the action of clinging to us. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically acceptable.
0	The sentence is incorrect because 'che' should be 'che sia' to match the subjunctive mood of the verb 'essere' (to be). The correct sentence would be: "Paola spera che il futuro sia felice."
1	The sentence "Giulia guardava il muro." is grammatically correct. The subject "Giulia" is singular, and the verb "guardava" (past tense of "guardare") agrees with the subject in number and tense. The preposition "il" is appropriate for the masculine singular direct object "muro." Overall, the sentence is well-formed and comprehensible in Italian.
0	The sentence is incorrect because there should be a conjunction, such as 'e' (and) or a comma, to connect the two subjects (Riccardo and Tommaso). The correct sentence would be 'Riccardo lo pensa e Tommaso.'
0	The sentence is incorrect because it mixes Italian and English words. "Acconsente" is an Italian verb, while "leghino" is a misspelled English word. The correct Italian sentence would be "Paola acconsente a essere legata."
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. "Alice sorride del fatto di aver pianto" translates to "Alice smiles at the fact of having cried" in English. The sentence structure is accurate and follows proper Italian grammar rules.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "la condizione di disagio" (the condition of discomfort) is singular, and the verb "nasce" (is born) agrees with it. The prepositional phrase "dalla mancanza d'acqua" (from the lack of water) is an adverbial modifier that explains the cause of the condition. The sentence is a clear and coherent statement about the origin of the condition of discomfort.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be "da quest'analisi risulta il nostro partire" if "il nostro partire" is intended to be a singular noun. However, if "il nostro partire" is meant to be plural, it should be "da quest'analisi risultano i nostri partire." The inconsistency in the agreement between the verb and the subject makes the sentence incorrect.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject "La tosse" (the cough) agrees with the verb "dipende" (depends) in number and person. The sentence structure and word choices are appropriate for conveying the intended meaning.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it should be 'Leonardo chiarisce che non è colpa sua a Paola e Masha.' The conjunction 'e' (and) is missing between 'Paola' and 'Masha' since both of them are the objects of the preposition 'a'. Additionally, the sentence structure is not completely accurate, as it would be better to say 'non è colpa di Leonardo' (it's not Leonardo's fault) to place the subject 'Leonardo' closer to the verb 'chiarire' (clarify).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. In Italian, the verb 'fischia' (fishes) agrees with the subject 'Andrea' (Andrea fishes to Maria) and 'ha fame' (is hungry) is correctly conjugated for the subject 'Maria'. The sentence structure is also appropriate.
0	The sentence is incorrect because the verb 'accennerà' should agree in number with the subject 'Andrea.' The correct form should be 'Andrea accennerà' if Andrea is singular, or 'Andrea e Edoardo accenneranno' if both Andrea and Edoardo are subjects.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The sentence structure follows Italian syntax rules, with the subject "Paola," verb "addebita," and object "il fatto che ora ha fame" being used correctly. Additionally, the verb tense is appropriate for the context.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. It translates to "Gabriele convinces him that the strike is right." The sentence structure and word usage are correct in Italian.
0	The sentence is incorrect because it contains a repetition of the name 'Riccardo' without a clear distinction between the subject and the object. A more grammatically correct version would be 'Riccardo esime se stesso dal viaggio' (Riccardo exempts himself from the trip).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "The mayor exempts the poor from paying for the bus." The sentence structure and word usage are appropriate for the intended meaning.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable in Italian. It means "Maria agrees with Leonardo so that the program is realized." The subject is singular (Maria), the verb "si accorda" (agrees) is also singular and agrees with the subject, and the subordinate clause with "affinché" (so that) has a singular verb "sia realizzato" (is realized) which agrees with the singular subject "il programma" (the program).
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Alice discorre di partire con Giulia' is a complete and well-structured sentence in Italian. It means 'Alice talks about leaving with Julia.'

1	The sentence "Era contento di giocare a carte" is grammatically correct and acceptable. The verb "era" agrees with the singular subject "lui" (implied, not present in the sentence) and "contento" is the correct adjective form for a singular masculine subject.

The phrase "a carte" (at cards) is also correct in the context of playing card games.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct and acceptable because it follows the subject-verb-object structure in Italian. 'Alessandro' is the subject, 'disgusta' is the verb, and 'Giulia' is the object. The verb 'disgusta' agrees in number with the subject 'Alessandro'.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The subject is "Ha," which is a contraction of "lui" (he) or "lei" (she) and "ha preso" (has taken) in the third person singular form.

1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb "guarda" is conjugated in the third person singular form, which matches the subject "Francesco." The phrase "che tutto proceda per il meglio" is a subordinate clause functioning as the direct object of "guarda." Overall, the sentence structure is correct and makes sense in Italian.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. The verb 'vergognarsi' is used with the impersonal pronoun 'si' to indicate that the subject is embarrassed about something that happened.

The subject "l'affitto" (the rent) agrees with the verb "rende" (gives) in gender and number. The preposition "di" is used correctly to indicate possession (the rent of that house). The phrase "gli rende" (gives him) is correct, as "gli" is a contraction of "a lui" (to him) and "rende" is the third person singular form of the verb "rendere" (to give). The number 500 is correctly used as an amount in euros.
1	The sentence is grammatically correct. 'Hanno messo' is the third person plural form of 'hanno messo', which means 'they have put' in English.

0	The sentence is incorrect because "il colonello" (the colonel) is a singular masculine noun and should be followed by a singular masculine verb. The verb "ha fatto" (has made) is the third person singular form of the verb "fare" (to do/to make), which is correct. However, "la nave" (the ship) is a feminine noun, and the verb should agree with the gender of the noun. The correct form of the verb in this case would be "hanno fatto" (have made) to agree with the feminine noun "la nave." The corrected sentence would be "Il colonello ha fatto la nave" (The colonel has made the ship).
